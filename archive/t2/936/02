Yeah, I'm bummed about it.  There are a couple of other places but not nearly as good to deal with.  Good VW people are becoming few and far between.  Jim was very good, especially engine and electrical.  And a real sweetheart.  I used to sell him axles, shocks, and brakes.  And he sold me the Bopmobile in the first place.  Maybe I should hold a grudge, ha.  Nah, he gave me a great deal.  Some hippie couple drove it here from out west and overheated it.  He had to replace the heads and then they never picked it up.  So I gave him $1,100 for it.  He made $500 on the deal and I came out like a bandit.  That was several years ago and the engine is still strong.   Cheers...KR

30 yrs has to be a great run I hope to be able to do the same.
 
 
 
I hope there is someplace in the area that people will be able to have air  
cooled VW's to be repaired still.
