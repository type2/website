Subject: 1600 upright into '78 sunroof bus

OK here it is, I've read a ton of archive posts and haven't found the info I
need.  I would like to put my a 1600 upright into my '78 sunroof bus.  I
picked up the bus up about 5 years ago with a bad engine, put in a 2000 cc and
drove it around for some time.  I recently pulled the engine to put into my
'74 westy.  fits great!!  Now I have a bus and a 1600 cc engine sitting around
doing nothing so I figure I will install it and use it around town.  What I
don't know is if the crossbar from the '78 2000 will support the type 1
engine????  Also, I was given a "Engine case adapter" from EMPI and I don't
know what it is used for, part number 00-09148-0 and I was also given some
engine mounts, part number 211 199 231 A and I'm not sure if they will fit the
bar????

I've change the bell housing and tranny support on the 6 rib tranny but not
sure how to support the engine?  has anyone done this before and can you give
me some advise and maybe pics??

thanks in advance,,,,, sorry its so long,
