I actually have been running back and forth around Anchorage with mine mostly blocked off with coroplast (plastic sign board).  I folded the pieces in half and managed to get them in behind the metal grates, then zip tied.  Couldn't hardly see them unless you were looking for them.
   
  Today I pulled them off and we'll see when I go to work tomorrow. I can tell not as much air is being pushed out of the vents, but we'll see about temp tomorrow.
