Hi Roy -

Not having used a "Hot Spark" Ignition I cannot offer an informed opinion,
but I do agree with the many points you have addressed.  I'm hopeful that
it's a more reliable unit than what has been offered in the market place for
many years now.

And yes, points are just too "old school" for me as well as others.  Can't
remember the last time I used a "Kettering" system without upgrading to
Electronic Ignition.  I'm getting ready to upgrade my (ahem) 72 411 Wagon to
EI as soon as I get far enough along in it's restoration.

All right, that's enough "guffawing" out there amongst you 411/412
doubters.  Yes, I've crossed over to the "dark side" with VW's Edsel, but
I'm amazed with it's creature comforts when everything's running right ;-)
