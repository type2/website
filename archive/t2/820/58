Mike -
 It appears VW discontinued those nylon seals a very long time ago, as well
as the bushings in 1 piece form which according the 1973 dated OE VW Parts
fiche were only used in 1972. The new replacement bushings (2 per side) are
flanged I guess to act in place of the "seals", at least that's how they
look in the OE VW Parts Fiche dated 1983.
 Looking further at my 1973 dated Parts Fiche and it shows they are
superseded to the 2 piece bushing, solving that mystery.
 211 599 435 A Bushing, Trans Mount Bolt.
 Amazingly enough, they're still available from VW (-at-) $3.77 each
 And on a final note, the photo in Bentley is dated 1974, making no
reference that # 5 & 6 are superseded for both the 1972 and the later
transmissions.
