Subject: To heck with Natural gas

Why not just convert to Producer gas?  What is producer gas?  It was 
used all over Germany and Japan at the end of WWII when we cut off 
their fuel supplies.  It powered everything from VW's to tanks at the 
end of the war.  What is it made from?  Wood for one.  In the late 
70's I remember an American station wagon driven coast to coast on 
nothing but wood scrap cutoffs picked up from scrap piles at new 
house sites.  Talk about renewable energy, not to mention low fuel 
costs!!

Remember the old movie "The Longest 100 Miles"?  They powered an old 
school bus on producer gas made from coconuts.
