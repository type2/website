<<is there a list like this one for squarebacks?>>

Crazy thing you brought this up, and while it's of the beaten path from
the Type 2's I've been thinking about looking for a squareback.

My question is for anyone that knows--( I sure don't )

What kind of engine is in these things?
Pancake, suitcase type, or???

This would make a LARGE difference to me.


Thanks,
