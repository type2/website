Someone said the Audi filter was discontinued, well guess what I found?

Heh-heh, wandered into Canadian Tire today and sitting there was a whole
shelf full of oil filter wrenches for the VW/Audi oil filters no. 021115351A
or 068115568. Made by FloTool in the U.S. it is their wrench no. 1 made of a
phenolic/plastic/nylon material with a 3/8" ratchet hole in the center. Sits
on the end of the filter with 15 "notches" around it's circumference. 5.99
Canadian. :-) Fit perfectly.
