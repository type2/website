Subject: Re: [T2] Suggestions for cleaning longblock

Stephen asked:

 What would be the best way to clean a longblock?  Mine is pretty nasty
 but I am not sure what I can do that won't damage anything.  Also is
 there anything I can do to remove the rust from the cylinders prior to
 rebuilding the engine?

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Spray-on degreaser like Zep Formula 50, Castrol Purple, etc. and then hose off with a garden hose.  For cooked
on crap, I go down to Dollar Tree and get the buck-a-can oven cleaner. Spray on, let soak and work, hose off.

What rust on the cylinders? On the outside or inside?
Outside, big deal.....don't worry about it.
Inside, hone the cylinders or replace the P+C's.
