Hello all:

I live in Miami and Hurricane Wilma removed my camper
top and place it somewhere in Miami. I'm still looking
for it, haven't found it. 

All I have left are twisted brackets on my roof, this
raises a question, where can I find a complete camper
top, brackets and all?

Or shoud I go ragtop? <<-- an idea
