Subject: Who has an 009 with a Petronics module

I just want to find out if mine is, (no number or "signature" on rotor), 
like some one elses, before I tear it apart.  If you have this module in 
your ride, can you give me some direction, as to what the rotor is, before I 
"fix" mine.  I checked the Petronix site to no avail, and thought this might 
be an easier way out. TIA
