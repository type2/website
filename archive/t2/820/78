Subject: Light Assembly Refubish

I'm not sure I picked up all the discussion on this, but just for grins:  A few 
months ago I bought some LED "bulb replacements" on fleabay.  Tested them and 
indeed they work OK.  I had got the idea while driving on the Interstates 
behind trailer trucks, most of which seem to use LED-based tail lights now.  
They seem a lot brighter than the 1157s that used to be typical.  My idea is to 
replace my 1969 incandescents, (hopefully) to drive with a little less fear of 
being bashed from the rear at night.  My reflectors are not the greatest -- but 
with the LEDs reflectors are not commonly used.  Has anyone else tried 
this...???  Glenn
