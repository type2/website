Subject: FS: Locking Engine Hatch Handle for '68-'71 Bus

I mistakenly bought a locking engine hatch handle for a '68-'71 bus several
years ago.
The part number is 211827503D. It  attaches with three screws, not with just
one, as in the later buses. It comes with two keys. It's brand new, never
used.

Here are some pix:

I'll take $25 plus $5 for USPS shipping in the US.
