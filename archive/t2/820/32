<<I agree with Karl... I found this picture,,

Good tool for low lying filter removal, and you won't puncture the side
of the can using large channel locks, and have the oil running down your
arm in the process.
 
<<I heard there was a longer filter avail..>>

Not in Mahle or VW recommended filter's.
Maybe a heavy service AC Delco filter.


 <<<but like those remote filters.. sooner or later you pick up a piece
of debris on the road.. and it punctures your filter.. you could be in a
bad situation.>>

Maybe.

I suppose it's just as close to the probability of a deer jumping up off
the side of the road and flying through your windshield while on the
roll.
Anything is possible.

The advanatage's of the remote set up outwieighs the chances ( which are
two; (a) slim (b) none) of it getting punctured .

If your having troubles getting that filter off it's either been on the
engine way too long, or it got cranked down way too tight.
