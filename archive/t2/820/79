I remember reading a complicated description of how to disassemble and 
refurbish one of these fans. Having been suitably put off when my fan 
started to make laboured sounds I took it out and sprayed WD40 in the hole 
you will see underneath at the fan end. This has fixed the problem for now 
and may help you.

PS. I know this is a shonky fix and that WD40 is not a lubricant and that I 
should have built my own replacement fan from scrap metal! :)))
