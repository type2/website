Subject: Re: [T2] &*^&!!!! oil filter length and removal

I use that one that fits on a 3/8" socket extension and has two arms 
that spiral inwards- I sharpen the edges to grip the German filter 
ridges.  If all else fails, punch a hole in the center and let it drain. 
  Then get a piece of 2x3 and drill holes in it to place 2 10 penny 
nails spaced to fit within the filter diamter.  Whack this into the 
bottom of the filter and unscrew it!

  Is it only me that finds the oil filters tough to remove on the 77 Westy?
  What brands are people using? Mine is an all black filter can with the VW
  Audi symbols on the side, but the *&*&^!!!! thing is just short enough 
that
  my wrench can't get a good grip. Is there a longer QUALITY filter out
  there??
