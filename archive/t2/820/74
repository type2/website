Subject: Re: [T2] Re: &*^&!!!! oil filter length and removal

Don:
   I think your on the right track! Even on aircooled aircraft engines, as
long as the filter is re-installed on a clean flange, and a generous bit of
new oil is rubbed on the gasket of the new filter, as long as it is not
overtightened.... read no more than a half turn past contact... it should
remove easily. There is a Dow product called "DC-4" that can be used, but the
stuff is so slippery that it sometimes causes leaks.
