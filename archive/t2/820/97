I've run craptastic Frams before with no noticable ill effect. But it's not
the filter element that I dislike. It's the PAPER relief valve inside. Give
me metal or rubber.

The blue Purolator (top of the line one, I forget the name) I put in last
time had a nitrile valve. It's well constructed and as a bonus is blue! ;-)

I'm thinking it's time to do another filter cutup with all the new filters
out there. The last one is like 5 years old. Anybody wanna hook up with
BobistheOilGuy and get him to do it? If we each contribute one filter he'll
have plenty to work with!
