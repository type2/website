Subject: &*^&!!!! oil filter length and removal

Is it only me that finds the oil filters tough to remove on the 77 Westy?
What brands are people using? Mine is an all black filter can with the VW
Audi symbols on the side, but the *&*&^!!!! thing is just short enough that
my wrench can't get a good grip. Is there a longer QUALITY filter out
there??
