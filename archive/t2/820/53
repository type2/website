I don't know if you are all trying to get these things off without 
scratching them, but they're trash anyways.  Unless you really have a 
need to remove your filter with the prescribed removal tool for that 
style filter, the 3 arm wrench will take any of them off regardless of 
length or style.  I haven't had a problem yet.  Plus, it's readily 
available as it's craftsman.

Sorry for the rant, just seems like a lot of effort to get something off 
that one tool can handle, especially when aesthetics are not important 
(or maybe they are ;) )
