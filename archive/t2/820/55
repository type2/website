Heh. I was thinking the same thing. =)

I use a tool that has 2 C-shaped arms that get tighter as you turn it with a
3/8" ratchet. But nearly every time I've needed to pull the filter off I was
able to do it with a gloved hand. That's in any car that I did the install
on. Turn it snug, then 1/4 turn past. Never had a leak yet. (Greg's bus
notwithstanding...)
