Subject: How smooth is your poptop

Trying to get a sense of the range of finished poptop surfaces. If (1) 
is like the textured paint in apartments, (3) is a painted canvas 
canoe, (10) is glass, and (9) is new car paint, how smooth is your 
poptop? If the numbers don't make sense, a comparative description in 
English will do nicely.
