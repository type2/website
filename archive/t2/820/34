Subject: Light Assembly Refubish

I am in the process of deciding how to refurbish the parts on my 68 Double
cab. The rear back-up, Brake and front turn signal assemblies are pretty
dull and rusted. 

Is the chrome on the inside that acts as a reflector for the lamps real
chrome? It seems awfully thin and easily comes off when I tried a little
chrome polish.

Question, what can I do to refurbish the chrome? Paint it with chrome paint,
have them chromed or buy NOS?

I can't seem to find anybody selling the NOS lamp bodies for the brake, turn
and backup light. I only find the lenses for sale.

Any guidance would be appreciated

Jon
