The serious side of me says:
This sheath has been on all OE German GEMO supplied cables for the past 28
years I've sold and used them. The sheath does not slide. It's purpose is
truly unknown to the best of my knowledge and research. The why GEMO
provides it and all other mfrs, Brazil Fania/IKS or Italy Cofle, etc., has
never been explained to me. Questions to people in the cable industry (yes,
I have asked this question more than one occasion) usually result in the
atypical shrug of who knows(?).
 The lighter side of me says:
It is there to provide various people (such as myself) to wonder and ponder
about, that it is one of life's true mysteries to speculate about the
ramifications to the known universe if it were to be removed and discarded
like other automotive jetsam and flotsam that appear unneeded.
 My best bud, Cliff, truly a wise Volkswagen person of over 50 years, says
it's there "just because".
 That's good enough for me. If it ain't broke, don't fix it ;-)
