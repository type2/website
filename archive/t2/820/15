NO, 79's should not have that nipple unless an earlier
fan housing was installed. The left nipple is for
circa 77 buses that have the cannister mounted to the
fuel tank wall between the double relay abd the decel
valve.

79's have the cannister standing up behind the right
tail light. So the nipple is now located on the top of
the right upper cylinder tin by #2 intake runner.
