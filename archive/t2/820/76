Subject: Suggestions for cleaning longblock

What would be the best way to clean a longblock?  Mine is pretty nasty 
but I am not sure what I can do that won't damage anything.  Also is 
there anything I can do to remove the rust from the cylinders prior to 
rebuilding the engine?

Any suggestions are welcome.
