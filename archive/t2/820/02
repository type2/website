Type 3s originally shared the same gland nut as their Type 1 & 2 cousins at
36mm hex. However, a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, an outfit
produced a "Super" Gland Nut that was, I believe around 38 40 or even 46mm
hex. I'm not even sure it's available anymore (I think it was Johnny's Speed
& Chrome).
 I'm not saying other places like EMPI/Mr Bug/Autohaus or Dee Engineering
(Bugpack) once offered it, but I don't see it in their current catalogs.
Gone the way of the Edsel I guess (just like Johnny's).
 Now that you have it off, pitch it and put an original 36mm hex Gland Nut
on that flywheel and you (and subsequent owners) won't have this problem
again.

EMPI # 4029 (comes w/washer)
EMPI # 4026 (Chromoly Gland Nut w/Washer)
**Note: EPMI's current 2005 catalog says "features a 36mm size, not a funky
1 7/8" ".
