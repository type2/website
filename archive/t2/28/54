Someone posted a question about touch up paint a while ago.
I bought a set of dove blue from Touch up paint.
I was easy to find on their site & they seemed to have all paint from VW in 
the 50's & 60's.
They delivered promptly and I got both paint in a bottle & a spraycan. I also 
got wet & dry & an overcoat paint,
I guess that the real test will not be the paint but my skill.
