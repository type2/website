Subject: Re: [T2] Chrome plating plastic and middle seat questions

Shawn,

There are folks who do this out there....There was some discussion
on the vintag vw list about this some time ago, but I can't remember
where.

There should be some folks that do this around your area though.
I've beeen to a place that does this sort of thing and seen it done.

I don't think it is "real" chrome, but just looks really good!

Cheers ,dave
