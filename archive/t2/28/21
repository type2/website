Subject: Re: [T2] Friday musings, Buses & Harleys

Dave, list:
Gotta chime in here. I had a couple of Big Twin Harleys when I was 18. Then I
wanted to go fast. Sold them, nearly gave them away. I can see the parallels
between them and VW type 2's.
My dad is 75 years old and wants to sell his BMW. It's an 81 R100/7. The bike
has 47k miles on it. And he's asking $2800.
It's a light silver. This is NOT an RS or RT, just a plain /7. But it has had
good
maintenance and very light use. Too light maybe, pretty carboned up, but that
should be no big problem.
Very little short trips/ commuting miles. Also very little two-up  riding. Mom
has
never been on a bike, Dad usually goes with friends on Saturday mornings. I
should
REALLY buy the thing myself. But it would be a tremendous lifestyle change for
me,
having a bike that actually runs! I've got about 10 British bikes in various
stages of disassembly.
We are in Waterloo, Iowa. POSSIBLY could arrange delivery pulled behind VW type
2 on a trailer.
