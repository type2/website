Subject: Re: [T2] Gel Battery

All points true, if price were the only factor, but,

The Gel type Optima batteries do not ruin your sheet metal if they leak.
This is the main reason a person will choose an Optima (or other gel-type
battery) IMHO.  If I have just repaired a floor pan in my beetle, or a
battery shelf in one of my busses, the last thing I want to do is do it
again.  With a gel-type battery, my battery shelf will not rust out from
battery acid ever again!!  I would rather spend $80 extra now, and have the
peace of mind that another rustoration will not have to be repeated.
