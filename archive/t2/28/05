One of our employees (Chris) here at BUStedBUS.com is a certified BMW
motorcycle mechanic. In his spare time away from air cooled vw engines he
fixes BMW and Guzzies. Not to say anything bad about Harleys but I just
cannot help but think it's the German thing. To quote Chris. They are not
expensive to fix as long as you stay on top of the maintenance. Allot of us
bus owners are reviving buses that just have not been properly maintained
for years. Once dialed in a good VW, like BMW, will roll for ever. Another
guy here drive his 73 panel back and forth from Washington to Colorado
several times a year. With no concerns what so ever.

Actually, you should have replaced those brands w/ Ural or BMW!!  Not only
rugged and dependable, but aircooled German (ok, the Ural is Rooskie, but
they took the BMW plant back home w/ em after WW2)!

As for the VW comparision, I have NEVER seen a VW that took so much
piddling around with just to get it going as I do the Harley boys. I think
Harley MAKES em a piece of crap just for 'the mystique.'  My roomie built a
BMW outta junk yard frame and used parts, drove it thru Mexico and back a
while ago. No problems. Can't beat that German engineering :)
