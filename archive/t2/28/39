Subject: Re: 82 aircooled power

      I want to thank all who responded to my queries about my 82 westy.  I
found them very helpful.  I have decided to keep my 82 for now & try to be
happy with the output.  It drives so well otherwise that I have to keep it.
If I did not have to pass emissions I would try getting rid of the crosspipe
& cat but for now this is the way it has to be.  As far as the mileage goes,
I am going to look for a bug to use for back & forth to work.  I have not
had a bug in years so it will be a new adventure.  Thanks again.
