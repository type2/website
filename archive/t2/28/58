Good point.  I had the same concern, so I bought a plastic battery box
from my FLAPS.  It keeps the nasty stuff inside and a little bicarb of
soda in the bottom neutralizes anything that gets out of the battery.

Works a treat, and cost about $10.

BTW, this is a good idea even with a "sealed" battery.  Even sealed
batteries will vent if they are too hot or overcharged.  This prevents the
cases from being ruptured.  Overcharging can happen if the regulator
fails.
