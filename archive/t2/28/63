A bus brother confirmed opinion of several others when he wrote:

So I wrote:

OK, that's it! I've been driving my '78 Westy with a pair of slightly too
short Audi (?) reatractable belts on homemade L-brackets for years now.
Now I'm officially shopping for a set of uncrashed Vanagon seatbelts to
stick in Westy.

Does anyone out there have a pair of these, including the receivers?
P-mail me and name your price. I'm looking for Vanagon seats too, but I'll
have to get those very locally (Santa Barbara, CA) as they are too big and
heavy to ship cost effectively.
