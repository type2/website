WCM ''lifetime warranty'' ONLY applies to rubber and plastic parts manufactured
by WCM.

Every right side page in the #23 glove box edition starting on page 3 says
'lifetime guarantee' along the bottom. BUT read the bottom of page 1......THEN
read the 1st paragragh on the header page:
<snip>
we manufacture over 60% of all the parts we offer
<snip>
and a real lifetime guarantee (no fine print!) This guarantee on all parts
manufactured by us......

Hmmm.....every page says lifetime guarantee but you don't if they made it or not
until you order it and get it delivered.
