Hi Alex,

My experience is that once you remove the split rings that hold the CV
joints onto the drive shaft then only hand pressure is necessary to slide
the CV joints off; no hammers, no hydraulic press and I'm a 10 stone
weakling.

It could be that someone (or you by hammering) has damaged the spines on the
section of shaft 'outside' of the split ring grove in which case just clean
them up with a file with a triangular cross section. The application of
excessive force could simply just increase the damage making this job
exponentially more difficult.

Good luck

My second question is about CV joints. I was thinking about
getting a inexpensive press some where to remove the
joint from the drive shaft. A big hammer isn't doing the
trick so its either this or someone at a machine shop
with a press.  So how big of a press do I need for the
CV joints and what would be good for other bus projects
also, multiple uses i'm hoping :)

Now to get working on that heat!

Thanks
