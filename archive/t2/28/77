WD 40 sucks as a rust buster......it was designed for water dispersal, not a
penetrent. Get a real penetrent like Liquid Wrench.

Not sure which bolts/nuts you are trying to remove. You should be unbolting it
where the brackets bolt to the frame. Two bolts on each side going up into the
frame.
If I remember right, they are 17mm headed bolts. Yes, they will be tight.
