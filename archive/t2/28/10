Part of it is probably the noise thing.  Most of them sound so awful that its 
easy to jump to the conclusion that they_run_just as bad!  : )

I looked VERY briefly at a couple of them and realized that I could could get 
much more bike in the same v-twin style for a lot less money by buying a 
H*nd* Shadow.  It actually idled, got ~45 mpg, the noise didn't raise the ire 
of my neighbors and it was made in America to boot!  

Based on price and yuppy appeal alone, I would compare Harley ownership less 
to a a VW bus habit and more to a vintage porsche/jaguar/50's era Chevy 
habit.  I suspect most Harley owners pay WAY more for their motorcycles than 
we do for our buses!

I currently have no motorcycle.  When I purchase again, I'm really intrigued 
with older Triumphs and BMW's.  Any listee thoughts? (off list response may 
be preferable so we don't stray TOO far from the list focus!)

thanks,
