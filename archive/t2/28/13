I desperately need the locking ring/escutcheon that secures the =
headlight switch to the dash of my '73 Bus. I have the pull-out type =
headlight switch. If anyone has one of these locking escutcheon/rings to =
spare, please email me at laurenceshaber(-at-)earthlink.net . My switch is =
hanging loose and shorting out on the dash. From what I understand, new =
switches don't come with the locking ring.

Thanks,
Larry
