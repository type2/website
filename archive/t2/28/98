Subject: 78 fi or carb...it lives!


Just an update and a question.

I stuck with the fi and went Friday afternoon and picked up 4 rebuilt
injectors, a cold start injector and a pressure regulator.

Got home about 3:30 and by 6pm was having an "adult" beverage and checking
all connections and moving tools out of the way.

The engine started after about 6 seconds of cranking!

Seems to run ok, I need to work on idle a little bit.
No oil smoke, but some black(I'm running too rich smoke).

Now for a question...it sounds like it needs a serious valve
adjustment...but it's supposed to be hydraulic lifters.

Is it possible that they are gunked up and not "pumping up" or is there
any adjustment that needs to be performed.  I haven't pulled the valve
covers off yet, but will, cause the pushrod tubes are doing some serious
leaking.  I have replacement o rings for that.

I seem to have good oil pressure.  After the engine has been running for
about 5-10 minutes...I can turn it off and it takes about 10 seconds for
the oil light to come back on.

Cheers, dave
