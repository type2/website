Subject: Camper Curtains from 73 Bus for Sale

Just came across a set of gold camper curtains I had stored in the
basement.  These are NOT the mustard checkerboard ones. Just gold. 
They are from a 73 Westfalia and are in excellent condition.  These
are the ones that cover the windshield and driver and passenger
windows.  Will sell for $35 including shipping in US.  Pmail me if
you are interested.
