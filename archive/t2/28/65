Subject: Defroster Dilemma

Greetings to Y'all out there.............

Does anybody on the list know of a service to repaint the defroster lines on 
rear windows?
I know that touch-up kits for rear window defrosters are available (although 
I don't know where).  And, if I have to go that route, I guess I'll give it a 
try although the lines in my rear window are pretty ragged.  And I have seen 
the plastic press-on grids in the past - those are definitely not for me.
But I sure would like a lead on somebody who restores those painted-on 
defroster grids (if such an animal even exists).  Anybody?

Mike
