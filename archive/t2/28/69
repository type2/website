Subject: setting timing on '78

I have a 78 Westy which is new to me and my first type 4 motor, having owned
a splitty and a '70 Westy.  I checked in the type2 library re: timing and it
appears I am supposed to have some sort of timing scale which doesn't seem
to be there on my bus!  I am assuming it fastens somewhere around the outer
edge of the crank pulley??  Is this scale something I can find/buy on its
own?  Does someone have a picture of where it goes / how it mounts?
Questions, Questions, Questions!

Thanks,

Dave
