I need sources and prices to replace some of the tools I lost in my home 
fire: 
- bay window bus tow bar, breaks down, bolts to bumper mounting holes 
- beetle tow bar, clamps to torsion bar 
- AC VW engine stand, with wheels 
most of my tools were craftsman or snap on so I can exchange a lot of them.   
thanks for any info,
