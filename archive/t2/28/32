Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] Friday musings, Buses & Harleys

Well its still friday on the wet coast, I'll put my nickle in. First bike,
CL175, 16 years old, bought it without my parents permisson and parked it in
the side yard. Pretty much set the pace for the rest of my life. Haveing
worked in and owned motorcycle dealerships, I've had a chance to ride a
pretty good cross sample of bikes from YZ50's to 100 inch Harley's. Ends up
that things are the same as our buses, the stock ones pretty much run all
the time and the built ones tend to break (well except my built V-max's)
People pretty much the same too, from racers from across the pond to Angels
from 'Berdoo, they all wanna ride and they all wanna talk shop. Funny how
all my t-shirts either have bikes or buses on them and I have so many
leather jackets. btw, every manufacture has their clunkers, I remember
certain VF500's,TX750's and TS400's and a slew more. If you had one of these
and wondered why they never ran, it wasn't you ; )
