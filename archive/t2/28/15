Subject: Re: [T2] Friday musings, Buses & Harleys

I ride a 99 Fatboy, and do not have to worry about anything other than
routine maintenance.  I think what most people think of with Harleys is the
AMF years, where the bikes were built by bowling alley people.  Also, now
that the engines are shock-mounted they don't vibrate your teeth out quite
so much.

I agree with the noise part, though.  I have "modified" stock exhaust, gives
it that Harley sound, without waking the dead.  I also don't like a VW with
stinger type exhaust that makes it sound like a herd(?) of bees.

Instead of towing my bike behind my Bus, I think I will stretch the Bus and
carry the bike inside.  Hm.
