Subject: RE: [T2] Friday musings, Buses & Harleys

I to have to jump in this thread. I am not sure what kind of Harleys
everybody must be buying, but my father has had many different Harleys over
the last 15 years and I cannot remember him ever having to work on one. The
most he ever did was take the bike to the shop for routine service, 500
miles, 5000, 10000, service. None of these Harleys ever had gave him a bit
of trouble and he rides daily. He has ridden them across the country from
Virginia to South Dakota.

Harleys are good bikes if they are properly taken care of (routine
maintenance). Old ones may not be that good, but new ones are just as
trouble free as an import.
