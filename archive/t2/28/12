John:

Optima's are great.  More expensive, but worth the money.  You'll need to get a starter battery (red top) and a deep cycle battery (yellow top).  They're about the same size as any other battery, so they'll fit fine.  If your charging system is working for the 2 batteries you have now, it'll work with the 2 Optima's.  By the way, don't pay retail.  I just bought a yellow top from a place in New Mexico called TNT Distributing.  $127, plus $16 shipping, $143 to my doorstep.  I can get you a phone number if you can't find them on the web.
