Robert,

They are long enough in my '76 when mounted to the floor.  They ARE mounted 
to the post behing the door in the Vanagon, BUT I had the same concerns you 
did about doing this in my Bus.  I was concerned about weakening the post 
and the lack of strength in the sheetmetal.  The L-bracket just gets screwed 
into the existing hole on the floor where the button seatbelt peice mounts 
(just behind the seat by the front door).  I asked someone my BOW-WOW store 
and they recommended the L-bracket.  Said there used to be a company that 
sold a kit that came with an L-bracket for putting Rabbit belts in a Bug 
(though I've heard Rabbit belts are tto short for a Bus).

Ted
