John,

Correction on the brand of those motorcycles----
aaaThey are better known as " Milwaukee Vibrator's".:>)
And they do require more than occasional periodic maintainence, much
like the VW's.
I myself, as long as I am going to be consumed by  big maintainence
item's, spend my time on English motorcycles,(besides the VW's)
(Triumph, BSA, and a Royal Enfeild)  which I get a kick out of blowing
the doors off of Milwaukee's finest.

And the best part is, most of the yuppie's that I pass don't have a clue
what I'm riding.
