The exhaust should fit just fine.  As I recall, you had a Doghouse cooler
setup on Urge.  Why remove the better cooing system?  I think you can use
the Doghouse cooler with a singleport head.  I may well be wrong (All you
parts book gurus please corect me if I am) but isn't the only different
piece the one that fits the top of the head?  There's gotta be a way.  I
think the rockers are the same too.
Even without a bus, we'd REALLY like to see you at Octoberbus.  Sherry was
talking about digging up Irises the other day.
