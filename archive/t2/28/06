I agree with Tony's statement.  At the risk of being a smart-ass, I'd probably 
get more benefit from sanding down my front end and removing all those rock 
chips and permanently imbedded bugs in my 28 year old paint job than I would 
from an air dam.  How about a teflon-coated bus?  (Hey, it's Friday!)
