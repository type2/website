I'm going to just coat the battery shelf with POR-15 (which may or may not
be completely rustproof, but it is acidproof), set the battery in a boat
battery box for extra assurance, and be done with it. Much cheaper and as
effective.

If I had a Miata, which comes stock with a gel battery because it rides in
the trunk with a little bit of your stuff, that would be different.
