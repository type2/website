I agree with Karl,, use liquid wrench, but be careful with the bracket to frame
bolts in a rust prone area,, they may snap off... 

If you can leave the brackets on the Van, and just remove the bumper to bracket
bolts, you can break them and buy new ones,, and no fiddling with the captive
nuts in the frame

there are 4 on each side, 2 on top of bumper and 2 below
