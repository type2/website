I understand Costco has a gel type battery for a good price.......also,
wholesale on an Optima is around $95.......a friend that owns a vw shop was
just pitched by the sales rep.

They're about the same size as any other battery, so they'll fit fine.  If
your charging system is working for the 2 batteries you have now, it'll work
with the 2 Optima's.  By the way, don't pay retail.  I just bought a yellow
top from a place in New Mexico called TNT Distributing.  $127, plus $16
shipping, $143 to my doorstep.  I can get you a phone number if you can't
find them on the web.
