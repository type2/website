Subject: Re: [T2] Friday musings, Buses & Harleys

Oh god, a thread I shouldn't mess with, but I'm gonna
step right on in.

I've been a motorcycle rider for 15 years. I've had
some standards, one cruiser, and two sportbikes, both
of which I currently own. 

I've been doing VW's just as long, and can't count all
of those that I've owned at this point. 

I still don't get the Harley thing, and here's why - a
vintage car has a right to be slow, expensive to buy
and maintain, and a lot of work to keep on the road. A
brand-new motorcycle has no business being any of
these things. 

Rather than using myself as an example, I'll use my
father, since he rides big cruisers, and nothing but.
Every time he goes to get a new bike, he looks at a
Harley for the "caché," but always buys a Japanese
cruiser. Why? As he has repeatedly explained to me, he
wants to ride his motorcycles as much as possible, not
work on them. The thrill of the open road is only
there when your bike is not in the shop. That, and he
gets twice the bike for half the money. How do you
argue with that?

Also, take note - there's nothing different about a
Harley, other than being overpriced and difficult to
maintain. They make a ton of them, and every dentist
and accountant I know has one. Just being a biker is
different enough.
