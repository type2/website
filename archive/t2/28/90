If it were required to re-torque the heads the the engine would have be 
designed a lot differently, like not having to remove all that tin and or 
removing the engine to do so? Over torque will cause the studs to pull out, 
if ya did it right the first time and you have no leaks due to it, then it is 
best if left alone. It was designed that way, that is why there is no mention 
of re-torque.
