Subject: Do Two Buses Make It an "Event"?

Hey Folks,
     Well my attempt at getting "Buses Near The Bay" going again didn't draw
a big crowd. Only Mike Benthin showed up! Well, that's OK, I enjoyed talking
to Mike, and to be honest, even though the weather was nice and my daughter
and I really enjoyed the boat trip over to Smith island, the mosquitoes were
HORRIBLE! Folks at the campground office told me they stopped spraying for
mosquitoes since the season was "winding down", even though the campground
was full. Hmmm, makes sense. Also, my '77 Westy ran beautifully the whole
way down and back, so good in fact, if I didn't have to go to work tomorrow
I'd have just kept driving!    Jeff
