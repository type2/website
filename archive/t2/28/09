Subject: 70 Deluxe Bus For Sale Parts / Project, Calif

I still have my 70  bus for sale.  It would be good for parts or a project.
It was manufactured 9-69.  Bus has sun roof, dash is still in bus, rear
seat, front seats, the majority of the chrome trim strips on the sides, VW
badge on rear hatch, some interior pieces, front end, steering box -
steering wheel is complete, rear end.  I'll have some updated pictures later
this afternoon and I'll post links to them then.  I'd prefer to sell the
rest of the bus together but if you are only interested in certain parts let
me know what you are interested in and I might continue parting it out.  I'd
like $150.00 for the entire bus now, it's in Hesperia California.  Email
directly for more info and I'll have the new pictures this afternoon.
John
