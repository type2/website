Subject: Re: [T2] Brake affecting idle? Also my idle problems..

Thanks.. Good points about the fuel/air leakage (being interchangeable).
It's just such a brain tease, because it's basically a new carb, still shiny
from the box, and it's been used relatively little. The bus sits in the
drive most of the time.. But then, maybe that has something to do with it?
