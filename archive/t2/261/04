Getting it out is not too hard _if_ the bearing is installed properly.
Proper installation is flush with the outside end of its blind hole.  If
the bearing is pushed in all the way to the bottom it is a pain to remove.

There is a special tool called a "pilot bearing puller" which is very
helpful.  hook it behind the bearing, turn the crank, and out comes the
bearing.

Lacking this, you can use a chisel to cut the bearing's outer shell
(careful not to nick the hole!) and remove the pieces with needle-nose
pliars.

Be sure to give this a dab of grease (I use Bosch distributor point
grease, as it is very thick) or it could sieze up, a very bad thing as it
can lead to the pilot shaft coming out of the transmission upon removal!
