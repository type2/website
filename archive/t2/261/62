Subject: Before and after shots of seats using TMI covers

Just thought I'd post these quickie shots of before and after seats in my 70
Bug. I've got two seats side by side, one with the new upholstery and one
not done yet. What a difference! Final adjustment on the new upholstery
wasn't finished yet, and buttons weren't replaced. But check it out! You
have to add the seats to this link below.
