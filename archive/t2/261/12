OTOH, I never take them out unless there is a reason to do so.  Remember
that this bearing does not turn unless the clutch is disengaged.  IF the
vehicle is highway driven, the bearing gets very little wear.  In the city
it gets more, particularly if the driver rides the clutch at stoplights.

I've only had one of these go bad on me in thirtymumble years of driving.
