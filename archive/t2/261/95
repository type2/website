Subject: Newer Alternator

I was wondering if any of the newer VW alternators
will work on the type 4 engines.  I would like
something that will through allot of amps and I
thought maybe an 80's VW with A/C may have something
half decent.  I found a 70 amp alternator at cip but I
was hopping for something I could look for at a
wreckers.

Thanks,

Matthew
