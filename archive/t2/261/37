Subject: Re:  [T2] engine out, anything else to replace

My engine's out too, and it started the same way...clutch not working due to
melted pilot bearing.  I went ahead and had the engine rebuilt while it was
out, and I'm trying to look at everything that's easier to access with the
engine/tranny removed. I'm doing all the things you listed plus:

Engine main seals (front & rear)
Tranny seals (front, rear, and drive shafts)
Fuel Lines (For sure)
Vacuum lines
Rubber intake manifold boots
Fuel injector seals
Clutch cross-shaft bushings & seals
Rear wheel bearings (clean & inspect, replace if needed)
Rear brake pads and adjusters
Open up, inspect, and rinse out the gas tank compartment behind the engine
Clean all electrical connectors
Lots of gaskets
EGR valve, tubes, & filter $$$$ (%^$(-at-)#(-at-)%$)
Replace all rusted exhaust nuts & bolts


Some of this stuff depends on the condition, but I'm being conservative...I
don't want to have to pull the engine and tranny again in 6 months to
replace a $3.95 oil seal...

As for the muffler, it might be easier to remove it after you put the engine
back in.
