It's not.  Nor is it a Schofield part.  At one time, he apparantly received
some dented replacement noses, and cut the top halves off of them and sold
them separately. I'm told he doesn't have any more. The noses are Brazilian
and are the same ones we sell.   They're pretty much the same as the German
nose on the later bus, except that the spot where the emblem mounts is
protruded slightly (which looks good, albeit slightly different from "German
spec").  While the nose is for the later style busses (turn signals above
headlights), we do sell the parts for using it on an older bus.  Or if you
just have windshield rust you can cut it in half yourself and just use the
upper part (which is the same on all years).  We sell the whole nose for
$219.95 (part number 95 56 200).  This price already includes additional
shipping/handling charges due to its size, so only the normal
shipping/handling fees apply beyond that.   If you only need the top half
(for rust repair), in some cases (depending on inventory) we can cut a nose
in half for you and only ship the top half. This would cost about $60 less
due to savings in shipping costs (it could go via UPS whereas the whole nose
cannot).
