Subject: new to this late model bay bus world

Well we have moved up into the bay window world.  After 2 splits and two 
years on the other list, we just picked up a 68 double cab with disc 
brakes and 71 tranny.  We will be looking for bay unique information.

It needs a rear door seal, does someone make it?  Also looking for the 
chrome side red rear reflectors.  Also have to get the high beams working.

Overall in pretty good shape.  Look forward to traveling around with our 
scamp trailer in tow starting from our home base in southern california.
