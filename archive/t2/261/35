Subject: Lots of  engine questions

Hello List,

I am sitting here in front of my rebuilt 914 engine. I
am currently installing some of the engine tin. My
question is, can I completely assemble the engine
before I install it in my bus? Can I go ahead and
install the parts of the f.i. that attach to the
engine? Would it be easier to put the foam seal that
goes around the perimeter of the engine tin before or
after I install it? 

I am trying to make sure that each thing that I put
back on the engine is installed correctly and in good
order. I have the alternator out and was wondering If
there is anything that I should think about replacing
or checking before I install it on my engine. It
seemed to work when it was on the old engine 4 years
ago. I just don't want to have to pull it after I
install the engine.

Oh, and the thermastat flap on the right side does no
close all the way when you push it down. There is an
aluminum knob that protrudes from the shroud that
keeps it from going all the way down. Is it suppose to
be this way?

Should I install the heater boxes before or after I
install the engine? I do not have a set yet and was
wondering If I had to wait on them to install the
engine.

Any answers would be most appreciated. I couldn't have
made it this far with out you. Thanxxx!!!!!!!!!!
