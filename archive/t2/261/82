Subject: Bleeding brakes [follow up]

There is a question at the end...

I bleed my brakes for the first time today.  That last time I did any
bleeding whatsoever was on my 1971 beetle back in 1990.  There were the two
of us, and it was a pain especially with me lying on my back in a gravel
driveway and with my friend on the pedal.

Here's what came out, it was really ancient:

I did all the bleeding by myself with the Motive Power Bleeder.  It was a
cinch.  It's was $45 and more expensive that the mighty-vac but it came on
good recommendation from my friend who visits the racetrack and changes his
fluid often. It has to be the easiest way short of using professional
equipment.

Beware: there are two VW models 0100 and 0104. That latter, 0104 has a cap
that fits the tiny aircooled VW reservoir.  I didn't buy it direct from
Motive and got duped by a description from another vendor and what I got was
a bleeder for a water cooled VW.  Buy it direct from Motive (they also sell
the funky blue brake fluid).

Luckily Motive rocks! and they sell an adapter kit which contains more hose,
the right cap and some brass fittings and clamps.  I already loaned it to a
buddy to use with the other cap.

To use, I filled up the reservoir, pumped it up to 15 psi, did the rear
brakes, pumped it back up to 15 when I moved from the rear to the front and
then did the front.  Very little air came out from the top bleed nipples
after I flushed from the bottom.


Brown brake fluid came out of the back cylinders but out of the front
calipers also came a black silt that's hard to see in this picture.

I flushed about 1.5 litres of bad fluid out:

Now, my questions for anyone who read this far:

Because the brake fluid sat in the reservoir so long it coated it and when
disturbed in any way, the coating flakes and floats in the fluid.  You can
see some of the flakes I sucked out:

I'd like to remove the reservoir and clean it out but the hose below doesn't
want to come off and I'm afraid it's expensive or NLA and I'll regret
breaking it.

I think the hose to the lower reservoir and the lower reservoir is coated
the same way and I'm inclined to just leave it everyone as it is because of
the work involved.

Advice?
