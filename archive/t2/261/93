Subject: 3rd tail light suggestions?

Folks,

I am getting ready to llok for a 3rd taillight to mount on my 78 std bus.

Anyone done this?  Got any favorite locations or sources that look good?

I'm thinking about the lower part of the rear hatch window rather than the 
top because I don't want to lose even the limited visibility from the
rear view mirror.

Since I haven't gotten the headliner back in yet, I figure that this is 
the best time to do it so i can run the wire for it inside the roof line
up to the fuse box.

Cheers, dave
