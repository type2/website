Subject: pilot bearing

 Any thoughts on how to get the old one out?  I recently had my engine out
so replaced the clutch assembly as a matter of convenience and an oil soaked
disk.  The kit had a new pilot bearing, but as I did  not immediately see a
way  to remove the old one and it seemed clean and free, I just left it in
and put the new one away in a baggy.  Is this like the main seal in that you
just grab parts of it and pull the cage apart and take the needles out?  Old
one only has 87K on it.

Most VW FLAPS have 'em, looks like a small needle bearing.  VW PN

It's located at the end of the flywheel side of the crankshaft
