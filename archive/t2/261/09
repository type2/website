Subject: Pilot bearing

Definately should take out the pilot bearing from what
i have been told.  I had mine go on me about 2 weeks
ago and it makes your car pretty much undrivable.  87K
on it may be enough that it is at the end of its life.
 You should be able to rent for free a bearing puller
from any of the major auto parts stores, some loan
them out and some charge a little bit.  Either way, it
makes the job a lot easier.
