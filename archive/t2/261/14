Subject: Pilot Bearing Clarification Please

OK, PLEAAAAASSSEEE correct me if I am wrong, but is the Pilot bearing not
found inside of the flywheel gland nut?? And if it indeed is, wouldn't buying
a $9.99 new gland nut be MUCH easier than pulling the pilot bearing out and
re-installing it? I have been under the assumption that the gland nut and
pilot bearing are in essence one part. Can any of you experts enlighten me?
Peeace, John Baker
