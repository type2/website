I just put the order in for calipers.  The guy at my FLAPS wasn't too =
much help.  They are both stamped ATE (that narrows part of it down).  =
The only numbers I can find on my old calipers are as follows:

Driver's Side: 3
Passenger: 13

Does this clue anyone into what year these are from?  As a reminder, =
Funky is a '71, but I was told he had the upgrade to '73-'79 brakes.  I =
want to absolutely make sure I get the right stuff.  I'd hate to blow a =
seal out of a brand new pair of calipers!

If I remember correctly, something I read said they switched over to =
Girling brand in '74 or '75.  Any ideas?

Have a good one,
Eric
