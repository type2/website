Subject: Body panels

Folks,

Can anyone confirm these US distributors for Alan H Schofield body panels
mentioned in the archives?

http://www.wolfgangint.com/
http://www.bus-boys.com/
http://www.type2parts.com/

They have a 3 piece under the windshield repair panel for =A325.00. See #29 o=
n
http://www.ahschofield.co.uk/page6.htm.

None of the above websites have any info about this panel in their catalogs
and it's just what I need.

I have no idea who else is making body panels for bays but is this item
available from anyone else? I understand Veng is gone but who is the other
European maker of body panels?
