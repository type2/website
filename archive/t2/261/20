Subject: Vanagon H2O lock & key blanks

Someone (Phil) mentioned that the early Vanagon campers had a keyed lock on 
the H2O fitting.

I was not familiar, but in just the past four weeks, I came across TWO of 
these elusive H2O locks, and only one had a single key.


More info::

Well, I found a source for the ILCO DM 31 key blank, and the locksmith wants 
a minimum order of 5 key blanks, at $3 per key blank.

Anyone, other than Phil interested in this purchase??

I plan to go for 4 key blanks for the two locks I found already.

P-Mail me, please...
