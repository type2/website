Subject: FW: Re: [T2] Lots of engine questions


Hi David,

I'm about where you are in this process...

My engine came out pretty much complete (except air cleaner/AFM), but I
think it will have more clearance going back in without the distributor. I'm
going to cover the hole and make sure the engine doesn't rotate with the
dizzy out.

 >Can I go ahead and install the parts of the f.i. that attach to the

I'm going to install these first...I think it would be a PITA to do inside
the engine comp.

Hmmm.  Good question...

See my previous post "Re: [T2] engine out, anything else to replace").  My
alternator's pretty well used, but I think I'm going to throw it back in the
fray for now.  I agonized over this, but it can be replaced without pulling
the engine if necessary.

I just went out and looked at mine...it looks the same as you describe, so I
guess it's normal.

My exhaust/heater stuff came off before I dropped the engine, and it appears
to be much easier to install after the engine is back in.  Good Luck!
