Subject: re: A couple more brake questions...

I've seen various late Baywindow buses with either Girling or ATE calipers. It
seems that VW used whichever brand of calipers that they happened to have in
stock at the moment. My '79 had Girling calipers when I rebuilt the brake
system. I couldn't locate rebuilt Girling calipers at the time, but ATE
calipers were plentiful, so I used ATE instead. I had to replace the short
pieces of steel brake line that screw into the calipers with some new ones I'd
bent to fit, but otherwise it went pretty smoothly.

r.d.
'79 bus

I just put the order in for calipers.  The guy at my FLAPS wasn't too =
much help.  They are both stamped ATE (that narrows part of it down).  =
The only numbers I can find on my old calipers are as follows:

Driver's Side: 3
Passenger: 13

Does this clue anyone into what year these are from?  As a reminder, =
Funky is a '71, but I was told he had the upgrade to '73-'79 brakes.  I =
want to absolutely make sure I get the right stuff.  I'd hate to blow a =
seal out of a brand new pair of calipers!

If I remember correctly, something I read said they switched over to =
Girling brand in '74 or '75.  Any ideas?

Have a good one,
