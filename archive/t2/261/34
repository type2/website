Subject: headliner...TMI...problems..one more timee


Guys,

Having trouble with TMI headliner(78 std bus)

Surely someone else on this list has replaced a headliner besides me and 
one other guy that p-mailed me.

Anyone seen the video for headliner replacement that is out?

Pmail me if bashfull<grin>.  I am getting ready to get real serious with
TMI if I don't get some good answers from them tomorrow.  Basically, their
headliner is *not* made like the original and does *not* fit well!

Not so cheerfull, dave
