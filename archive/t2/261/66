Subject: Tie Rod and Damper question

Looked under my 71 bus this morning and noticed that on the front right tie
rod the rubber/bushing by the front wheel was cracked, I can grab the tie
rod and twist back and forth (Probably not good) and the damper looks to
have oil all over it like it might have been stressed by the busted boot
thing.

My question is (beside replacing the "adjustable" tie rod and damper) is
that the last couple of months the bus was getting harder and harder to turn
,could this be the cause? 

Also the left tie rod, the "non-adjustable one looks reaqlly good, can I
replace the one tie rod without having to do both?

Thanks 
Trey
