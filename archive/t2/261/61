Subject: Re: [T2] Body panels

While you are checking, maybe you can let me know about that bulge part.. if
it is available.
Some people may be interested to know, also, that someone makes a piece that
can convert a front end panel into a '71 or below. It's a narrow strip that
goes across the front and has the cutouts for the lower mounted turn
signals. I thought that was nifty!   Jan B
