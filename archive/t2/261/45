Subject: Re: [T2] sliding door part needed

 I talked to a welder and he says they are aluminum and he could never weld
it strong enough, I needed a new part and my mechanic is at a loss in
finding the part himself.

Not necessarily true! I had exactly the same thing happen to my '69 bus.. It
was also an aluminum "L" shaped piece, like you say.. The door came off the
track and fell, then this piece broke. I had it welded, and it worked just
fine, up until last year, when I had the vehicle scrapped for other reasons.
It broke on me about 14 years ago, so it lasted all that long.
Some welders may not want to bother with a little job like that, but I feel
that it can be done. Similarly, I had a bracket for the accelerator pedal on
my '70 Ford PU that somehow snapped, and as it was only potmetal, I was told
that it could not be done. I found someone willing to try, and he did it for
a few dollars. I had that vehicle for 13 years and never had any more
problem with it. Keep asking around and you'll find someone who has a little
more confidence and willingness to try... On the other hand, have you
considered cleaning it really well and fixing it with JB Weld? If you
absolutely cannot find anyone to weld it, you might try that, but be sure to
let it cure real well. I don't know if it would or wouldn't work.. Just take
your steel-toed boots camping with you! LOL.. If push came to shove, and
this is a really rare, wierd piece that you cannot get anywhere else, you
could take it to someone who would make a mold and cast it for you. Or.. You
can go to a junkyard.. Try Jack's Foreign Auto in Wilmington, CA. Don't have
a phone number.. try information.
