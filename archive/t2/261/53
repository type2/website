 I've replaced the bad horn with a good horn and was just wondering about
 the most common problems, hoping for a shorted day tomorrow.

ist check power to horn.   Clib under bus, there are two wires to the horn.  
the ones that runs up the steering column is ground.  the other is power.  
check to make sure there is power.   okay, get in bus and take horn button 
off wheel.  sand inside wheel so button can ground well.   sometimes cleaning 
up this ground fixes it.   Get a battery charger out and test horn- might as 
well remove it and test it on a bench- if runnung power though it makes noise 
its fine.  new ones are about $10.
