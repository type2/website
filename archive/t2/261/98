Subject: Fuel pumps and bucking

So, my '71 1600 is creating quite an amazing amount of
bucking, especially transitioning between 3rd and 4th
gears and always under load (going up hills). Usually,
I can feather the gas enough to prevent it but the
second I give it some pepper, she feels like she's
going to break apart. I haven't checked anything
beyond the timing. Oh, and I changed the fuel filter.
I have a feeling it's the fuel pump. My question is
this:

Does a failing mechanical fuel pump tend to create
these bucking characteristics more often when the
engine is hot, because the engine runs perfectly when
cold. This problem only begins to occur about 4-5
miles into a drive.

Thanks,

Doug
