Sounds like fuel is leaking into the 3/4 side. Things to look at are:

Is the solenoid on that side working?

Is the float level correct?

Have you got the bakelite spacers between the manifold and the carbs?

I had a similar problem with my weber ict 34s on the same side. Ended up with
a couple of litres of fuel leaking into the oil. So before going any further
check the oil level and sniff the dipstick. Don't drive anywhere if there is
fuel in your oil.



Greetings,

I put a rebuilt 2.0l in my '73 Westy and after about 300 miles top highway
speed seems to be about 65mph.  The bus runs great otherwise.  Two major
things I found, #3 and #4 plugs blackish, sooty looking while #1 and #2 nice
brownie brown.  Also while syncing the carbs, after turning off the engine
white smoke was coming out of the left carb (3 and 4 side).

Things I have done, checked valves, set timing, synced carbs.
2.0l hydraulic lifters, SVDA, dual solex 32/34 PDSIT2 left and 32/34 PDSIT3
right (rejetted from 127.5 to 132.5 main to accommodate larger displacement).
I have had the bus for 20 years and my mom bought it in '78 (5 years used) so
PO issues are small.

With those two symptoms I hope some one on the list has a direction to point
me towards.

Thanks,
Tom
