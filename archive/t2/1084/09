Subject: Re: [T2] Tires

I bought the Hankooks from BD and I think the shipping was $10 apiece.  
They were still cheaper than ordering them from around here.  
(Chattanooga)  But I think I paid $20 to have them mounted and 
balanced.  The shop that did it could have ordered them but they seemed 
happy that I had taken care of it myself.   I can vouch for the tires.  
They are the best I've used on the Bopmobile.  With the mild winters 
here, they're all I ever need.  Ciao....KR
