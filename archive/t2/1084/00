Subject: Re: [T2] Tires and age warning

The answer to this FART will include a warning.  Get 185R14C Load range 
D or 8 ply rating. C=reinforced   Buy nothing less than a tire rated to 
hold 65 lbs inflation and over 1800 pounds.  It must be stiff enough 
(have a higher sidewall rating) to prevent sideslip of the bus under 
windload or hard turning maneuvers.  I've used Michelins and Goodyear 
Wrangler LT tires in same rating, but they are much more expensive and 
I've had better wear on the reasonably priced Hancooks, as has my 
daughter driving straight (13 hrs at 65 mph) from Savannah to NJ 2-3 
times for last 4 years....
    How old were the tires?  They should be marked with a DOT number 
indicating week and year; older ones (too old!) had just month and year. 
  A tire that is over 6 years old has outgassed its plasticity compounds 
and MAY show cracks and delaminate the tread entirly if overheated or 
hits a pothole.  Happened to me on a Spanking "new" tire taken from the 
spare tire cabinet of  a camper that was 21 years old.  Ask me for a pic 
of what happend to a never used foldable tire taken from a 74 cabinet 
and blown up to spec.
