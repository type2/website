Just take what you've got to the hardware store and ask for some help. A 
regular hardware store usually stocks individual bits. Even our Mom & 
Pop hardware stores have that sort of thing.

Sears mostly sells kits of things. On the plus side I have bought some 
Sears kits cheaper than individual Sears tools like sockets...
