Are you thinking of the lower engine tin between the heat exchangers
and crankcase that conceals the pushrod tubes?

It is not part of the cooling system. As the name suggests, it
protects the pushrod tubes from road hazards. I usually don't use them
so I can more easily watch for oil leaks and loosening exhaust
manifold bolts. Of course the down side to that is I have lost an
exhaust stud once since it was free to fall out straight to the
road....

Hi All,
Does anyone know where I can get a gravel guard for my '78 Westy? I have
never seen one and I don't know what they look like. I do have one for the
front.
