Hi Matt,

I ordered the Hankooks from Bus Depot and had them installed by a local tire
shop (Kal Tire).  I got my Nokian winter tires through Kal Tire locally.  I
imagine they can order in all-season Nokian tires that are in the
appropriate size and rating, although Nokian tires are pricey.  Where in
Canada are you located?
