Subject: Head Scratching Spark Problem

Hello list members, I was a long time list member but have been off for the
past couple years tending to other priorities (sinful I know)



I am having a problem and am hoping somone here can help.  I can't get my bus
started, I pulled the #3 spark plug out and held the end grounded while my
wife operated the starter and saw no spark until she backed the key to the run
position, at that point I get one spark.  I pulled the center wire off the
distributor cap and held it about 3/8" away from a ground while my wife ran
the starter, I got a nice blue spark repeatadly.  These results are consistent
with what I am experiencing when I try to start the bus, it cranks and cranks
but no firing, then when I turn the key off (past the run position) I get 1 or
two fires from the engine.



What could be going on here, I am guessing I need to try replacing the cap,
rotor and wires since that is all that is between the coil wire and the spark
plugs right?  The spark plugs are new, and I even tried another set.  What I
don't understand is why I get that spark when the key is turned back to run.
Also the cap, rotor and wires are 2 years old but only have about 700 miles on
them. (sad yes)



for backround information, I just had the engine out while I replaced cylinder
heads, I don't think I connected anything wrong on the reinstall as I am
pretty meticulous with labeling but you never know.  compression is 120lbs in
all cylinders, fuel pressure looks good at 35psi, fuel injectors are new from
german supply.



Any help would be appreciated, I am trying to get this running for the
weekend.



Thanks,

Ken Fricke
