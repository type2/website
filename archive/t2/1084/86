Subject: high beams on bug.

Hi All,

 

Well, I cleaned the contacts on the on-off switch. I pulled the fuse box
down and cleaned all of the contacts. Everything pushes on tightly. I
wiggled the connections to make sure they were properly seated. Now not only
doesn't the high beam come on, now all of the parking light and the license
plate light fails to come on. I DID manage to fix the windshield washer.

 

AAAAARRRRRRGGGG!!!

 

Bob
