Subject: Westy spotted on Vancouver Island - Washington plates


Hey, was coming down island towards Nanaimo today when I spotted an orange
Westy with a bike on the front, and a Bugpack single header/muffler on the
back. It had specialty Wa. state plates, and three stripes on the sides of the
body. Also had a solar panel in the back window, and a bumper sticker that
said "It's not farmland if there's no farmers".
Anybody on the list??
Courtney
