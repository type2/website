Subject: RE: [T2] Head Scratching Spark Problem

 I was definately looking at it incorrectly, that is when the circuit closed
as when it should fire.  Funny thing is that the pertronix was triggering, I
could put my meter on the negative side of the coil and see it open and close
as I rotated the engine.  Even more confusing is why the bus  now works
considering I seem to have been backwards in how the coil worked.  Here is how
I got it working:



First I discovered that in my endless adjsuting I had rotated the distributor
so far that at TDC the rotor was pointing about 45 degrees before the #1 spark
plug (hence why I couldn't get any spark). So I rotated it back so it lined up
with the notch in the rotor then:



1) I  reseated the pertronix ring on the distributor shaft.

2) I loosened the distributor clamp, put a meter on the negative side of the
coil and rotated the distributor until my meter would go from 0 volts to 12
volts at 7.5BTDC.  To be clear I would have 0 volts as I rotated from say 20
degrees BTDC and as I got to 7.5 BTDC I would hear a click and the meter would
jump to approximately 12volts. I couldn't find my muir book that talked about
how to statically time the engine but this is how I remembered it.  Of course
my Bently manual only talks about timing with my timing light which I couldn't
do since I couldn't get the bus to start.

3) I turned the key and it fired right up, it did idle fast around 2000rpm but
I figured that was just because the static timing wasn't accurate enough.

4)I let it idle for about a minute and then shut it off happy I had found the
problem and vowing to warm it up and set the timing dynamically tonight.



At this point I give up understanding what the hell I was doing and just
accept that I will be able to get the timing right tonight when I use the
timing light:)   Any tips on how to do it.  Everything I read says to adjust
the idle speed first, but then when you start moving the distributor the
engine speeds up or slows down so do you just iterate back and forth until you
have the right timing at the right idle speed?



Thanks,

Ken
