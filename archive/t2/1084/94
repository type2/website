Kenneth, congratulations on the fire-up...I would really check closely to make
sure that the pertronix magnetic ring is fully seated on the shaft and on the
same plane as the magnetic pickup.  I have several pertronix units running on
several VW's and the magnetic ring was extremely difficult to get lined up
correctly and seated fully on a few of them.  It seemed to go down on the
shaft in just about any position without being fully seated.  I'm not sure how
yours could have been what seems to be about 45 degrees off and fully seated
at the same time.  Greg

Got the bus to fire up!!  I don't know how I missed it but it seems the only
problem was that the little pickup for the pertronix, the ring that goes on
the distributor shaft was somehow not in the right position.
