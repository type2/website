Subject: dropping front axle

The bad news of the day is that the swing lever is siezed and it has broken 
the weld on the axle so down it has to come and get replaced,,oh joy!!  The 
steering column was out when we bought the rig and we were told it was just 
to do some work on the dash,,,all front end parts are newly replaced so 
guess they couldn't find the problem,,,has anyone ever had such a problem? 
Any tips on dropping the front end?
