Take a trip to the states.  Find a hankook dealer along your route. 
Order tired from them and have them put on when you roll through town. 
I'm able to get RA08's mounted, balanced and my old tired disposed of 
for around $80 a piece last time I did this.  Granted I only had to take 
a road trip to Boulder, CO.  It was about 20 miles round trip :)
