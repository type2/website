Subject: Re: [T2] Head Scratching Spark Problem

You've proven that the keyswitch is working properly. You have fat spark
repeatedly at the coil wire. I suspected the double relay when you said that
it sparked when the switch was released to "RUN." The fat spark at the coil
discounts that theory.

New theory: Massive load on the starter or low battery
voltage so there is insufficient voltage for the ignition. Problem with that
is the fat spark repeatedly at the coil wire.

Only thing left I can figure is
that there is either a path to ground inside the distributor (or cap) or your
Pertronix is not shoved down far enough on the shaft and your rotor and/or cap
are now damaged / cap is cracked / coil wired backwards (nah!). Closely
inspect the coil / rotor / wires. Wires DO fail! Try a different plug wire (if
it was only #3 the engine would still run, though.) Last but probably should
be first: If you installed the plug wires incorrectly or you have somehow the
wrong alignment of the terminals inside the cap relative to when the Pertronix
is triggering the coil, there would be little or no spark at the plugs. How or
why that alignment may have changed, I don't have a theory, but for now I'm
late for work so gotta go. Let us know how this progresses, please.
