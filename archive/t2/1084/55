You may be doomed - while you can get bit sets, the only ones I know of that you can buy a bunch of is the #2 phillips.  I have a strange feeling (may be wrong) that there is something unusual about the bits which hold them in place - you may have to replace the whole unit for the lack of 2 bits (or in this case, one bit). ;-)

You can also try something like MCSDirect, oer some other outfit that has electricians tools - I think that's who I found my bit for my Yankee Screwdriver with.  Good luck.

Obligatory Bus Content - Why not use something like brass expanded metal screen for the insulation hold-up - it doesn't rust and will drain.  However, remembering the old wall soundproofing ceiling tiles back then (remember the white stuff with the 1/8" hoes?), it may have served a similar purpose - I have yet to find something that VW-Werke did that didn't cover at least 2 or 3 bases to accomplish something.

Hey everyone,
I have an awesome screwdriver that has proven to be invaluable working 
on everything (including the bus).  This is it:

It's got 6 bits and you can quickly change from one bit to another which 
is super slick.  These are what the bits look like:

Sooo.. one day I was using it and I broke the smallest screwdriver bit - 
it says "1/8 taiwan" on it.  I've called Sears, Craftsman, and every 
other 1-800 number that has anything to do with Sears and nobody has a 
listing for a 1/8" bit.  I've also looked on google and I can't find a 
1/8" in flathead bit anywhere.  It's a really small bit that has been 
really handy (fits the really small flathead screws).

Does anyone have any idea where I can find that 1/8" flathead 
screwdriver bit??

Thanks!
Mike
