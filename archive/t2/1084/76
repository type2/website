Subject: Swing lever kit quality?

Recent inspection of my steering system revealed tell-tale vertical 
movement in the tie rods...so I need to replace the swing lever bushings.

 From what I can tell, there are kits made by Febi and Meyle out there 
from the various vendors.  Are there significant quality differences 
between the two?  I got at least 90,000 miles out of the current parts 
(unknown if the PO ever changed them), and would like to get at least 
that many miles out of the next set.  :)

Thanks for insight!
