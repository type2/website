Subject: Re: [T2] Tires and age warning

I don't think Mike meant it rudely. The warning he refers to is about
tire age, not a warning to you personally about the FART. I've also
heard FART is Frequently Appearing Redundant Topic, which is much more
neutral in tone. I don't think he meant a personal affront to you. But
even so, this kind of response should not be sent to the list. I don't
know that blocking a listee's email won't keep it out of your in box
since mail comes from the list, not the individual.

Meant in good spirit. Just trying to help.

John
