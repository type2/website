Ok in response to Mike Benthin: Why do answer questions if you are
going to be rude about it?  If you don't like the question delete it
from your inbox.  I have been on this list since the 90's and honestly
I think the answer to every question can be found in the archives or
by using google. When someone asks a question like mine they are
looking for what people know about the subject now.  Why don't you
save your FART comments for the bathroom.  I hope you don't got to VW
shows because you must be pretty lame to hang out with. Everytime time
someone asked about a VW problem you would say FART.  Please in the
future do not respond to any of my email and I will be blocking email
from you.  To those that did give me an answer on this thank you for
your help in keeping my young family safe on the road.
