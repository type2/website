Subject: speed nut size

does anyone know the physical dimensions of the speed nuts used to
hold the front door pulls?  i've checked my local hardware stores and
everything they have is too big.  found an online site that sells all
kinds of speed nuts but i need to know what size to order.  i could
measure the opening in the door panel and on the door but my
conversions from english to metric or not so good.

thanks,

jeremiah
