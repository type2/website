Subject: Re: [T2] [Q] Engine Compartment Insulation

I'm in the same situation and decided to re-use the original insulation 
however I'm putting sound deadening material (the peel-and-stick kind) 
above it (the bottom surface of the metal floor) to reduce vibration.

I haven't decided what kind of material to use to hold the insulation in 
yet.  I could go with something that approximates the original, such as 
1/8" pegboard.  Anyone know why the original retaining board was full of 
holes?  Seems like a solid surface would be better.

If you're talking about putting additional layers of the space-age stuff 
beneath that, I don't see how it could hurt.
