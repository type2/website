Subject: [Q] Fuel Tank Removal

Group-

I'm finally removing my fuel tank for general clean-up, and want to 
hear from someone who's done it before.  My bus is a '71, and the 
good news is that the engine is out (I'm still in restoration 
mode).  I have the cover plate off (i.e. the metal sheet which 
hides/closes the tank.  I've even got the two straps that secure the 
tank removed.

So what's next?

I'm "sure" that there's still gas in the tank.  Should I siphon it 
out from the side of the bus (i.e. filler cap)?  Maybe there's an 
easy way to drain the tank before loosing all the hoses and pullin' 
real hard to get 'er out?

Timely responses are welcome, as I'm trying to do this tonight.
