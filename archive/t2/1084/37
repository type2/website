Subject: KILL THIS THREAD Re: [T2] Tires and age warning

Thanks to Matt's hypocritical reply, this thread is killed.  There is no 
place for such gradeschool trash talking on this list.  If anyone wants 
to call me a list-nazi or other names (and believe me, I could care 
less), do it via p-mail.  If anyone wants to make any kind of comment on 
this post or Matt's post, do NOT post it to the list after 9:55am 
central time.
