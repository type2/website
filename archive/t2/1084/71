Greetings,

I put a rebuilt 2.0l in my '73 Westy and after about 300 miles top highway
speed seems to be about 65mph.  The bus runs great otherwise.  Two major
things I found, #3 and #4 plugs blackish, sooty looking while #1 and #2 nice
brownie brown.  Also while syncing the carbs, after turning off the engine
white smoke was coming out of the left carb (3 and 4 side).

Things I have done, checked valves, set timing, synced carbs.
2.0l hydraulic lifters, SVDA, dual solex 32/34 PDSIT2 left and 32/34 PDSIT3
right (rejetted from 127.5 to 132.5 main to accommodate larger displacement).
I have had the bus for 20 years and my mom bought it in '78 (5 years used) so
PO issues are small.

With those two symptoms I hope some one on the list has a direction to point
me towards.

Thanks,
Tom
