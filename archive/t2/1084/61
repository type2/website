Sorry, the bus is a 1979 Westfalia, with 2.0l fuel injected engine, the points
have been replaced with Pertronix.  I suspected that the pertronix may be bad
except that I get that nice spark coming from the coil.

Except when I pull the center wire off the distributor cap, the one coming
from the coil, I get a could spark the whole time the starter is cranking.

I've checked and all are connected but maybe a terminal is corroded?
