Subject: '73 bug high beams

Hi guys,

 

I don't know who else to ask. I'm trying to get the bug ready to get a
sticker here in MA. When I flip the hi beams the light on the passenger side
goes out. I have changed the sealed beam and changed # 6 & 7 fuses. I don't
know what else to do. Does anyone have any answers? BTW. I don't know it
this is related, but I recently had to pull the steering column apart in
order to change the ignition switch and a small piece of copper fell out. I
saved it just in case. Does this piece of copper have anything to do with
the hi beam failure?

Thanks in advance,

 

Bob
