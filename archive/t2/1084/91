Just so you know, the coil fires when the ground is broken; the coil is 
charging when the points close and voltage is applied.  The time spent 
applying voltage, or charging the coil, is called dwell.


So, what you're looking for is when the pertronix *breaks* the 
connection.  I believe you should be able to remove the wire running 
from the pertronix to the negative side of the coil and hook up a 
continuity tester between that wire and engine ground (touch the 
distributor).  Rotate the crank and when the beeping stops, that means 
the connection to ground has been broken and that is the instant that 
the coil would fire.

Now, I'm somewhat assuming that this would work because it seems 
logical.  If I'm correct, and I'm kinda guessing here, the pertronix 
gets it's power from the positive side of the coil and the distributor 
ground, not from the wire that's going to the negative side of the coil. 
  The wire going to the negative side of the coil is a switched line 
that is constantly getting grounded and broken and grounded and... you 
get the point.  someone please correct me if I'm wrong here...
