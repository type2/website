Subject: re dropping front end

Thanks for the advice.   I have found some info in the library as well.  I 
am wondering how difficult to seperate the beam from the front brackets?  I 
haven't got the manual as yet..It looks like a torsion beam?  Are there 
circlips or something that is under some pressure there?  Hope this is not a 
FART!!!
