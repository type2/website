Nah, VW just needed a bunch of little masonite circles for use on 
another vehicle...

Just kidding. Did successfully recreate these panels from thin masonite. 
Looks OEM. Just traced the old panel onto masonite and cut it out. 
Drilled a bunch of holes in a similar pattern.

I'm going to guess humidity control was the point of the holes. Humidity 
will break down the masonite or cause it to warp.

FWIW I put a heavy rubber OEM cargo mat in the back of my CR-V. Made a 
difference in the noise road noise. Might be worth looking for something 
appealing in looks and function to lay over the engine hump in a VW 
bus... Done right (fitted) I don't think it would need to be fastened or 
glued. Will be going this route with our bus and doing what you guys are 
talking about - some sort of stick on noise blocker on the bottom. Love 
my engine noises but I don't want so much volume.

Have pondered upholstering the walls. Layer of upholstery foam covered 
by something - maybe VW style headline material. Not sure it cuts much 
noise in my Beetle.

Anyone know why VW headliner material has all the little holes? Style? 
Function?
