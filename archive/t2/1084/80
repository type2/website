Hi Bob,

BusDepot is about 480 miles away... Not exactly cost effective to go 
fetch them myself. And even if I was headed through there on my way to 
some VW event or other, I still wouldn't have cargo space for a set of 
4. TireRack also offered similar shipping rates.

Best bet I've found is to replace your tires early in the season. (ie, 
March/April) If you wait until May or June no-one has stock on 185R14s 
in the correct load rating.

Happy Trails,
