Subject: Re: [T2] need help finding a screwdriver bit

A flathead screwdriver is called a blade screwdriver by some folks.

I imagine you've thought of this on your own but it's what came to my  
mind first:  Grind your own tiny bit.  The full size bits are  
available for a dime a dozen.  A few minutes with a grinder and you  
could turn a full size bit into whatever size you desire.

Good luck!
