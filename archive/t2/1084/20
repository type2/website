Does anyone have an opinion on the Vredestein Contrac 205R14?

So far I have only found it at Bus Depot and at $109 apiece they are 
more expensive than the Hankook 195R14's.  I am currently running 
27x8.5-14 tires that are overdue for replacement.  I do not want to run 
a smaller diameter tire like the 195R14 Hankook.  The 205R14 is about 
the same diameter as what I have now which is ideal.  My concern is that 
I can't find any feedback on this tire about longevity, ride quality or 
handling.  I don't want to shell out $500 for inferior tires.

Here is what Bus Depot says about it:

"The Vredestein Comtrac 205R14 Radial is listed as a recommended tire on 
vanagon.com.  It's a higher load rated version of the tire that 
Vredestein supplies to Volkswagen for 2005 German market Passats and 
Jettas. Like the Hankook, it is designed for comfortable highway use 
despite its higher load rating. This tire is marketed as a "summer" 
tire, and while it is comparable in snow/ice to some "all season" tires 
(U.S. standards for calling a tire "all season" are very lax), it is not 
as good in snow/ice as the Hankook. This tire is the same width as the 
stock 205/70R14 tire originally used on Vanagons equipped with alloy 
wheels, but 0.96" taller. (Before ordering, please see the note in the 
gray box to the right on how this may affect your speedometer 
calibration.) This tire is not an optimal choice for Vanagons with steel 
wheels, but is well suited for the slightly wider alloy wheels."

Thanks,

-David
