Go to Tire Rack and look through the sizes and I believe you 
can search by load rating and such.  I bought my Continentals
from them over 5 years ago and have had great service from them.
I can say from the experience of driving 100's of Type 2's over 
the last 30 years........ get tires with reinforced sidewalls (higher
load range) and the handling difference will be well worth the extra 
cost.  Though especially true on campers, even station wagons will
benefit.

Size doesn't matter so much as you might think.  A 195/70 will 
be very similar in diameter to a 185/80.

When do you want to go to Haiti?  I can make it happen.
Christ lays opportunities to serve him at our feet every day.  
We can choose to pick them up or expect that someone else will.
I choose the first.
