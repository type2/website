There is also a handy little program (freeware) called Units Converter 
by Josh
Madison (include his name when you hunt for it). Supposedly used by NASA 
too. For Windows but I think it will run in Linux with Wine.

In Mint Linux KDE there is a free program called "ConvertAll".

I use both in my VW endeavors out in the shop...

Handy when the 'net isn't available to have something that doesn't run 
off of a server.

Wonder if we could save the page and still get the function? I also have 
one on my old Palm Pilot.
