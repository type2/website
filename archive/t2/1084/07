Subject: Re: [T2] [Q] Fuel Tank Removal

The simplest way to drain is to unscrew the fitting at the bottom of the 
tank where the fuel line
connects.  If that is too difficult for some reason just disconnect the 
line.

Other disconnects should be self evident.  I did this a few years ago. 
There are
chemicals to slosh around inside and clean out the tank and then to coat it 
with an impermeable coating inside afterwards.

When reassembling, don't do what I did.  There is a clamp at the base of the 
filler tube that connects to the tank.  I reassembled with the tightening 
screw toward the bottom instead of at the top, pinching the tube slightly at 
the base, enough to let some gasoline out when filling.  I only discovered 
this the first time I stopped for gas.  Had to go home, pull the engine, 
remove the firewall and correct the mistake.

Cheers,

John
