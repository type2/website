Subject: Tar & Feathering, er, Grommeting your firewall

No comment about the tar, but I remember reading back in the Hoover Archives (I think) about building bulkhead pass-thrus for the firewall.  I think it was originally for the fire-starter, er, fuel line, but I did the same for my electrical pass-thrus after finding pretty serious insulation wear where it had rubbed where the grommet used to be.  My first car I got on my own died from an electrical fire and I swore it would never happen again, and busses are, well, known to be self-immolating units on occasion...

What I would do now (at even more of a sacrifice of the wiring harness originality) is build these pass-thrus with the wires embedded in silicone (which is what I did), but use multi-plug ends instead of individual blade-and-socket hookups like I did before.  Wish I still had that Westy - one heck of a mobile apartment!  The passthrus I did were crafted from lamp tubing (the allthread stuff) with the wires embedded inside in silicone, cinched down to the firewall bulkhead and lock-tighted..  Really OCD construction, but I never ever worried about it again.

Yeah - I want my 77 back!

IF you want to stick to grommets, your local FLAPS will have them, as well as your OLDVW Parts. (On Line Dealer... youknow...)

Group-

... P.S.  There are several grommets lining holes in the frame where various
wires/cables pass into the engine compartment.  It would probably be good
to replace these while working on the engine compartment.  Thoughts as to a
good source for these?
