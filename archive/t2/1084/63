Subject: Re: [T2] Head Scratching Spark Problem

I suspect your ignition key is bad when you go from start to run.
Did you try a push start (get 3 friends to get you rolling-ignition on, 
gear in with clutch pedal down, then let pedal up- the rotating engine 
will open the AFM to let the fuel pump run, and you should have spark if 
the ignition + is reaching the + on the coil. If no start, listen in the 
back while someone turns on the ignition- do you hear the double relay 
click?  The coil + should be getting power if you have a voltmeter or 
test light.  Wiggle the key-switch- is it intermittant?  If not the key 
switch is bad. To make it run, run a jumper wire (I have one with 2 
alligator clips on it) from the battery positive to the + on the coil. 
Double relay should click, and turning over engine via starter OR 
pushing should let it start.  If spark but no go, try shorting the fuel 
pump contact to positive or verify fuel pump contacts in AFM are closing 
as flapper opens. Further no run could be no fuel pump running or no 
injectors opening.
