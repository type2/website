Got no pix (sorry), but it was horrifically simple - I suspended the wire bundle in the middle of the "pipe"  and then filled the pipe full of silicone sealant (think I used electrical grade 3m) till it "bulged" a bit around the pipe ends (but not so much it would keep the nuts from going on).  Let it dry and you have your pass thru.

Smoothed out with a (don't laugh, it works) spit-covered finger (tho I'm sure it doesn't impact the guys here, that silicone is death on nails!).  I set these "pass-thru" thingy  up so you plugged the wiring in at either end (so you could remove components, etc) using blade or bullet connectors and the thingy stayed attached to the bus. 

The fuel line one is probably the MOST important one (IMO) to do - the last thing you need is to add to the bus-be-cues of legend by dumping gasoline from your freshly worn-thru fuel line all over that nice, hot exhaust...  

I wish I'd never gotten rid of that bus.  If nothing else I could have done an European 1600 conversion to it (I went thru so many head failures on that miserable 2l, it was crazy!) but I was poor, burned out, and, well, wasn't thinking.  With all the cool goodies (including a forced air swamp cooler replacing one of the jalousie slats made from computer fans - and yes, the window still worked) I realize now I was a fool for bidding it adieu!  Never again!!

I'll look for pix but I fear there are none (that's how PO'd I was at the time)...  I should just get another, eh?

'build these pass-thrus with the wires embedded in silicone (which is what I did)'

That's really interesting.  I am going to have to do some serious custom wiring for my ham radio and stereo systems, dual battery set-up, refrigerator, etc.  But I'm having trouble visualizing what you mean by 'embedded in silicone'.  Do you have a picture of something like that?  I really want to do it right and have it last.  There's nothing worse than chasing an elusive short.  And I'll be re-doing those fuel lines too!  Thanks....KR
