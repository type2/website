Hi Sandra.  Welcome to the list.  When starting a new topic conversation 
it's helpful to compose a new message to the list.  Even if you use a 
fresh subject and reply to an old message it becomes associated with the 
original email thread.

As far as your bumpers go it would be helpful if you could give us your 
approximate location.  I would contact Ken at The Bus Co 
(http://www.thebusco.com/) about used bumpers.

Regards,
