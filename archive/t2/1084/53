Subject: [Q] Engine Firewall Tar & Grommets

Group-

When removing the fuel tank cover (i.e. firewall), I had to pry it loose
from the "tar" holding its lower edge to the bus' structure.  Is this "tar"
standard and necessary?  If so, I guess I need to replace it when
re-installing the fuel tank cover.

-David

P.S.  There are several grommets lining holes in the frame where various
wires/cables pass into the engine compartment.  It would probably be good
to replace these while working on the engine compartment.  Thoughts as to a
good source for these?
