This is a website I stumbled upon using stumbleupon.com of all things hehe.
it's a converter. in the metric MM field you could put your SAE measurment
and hit calculate to get the metric equivelant, and visa versa. good for all
kinds of measurements. Just a handy tool I bookmarked. I would go get the
size off of my bus, but it is at a friends shop currently preparing to have
the body from the floor up cut off. It is destined to be a amphibeous
project :D
