Subject: Re: [T2] [Q] Engine Compartment Insulation

I used an old torn up factory floor mat from a bus for that. It's
trimmed to fit over the engine compartment, and my carpet goes over
that. It makes a huge difference. A very noticeable difference from
just the carpet.

So I did the same thing in the passenger area: Rubber mat, hardboard, carpet.
