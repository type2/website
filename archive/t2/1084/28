Subject: Re: [T2] '73 bug high beams

It's more accurate to say the passenger side high beam doesn't come on 
rather than it goes out.  The high beam you are attempting to light up was 
never on to begin with.

Look for loose or faulty wiring.  Do you have a wiring diagram?  That will 
help.

Cheers,

John
