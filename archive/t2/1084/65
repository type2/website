Sounds like either your distributor cap is bad or your cables are bad. 
I'd change both of them.  An easy test would be to try a different cable 
on #3 and see if it makes a spark.

Maybe as the engine slows down the coil is able to build up a little 
more juice and fire past the problem, but who knows.  Or, maybe the 
distributor cam's worn down for #3.

regardless, I'd try swapping cables.  Heck, even hook up the spark plug 
cable for #3 directly to the coil and then see if it sparks to ground..
