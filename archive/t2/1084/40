Subject: Re: [T2] [Q] Engine Compartment Insulation

David,

I have been pondering the peg-board factor.

Could it be a water trapping issue? I wouldn't necessarily expect
water to gather in the engine compartment (?) but the fact
that the insulation (in the '71) is in individually wrapped bags
speaks to a desire to not coat the entire surface with something, but 
instead to leave a pathway for...i don't know what!  Otherwise, you
would just seal off the area with a single layer of something, right?

Maybe the pegboard was used because it's cheap, allows a pathway for
gasses/moisture to travel, and will be dried out by use of the engine
(in other locations you might not use cheap wood because it's hydroscopic
and will result in mold/rust)?

*shrug*

Pegboard sounds like a good solution.  Plastic mesh (think the grill
on a guitar amplifier) seems better (more durable, easier to work with)...

Dunno.  Thoughts/ideas welcome.

cheers,
	tom
