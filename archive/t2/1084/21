I had these on our '63 Double Cab and they were fine.  I didn't do much in
the way of winter driving, but they did fine in the rain etc.  They were a
bit pricier when we bought them from Discount Tire.  If you have them
pumped up to max, be prepared for a go-cart style ride.  Oh, and these were
195's, not 205's.
