'build these pass-thrus with the wires embedded in silicone (which is 
what I did)'

That's really interesting.  I am going to have to do some serious custom 
wiring for my ham radio and stereo systems, dual battery set-up, 
refrigerator, etc.  But I'm having trouble visualizing what you mean by 
'embedded in silicone'.  Do you have a picture of something like that?  
I really want to do it right and have it last.  There's nothing worse 
than chasing an elusive short.  And I'll be re-doing those fuel lines 
too!  Thanks....KR

> What I would do now (at even more of a sacrifice of the wiring harness originality) is build these pass-thrus with the wires embedded in silicone (which is what I did), but use multi-plug ends instead of individual blade-and-socket hookups like I did before.  Wish I still had that Westy - one heck of a mobile apartment!  The passthrus I did were crafted from lamp tubing (the allthread stuff) with the wires embedded inside in silicone, cinched down to the firewall bulkhead and lock-tighted..  Really OCD construction, but I never ever worried about it again.
