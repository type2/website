Subject: RE: [T2] Head Scratching Spark Problem

 Got the bus to fire up!!  I don't know how I missed it but it seems the only
problem was that the little pickup for the pertronix, the ring that goes on
the distributor shaft was somehow not in the right position.  I found this
after someone suggested connecting the #3 spark plug and wire directly to the
coil and turning the engine.  When I did this I had a great spark.  So
obviously the problem lay in distributor, the cap, or rotor.  I then put a
meter on the negative side of the coil, rotated the engine till the meter
showed 12 volts, meaning the pertronix was saying "fire the plugs".  At this
point I pulled off the distributor cap and low and behold the rotor was
inbetween two of the spark contacts!  So obviously there was not going to be
any firing going on.  I reinstalled the pickup correctly and the bus fired
right up.



I am still puzzled by how this happened since I don't remeber even having the
distributor cap off when I had the engine out but I guess somehow it
happened.



Anyway bus is running, thanks for the advice, it definately "sparked" me in
the right direction.  hahaha
