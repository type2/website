Subject: Engine trouble - jerky at slow revs

Hi All,

Last May I bought a '79 2litre kombi in Northern Germany, pretty stock,
but hand painted over some rough welding. She ran alright for some
months and a lot of miles, but idling was always a bit of an issue, and
she'd stall at lights etc...

Took her on a trip to Spain (ferry to Santander, surfing the N coast
during Basque week celebrations, Biarritz, the Dordogne, Loire), and on
the way back one day she turned into a kangaroo - really bad jumpy
firing, felt like the timing was screwed... we were near Rouen on our
last day before a late ferry; after visiting various local garages we
heard about a specialist air-cooled garage in the North of the city.
Managed to crawl the van there and they saw to her right away. In fact
they were brilliant, worth noting their details in case you're going to
be in that area:

Anyway, the timing was shot, and in their testing they reckoned that
cylinder #3 had low compression... they fixed her up to get her home but
didn't have time to find the root cause of the issue. One of her old
tyres had also bluged out, was egg shaped and was contributing to my
general panic - slapped an old merc wheel on to get her back). She ran
better than ever, and made it home to be put in storage until this
spring (I know thats sad, but she'd be parked on the salty streets of
London all winter, and hasn't got much heating cos new exchangers are
out of budget for now).

Out of storage in May, done a fair bit of mechanical work, but never saw
to the underlying engine issue - not got anywhere to pull the engine and
work on it...

She started slightly jerking/misfiring last week, but was due a tune up,
so off she went to a reputable local garage - carbs, points, plugs,
valves, dweel, timing. Plugs all looked OK, but were a bit gappy.
Mechanic said she drove really well (not the first one to say that). Ran
OK for a few hundred miles, but has started jumping again.

I have read my Tom Wilson and I don't think the piston rings are shot -
while oil consumption is not great, its not bad, and there's no blue
smoke - so I am thinking a burned valve...
Sorry for the long post, but personally I like a bit of a story and
there's a good recommendation up there...

I am moving out of town soon to West Hampshire, and looking for a rental
home with a garage tall enough to slide her in, so I can get to grip
with her properly over the winter...

So the questions:
What do you reckon is wrong - burnt valve sound right?
Problem with the tune up?
Other explanations?
How big/many hours is a valve job for a pro?
Would you leave her parked up for now, then drive her the 70 miles
hopefully to her new home where you could drop the engine and work on
her yourself, or would you not risk it and get her back to the local
garage that did the tune up for full diagnostics and remedial work...?
On a budget....

I love this list - big up to you all!!
