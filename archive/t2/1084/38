Subject: [Q] Engine Compartment Insulation

Group-

As I rework my engine compartment, I am replacing the insulation and
"retaining board" in the compartment's ceiling.  I have some "space-age"
foil insulation left over from insulating my shop's (large metal) door.

I'm guessing that this insulation would be great to use above the engine,
maybe a couple of layers.

Thoughts?

Perhaps I should leave shiny-side down (i.e. facing engine)?
