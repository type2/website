Subject: need help finding a screwdriver bit

Hey everyone,
I have an awesome screwdriver that has proven to be invaluable working 
on everything (including the bus).  This is it:

It's got 6 bits and you can quickly change from one bit to another which 
is super slick.  These are what the bits look like:

Sooo.. one day I was using it and I broke the smallest screwdriver bit - 
it says "1/8 taiwan" on it.  I've called Sears, Craftsman, and every 
other 1-800 number that has anything to do with Sears and nobody has a 
listing for a 1/8" bit.  I've also looked on google and I can't find a 
1/8" in flathead bit anywhere.  It's a really small bit that has been 
really handy (fits the really small flathead screws).

Does anyone have any idea where I can find that 1/8" flathead 
screwdriver bit??

Thanks!
Mike
