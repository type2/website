Subject: to every switch, turn, turn, turn...

today the parents flew back home, the big kid took a nap and the wife 
kept the little kid from chewing on the wires... so i finally got my 
NOS turn signal switch installed!

since the t/s.s i purchased thanks to karl's eagle samba eye turned 
out to be for a 69, i was worried i'd have to cut the long wires that 
connected to the flasher relay, etc.  shame to do that to an NOS 
item!! so i simply taped up the ends, and wiretied the wires 
together, tucked out of the way behind the instrument cluster.

ironically, as i prepared to remove the (presumably original) smoky 
t/s switch, i found... cut wires!!! yes, the switch in the bus had 
either been replaced with a 69 once before, or was so early an 1970 
model that hans at wolfsburg took a perfectly good  switch left over 
from the 69 production run, installed it, and trimmed the superfluous 
wiring. considering the tidiness of the job, i sorta suspect the 
latter.....

i was paranoid that i'd get it all together and STILL have smoke - 
which would mean the e-flasher switch, flasher relay or wire gone bad 
somewhere else - but nothing went blooey when i reconnected the 
battery. turned on the ignition, and everything worked as advertised. 
woo-hoo!

not out of the woods yet; have yet to drive it and not have random 
smoke puffs! but it was a major step in the right direction. extra 
speeshul thanks to king karl, matt r, and the ruptured duck.
