Find a pair of Type 4 heat exchangers (as in 411) and cut the outer tin off. 
This leaves you with essentially a pair of j-tubes...

A stock 72-72 muffler should bolt right up...

OR

You can go crazy like I did. I had it in my head to put a Porsche exhaust 
(with header) on my '77 lowered Bus. Once the j-tubes were installed I 
grabbed the exhaust and attempted to bolt it up.

No way..... the header hit the motor.

But, there was a solution. IIRC, Scott Lyons of Germansupply, cut the 
flanges off the header and welded them on upside down for me and then it 
bolted right up...

Freakin' awesome...

Bus sounded amazing (loud)

Here is a picture after a few months on the road:
