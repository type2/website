For the less than purists that want a permanent repair that won't rust

again, you might consider building up the area with fiberglass mat and resin

I know it makes some people cringe, but believe me, the repair if done

properly is not noticeable, except for the fact it will never rust there a

second time.

Great looking repair, Richard. The 29B panel suits my needs perfectly,

so I'm going to look into it; it would be easier if a U.S. supplier

carried it, and it didn't have to be ordered and shipped individually

from jolly ol' ...
