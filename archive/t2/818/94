This could be all of what the others have said plus
the flex brake line could be bad and holding pressure
on the wheel cylinder, or it could be rust securing
the pad to the drum surface, break loose with a big
hammer, this normally occurs in damp weather.. to make
sure take the brakes apart and grease all the slide
points and the stars checking everything as you go.
