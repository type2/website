I once visited a web site that was dedicated to vacation swaps. Don't
recall it's name now, but it's purpose was free vacationing.

 John, you say, "...the swaps tend to include vehicles..." and I am not sure
 that is necessarily the case.  I guess it's a matter of where you draw the

 the matter of liability in case of accident.  I think that exchanging cars

  certainly it would worry hell out of me.  Probably a better idea is to work
 out reciprocal guest arrangements: A visits B for a week, then B visits A at
 some time later.
