Hi Mark,  You wrote

   "Has anyone on the list used the Schofield windshield repair parts, 
available from Bus Depot, but had to work up an additional bit of sheet 
metal to repair from the edge of the Schofield panel down into the nose 
(1/2 to 3/4 inch or so)..."
          
Are you saying Bus Depot sells repair panels for the rust/rot that develops at 
the bottom of the windshield?  I need some for my 69 Bay!  To answer your 
question:

If the panel is too short, one "should" be able to weld-on an extension.  The 
trick is to make an offset in the extension, so that the upper surfaces remain 
flush.  In other words, you have a lap seam with the overlap toward the inside 
of the Bus.  Tools for making such an offset are generally available... just 
can't recall at the moment, but I would start with autobody tool sites, maybe 
rust panel sites, even try Horrible Freight....  Glenn
