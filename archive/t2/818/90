Mike, are you in England? Just kidding, but that's the only way I can
make sense of your description of the two sensors. The one on the left,
on the head, as you face toward the front of the bus, is a temperature
sensor for the FI system (temperature sensor #2). But unless you're
refering to the flywheel sensor on the other side, the passenger side,
I can't think what this would be.
