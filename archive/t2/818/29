- zero ohm rotor
- different spark plug wires
- new set of plugs are a good idea
- if you had FI/tach you also need an adapter

Bus spark plug wires are made from a carbon conductor coil wire,  
solid copper plug wires and resistor suppressor spark plug  
connectors. The CDI spark is low amperage compared to a normal spark  
and the resistor in the rotor will drain too much of the current in  
the spark so you have to replace the rotor with one that has the  
resistor removed:

The same goes for the resistor connectors at the end of the spark  
plug wires but they are less of a problem than that rotor because the  
stock rotor (no CA ignition) is 5 kohm and the connectors are 1.0-1.4  
kohm. The bus will run with them connector but it would be better to  
remove them.

Mallory states that solid conductor spark plug wires are not to be  
used with CDI. This means you have to use a low resistance "mag- 
wound" wire instead. This advice is for all wires but when I search  
their tech database them seem to indicate that solid wires might be  
ok if the coil wire was a carbon conductor (just like the stock wires  
w/o the resistor connectors on the end). I haven't been able to  
verify it personally but since some people say that you'll burn out  
the stock wires with CDI I thought you should have both pieces of  
advice so you don't accidentally get stranded.

Doesn't matter.

Universal is still in biz but their number has changed: 970-285-1044

Hoover said the part number was 73XX4959N but I don't know if that's  
valid anymore.
