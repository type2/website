77, 2.0L, FI - Stock exhaust setup
 
While adjusting my valves today I noticed a crack in the muffler about 1
& 1/2 inches long. Perhaps thats why it has been so loud lately.

It looks like an X.  Must have been an impact of some sort.
 
Anyway....what kind of mufflers do you guys & gals use? 
Any specifics out there? Maybe what to look for/stay away from.

Id really like to switch to an earlier bay style exhaust system, without
the J-Tube manifolds, but I dont think the checkbook can handle it right
now. 

Thanks. 

BTW, the valve adjustment went fine, and the engine sounds great!
