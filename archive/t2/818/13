Subject: Re: [T2] Stainless Steel Exhaust

If you want the "j-tube" option, we have a pair of 411 heat exchangers (I
believe) on my girlfriend's bus. They are earmarked for replacement anyway,
because I want good heat and will replace them with 72-74 heat exchangers.
P-mail if you want them - they are not SS, but they will fit.

Ahnendorp makes nice all SS systems, but those are not cheap. However,
consider finding a good 72-74 NOS Leistritz or VW muffler (not impossible,
they were used in Europe up to 83 or so). My last Leistritz went on used
(unknown prior mileage) and lasted about 50K miles - and that included both
salted German roads in winter and East Coast climate.

Find a pair of Type 4 heat exchangers (as in 411) and cut the outer tin off.

This leaves you with essentially a pair of j-tubes...

A stock 72-72 muffler should bolt right up...
