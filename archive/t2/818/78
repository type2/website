The biggest problem with using CNG as I understand it is the large 
quantities you need to store to have any sort of range. Propane (or LPG as 
we call it in Australia) is far more practical as a vehicle fuel. You still 
have the problem of where to put the tank, but it's a smaller tank. You 
also need a means of heating the gas. This lot in the UK use the exhaust: 
www.gasure.co.uk I have heard of oil being used as well.
