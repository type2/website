Subject: vent window assembly

What is the best way to get the glass back in the vent window frame?  I am
totally rebuilding my vent windows and am ready to put the glass back in the
chrome frame.  I have the vent window lock installed and am trying to get
the glass in the frame but I am wondering if there are any tricks to doing
this?  Thanks.
