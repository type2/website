Subject: Re: [T2] oil cooler

Scott,
You have my interest, but I am concerned about clearance issues with the 
sandwich adapters. I don't know if they fit once the hose fittings are on. 
Last time I changed my filter I had a long look up there and things are 
pretty tight around the top of the filter. That's why I am putting the 
question to the list though. I hope to get as much info as possible so I can 
make an informed decision. Please do take a look at the adapter and let me 
know what you think.
