Subject: Nose/windshield repair

Has anyone on the list used the Schofield windshield repair parts, 
available from Bus Depot, but had to work up an additional bit of sheet 
metal to repair from the edge of the Schofield panel down into the nose 
(1/2 to 3/4 inch or so)? If so, I would be interested in learning how 
you went about it.
