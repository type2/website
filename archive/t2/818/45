Subject: Miami International Auto Show

Hey guys,

    Thought you would get a kick out of this. I went to the International Auto
Show last night in Miami, and when you first walk into the enterance, they had
some people passing out bags (with which to put your car catalogs and stuff
in). These bags were from Progressive Insurance. They had three kinds, one had
a Porsche on it, one had an old 70s American car (not a muscle car, just more
of a beater), and then the third one was a Volkswagen Bus. It was painted up
with peace symbols, smiley faces, and whatnot. It was a real picture of a real
Bus. It was definitely a Bay Bus, but it had the more curved rear upper
quarter air intlet pipes so I assume it was a Pre 72?.

If anyone cares enough, I can take a quick picture of it and e-mail it.
