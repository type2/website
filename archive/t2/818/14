Subject: How to tell when the heat riser is unplugged

Hi all,



I am cleaning some final parts before engine assembly. I turned my
attention to the heat risers on my 1600dp manifold and knocked lots and
lots of carbon out. How do I tell if it is unplugged though? I blow into
it but I cannot really determine if it is unplugged or not. Should I be
able to put a piece of wire in one end and take it out the other? If no,
then where should I try to feel air coming out? I checked the archives
but could only find that people successfully unplugged them and their
methods, not how they knew it was unplugged.



Thanks for the help,



Max
