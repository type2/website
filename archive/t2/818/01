Subject: Selling my Bus

After much deliberation, we have decided we have outgrown our Bus.

We even have a side tent and a new Espar Gas heater.

It is a 1978 Westphalia Campmobile CDN.

I am ready to negotiate the sale personally with interested purchasers. I will send pictures to and information.

I rust check it even though it never sees the salt road.
