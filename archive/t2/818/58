Then why did my mileage improve after I replaced my perfect working
vacuum advance setup?
Then why did my engine temp remain exactly
the same? 

Nice thing about using the 009 is there are parts in every corner of America
and since the Comp-U-Fire adds no moving parts and actually eliminates a
coil wire and point and rotor, it makes it even more reliable.

When they fail, the techs say that most C.U.F. failures that come back to
the factory are due to user installation errors or cross-connecting during a
back-yard tune-up.

BTW you can use the Comp-U-Fire with
most VW dizzys as long as the cap is the same size.

All I know is that these systems have worked great for me and I don't drive
my Truck with a feather foot. Everybody I know that runs them love them and
my local VW shop swears by them.
