Phil,
It sound like you have used these sandwich adapter plates. I'm curious about 
clearance for the hose fittings on the bus engine. Do you use a 90 degree 
fitting to point the hoses straight down? What do you consider as the best 
route to get the hoses to the cooler using one of these adapters?
