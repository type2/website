Dave,
I used emery cloth. Scaping inside the caliper and on the piston in circles
perpendicular to piston's movement in caliper. It is the rubber seal that
make the caliper/piston seal, not the inside wall of the caliper.

The caliper was rebuilt on 07/2005 and it has been leak free since then.

This is my method only, maybe it is an heresy.. No warranty blah blah
