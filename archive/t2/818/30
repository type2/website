If you have the triangle flange heat exchangers from the 75-78 US  
models then you can get a 1-piece aftermarket system for about $100  
that sounds quiet and bolts straight to the heat exchangers:

Bus Depot 352000 (US made)
BugPack 2085
Bus Boys 210-25006/BP (BugPack)
CIP1 VWC-071-251-053-PS

Some of them have EGR ports, some don't. This is what it sounds like:
