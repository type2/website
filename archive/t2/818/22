Subject: Rotisserie Website

Folks,

I had an overwhelming response to post the pics of the rotisserie I helped 
build for a '59.

So, I built this crude gallery of pics for all to see.
Excuse my messy garage and I am the one with NO hat on....

You will notice the Travis (the owner of the bus) sandblasted the entire 
vehicle.

Get this, he did it with a fire hose and one of those HUGE industrial diesel 
generators...what a site!!

You will also see a play by play of a bus flipping 180 in my garage, with only 
two people...

I CANT TAKE CREDIT FOR THE ROTISSERIE, it was designed and built by Travis Doll 
of Whitby, ON and I was just his apprentice...
