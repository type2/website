Subject: Re: [T2] Alternator light on.

<<For the last few days, the alternator light has come on when my RPMs
are low. Last night I also noticed that it alternates with the turn
signal light when I have the headlights on. 
Is this a sign of an impending alternator failure? >>

I don't know how much more impending you can get Gary, other than it
jumping outa he Bus and slapping you in the          forehead.
Yea, I'd say it's going hasta Lavista, baby.
