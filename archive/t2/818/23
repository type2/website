Subject: Re: [T2] Just a thought about holidays

Regarding house & vehicle exchanges - I think it would be a great idea,
but the hangups tend to be with insurance issues, and the fact that not
everyone is as honest/respectful/responsible/clean/etc as you or I may be.
I agree that it might be better to do a host thing, as mentioned, where A
visits B for a week, then later B visits A for a week...and certainly it
could be marketed towards bus owners.
 As an aside, I've had many a travelling busser stay at my house or yard
for a night or two while passing through, and have always enjoyed meeting
and hanging out with them...
