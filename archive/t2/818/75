Subject: Convert Gasoline to Natural Gas?

Hey Matt,
           I am not sure CNG does much if anything for the greenhouse gas 
problem.  The engine runs less efficiently, from a thermodynamic standpoint, 
and that means more thermal 'pollution' as a result of using it under the same 
driving conditions.  With upcoming shortages of natural gas, I doubt that you 
would realize any $$$ savings either.

Here in the states, the government conducts auctions of its surplus vehicles.  
A few years ago they were conducting tests of CNG; meaning that now a number 
of CNG vehicles come up for auction.... and they go cheap.  I would like to 
learn about converting CNG to gasoline, and take advantage of the deals.  
Google 'GSA auto auctions' and see if there isn't one convenient to your home 
in Canada, if you live near the border.  They take credit cards like Amex and 
Viza, FYI.  Glenn

I just bought a 76 Type2 ... for recreational use. I'm feeling rather
guilty about increasing greenhouse gasses ... so maybe I can convert
this baby to Natural Gas??  Can anyone direct me to some good online
resources for this? Or speak of their own knowledge...
