Comp-U-Fire distributorless ignition for your 009 is what the doctor
ordered, IMHO. I have put thousands of trouble-free miles and have a tidy
engine compartment to boot. You can even open up your gap on your plugs to
.050 to get a better spark and better mileage. The performance improvements
are remarkable and the 009's "flat-spot" disappears.
