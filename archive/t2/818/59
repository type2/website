perhaps your "perfectly working" vacuum setup was not perfectly working
after all. ;-)

I have made this offer before; I'll wager $1000 to anyone that wants to bet
their 009 vs my vacuum , best 2 out of 3

engine temps (oil or head, your choice)
mpg
drivability

provided the carb(s) are SVDA compatible.

the 009 will allow an engine to run, but not even close to "run well". Most
folks that think a 009 is running well have not compared it to anything.
