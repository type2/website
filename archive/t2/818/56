When I worked at a VW shop, many of the Compu-Fire "distributorless"
electronic ignition units that we had installed failed. The part that kept
failing was the four-coil "Custom Coil Pack," not the Hall-effect electronic
module and magnetic trigger rotor, which were practically bullet-proof.

The Pertronix Ignitor was also extremely reliable.

Both the Pertronix and the Compu-Fire points replacement modules produce high
voltage spark reliably when used with a standard cylindrical coil, such as
the Bosch blue coil (the good version) or the Pertronix Flame Thrower coil.

I've been running a Pertronix Ignitor I in my '79 bus for ten years now, with
no problems. The bus has the stock Bosch 0231 168 005 distributor. I did have
to replace the stock coil four years ago when its spark had deteriorated to an
anemic orange. It ran perfectly again with a Bosch blue coil and it now runs
even a little better since I installed a Pertronix 40511 Flame Thrower 3.0 ohm
coil. The plugs are gapped at .040 inches.

Comp-U-Fire distributorless ignition for your 009 is what the doctor
ordered, IMHO. I have put thousands of trouble-free miles and have a tidy
engine compartment to boot. You can even open up your gap on your plugs to
.050 to get a better spark and better mileage. The performance improvements
are remarkable and the 009's "flat-spot" disappears.
