Well, I'm pretty much sold on the CDI, but I need to get the puchase 
approval from my S.O.  I'm just trying to figure out

1.  What are all of the parts I will need
2.  Which distributor should I use.

The engine is otherwise stock (well, it has a free flow exhaust but 
I'm not sure how long that's going to last) and I don't plan any 
performance enhancements (carbs, cams, etc).

As far as the Universal Corp. CDI, the Mallory is pretty much the 
same price (-at-) aircooled.net.  It appears to be a newer version, but 
I'm not sure exactly when they started production.
