From Jon Stiles:

 Comp-U-Fire distributorless ignition for your 009 is what the doctor
ordered, IMHO. I have put thousands of trouble-free miles and have a tidy engine compartment to boot. You can
even open up your gap on your plugs to .050 to get a better spark and better mileage. The performance
improvements are remarkable and the 009's "flat-spot" disappears.

Sorry, but that is FALSE advertising!   You are still using the 009 dist for the trigger signal.  To be truly
'distributorless' you need a crank sensor.
