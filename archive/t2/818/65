Subject: Convert Gasoline to Natural Gas?

I just bought a 76 Type2 ... for recreational use. I'm feeling rather
guilty about increasing greenhouse gasses ... so maybe I can convert
this baby to Natural Gas??  Can anyone direct me to some good online
resources for this? Or speak of their own knowledge on how feasible this
is?
 
Thanks folks!
Matt
