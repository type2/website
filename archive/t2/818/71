This is a post for anyone who missed the Rotisserie thread over the weekend.

I have a slow ISP connection, and normally get impatient; even with my wife 
calling for dinner I was fascinated, watching as the screen filled from

Let's give a BIG round of applause to Collie for making the images available to 
us!  Goes without saying, I highly recommend clicking on the link...

.....overwhelming response to post the pics of the rotisserie I helped build 
for a '59.  So, I built this crude gallery of pics for all to see.  Excuse my 
messy garage and I am the one with NO hat on....

You will notice Travis (the owner of the bus) sandblasted the entire 
vehicle... Get this, he did it with a fire hose and one of those HUGE 
industrial diesel generators...what a sight!!

..I CANT TAKE CREDIT FOR THE ROTISSERIE, it was designed and built by Travis 
Doll of Whitby, ON and I was just his apprentice...  Collie
