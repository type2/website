Richard, that page of sounds is terrific!

Having said that, I am going to make a request. I'm having a little 
trouble hearing the differences distinctly. (Too many Friday nights in 
front of Marshall stacks? Maybe.) Is there any way to post a snapshot 
of each waveforms along with MP3? Sometimes I can hear better when I 
can see what I'm listening for.
