Subject: 73-79 phatty bus nose for sale

 anybody want to buy a 73-79 bus nose? it is red, off a 75 transporter,
in mint condition. no dings, nor rust, perfect sill. it is cut about 12-14
inches back from the top of the windshield [into the roof], and about the
same distance of floor is left - cut just in front of the seat pedistal. in
eugene, but may deliver to the bay area in late december. photos and pricing
via p-mail. i'm not going to use it, esp since i am selling my 75 westy
soon. - steve
