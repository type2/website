On both my '78 and my '76 buses, my rear brakes (one side only) tend to LOCK 
up when I leave my emergency brake on, even for just 45 minutes.

The shoes are 'brand new' on the '78, and 'like new' on the '76.

This only started in June this year on the '78, and I have been driving the 
'78 for the past 12 years about 100,000 miles.

This has started in the past few months for the '76, and I have been driving 
the '76 for 18 months, about 1,500 miles.

When the '78 locked up for the first time in June, it was sitting in the 
Florida wet rainy days for 3 days, and I could not move the '78. I had to 
get under and adjust the brake star on the one wheel before it would break 
free.

The '76 locked up this past Sunday at church, but it broke free OK. It has 
been locking up more frequently than the '78 because the '78 is my daily 
driver.

I thought it might be wet weather (from Florida) expanding my shoe lining, 
but the weather lately in Virginia has been uneventfully pleasant.


Why are the rear brake(s) locking up on me??

Serious question.
