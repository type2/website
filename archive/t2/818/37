Subject: Re: [T2] Alternator light on.

i got a new well rebuilt alternator and mine still does that sooooooo? does that mean mine is fixing to go out again..?cause it does this as gary is talking about as well?
 
only at night when the lights are on bright or when i use turn signals does it do this not sure if same for gary but sounds like it...?
not bright just dim enough to make you grow a few more worry wrinkles...?
peace

Is this a sign of an impending alternator failure? >>
