I can see your point.  I would be very leery of tackling roads so unlike
the ones I am used to while trying to remember to drive on the other side
of the road and shift with my left hand.  I think that the same would
apply to someone from the UK coming to the US.  My sister in law has lived
in the UK for a decade and it takes her quite a while to readapt to SoCal
freeways and LHD cars when she comes to visit.

I think that the idea of exchanging visits with other bus folks would be
better, safer, cheaper, and more enjoyable.  Having a "native guide" to
show you about would be pretty nice!
