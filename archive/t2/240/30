Subject: wiring routes and plug type

Hi All-

I am starting the process of installing VDO gauges in my 1971 Westy, 1600 dp
bone stock. I will be installing oil pressure, oil temperature and cylinder
head temperature.

-Because I'll be using a sensor under the #3 plug for CHT, I think I should
go to a longer plug to offset the added washer. Does anybody have a
recommendation to what I can use or am I being too anal?

-Does anybody have any tricks or secrets in wiring routes or electrical
hookups, particularly for instrument lighting?

Thanks in advance for your help-

Pete
