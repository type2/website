Not to get into a manual quoting exercise here, but I believe the important
thing to note is that the quality of multi-grade oils is vastly improved in
the almost 30 years that have elapsed since the 1974 manual was written.

From the 1979 Bentley: VW Official Service Manual:

"It might seem that a high viscosity oil is all that is necessary to
properly lubricate an engine. Unfortunately, this is not true. If a high
viscosity oil is used during cold weather, it will become so thick and
resistant to flow that it cannot properly circulate and reach the parts of
the engine requiring lubrication. A thick high viscosity oil also will
become so gummy in cold weather that the starter cannot turn the engine fast
enough to start it. The proper viscosity oil will remain fluid enough after
the engine has cooled to permit easy starting, yet after the engine has
reached operating temperature, will retain sufficient viscosity to maintain
an adequate lubricating film.

"Single-grade engine oils, such as SAE 30, were formerly recommended for use
in VW engines because of the unreliable quality of the then available
multi-grade engine oils. The new high standard for engine oils that conform
to the API (American Petroleum Institute) service rating API/SE has made
such oils suitable for use in the VW engine. Car owners will find that these
high-quality multigrade oils offer many advantages in convenience,
performance, and economy--even in older model VWs."

Since 1979 there continue to be improvements, especially synthetics. Oils
have gone from an SE to an SF and now to an SG standard.

So I would not get hung up on what a 1974 manual says, given today's
improved multigrade oils.
