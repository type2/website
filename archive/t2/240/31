at the motorworks show i was talking with one of the vendors on seat 
redoing.  she said that for several  of their setups they actually use 
both.  They use the original vw seat pad and then put a thin foam one on 
top of that.  Another  bus driver  at the show said that was how the 
shop in castlerock that did his did it also.
