<<The VW's oiling system is based on pressure, NOT TEMPERATURE. if you
run a too-heavy oil in there, pressure will be fantastic, but the engine
will "think" the oil is too cold and will bypass the oil cooler. Guess
what happens to your oil temps?>> 

Really?
 
So when your blasting down the asphalt ribbon at 65 mph, on a 100 degree
day into a headwind laboring the engine, there isn't any thermal
breakdown of the viscosity ?
Your 15 /50 is more than likely 10/40 at that point.
Any pressurized oiling system will go to by pass when the engine is
really cold regardless what king of oil you running---

<<After all, if you run 0 clearance on your bearings, the oil pressure
will be incredible, until the journal burns from overheating (oil
removes the heat too, it's not just a lubricant).>>

If your engine was running 0 clearance on all of the bearing surfaces it
wouldn't turn over---
 
<<Most (not all) VW owners are ignorant about the way the VW engine
TRULY operates, and if someone tells you to run straight weights, they
better have a real good reason.>>

Funny thing---
on page 52 of my 1974 VW owner's manual is mentions;

Tropical Climate---

Hot season--SAE 40

Cool season--SAE 30

Moderate Climate--

Summer--SAE 30

Winter-above 5 degree--SAE 20w 20

At average outside temps not lower than -13 degree's---SAE 10

<<The FACTORY recommends multigrade's-->>

I must have been reading a Citron owner's manual here----or somehow the
factory owner's manual I have must be a           misprint.

ALL (not some) air cooled industrial engine malefactors insist on
straight weight oils for maximum engine longevity----
Why?
Because air cooled engines inherently run much hotter than liquid
cooled, and the thermal breakdown  and the drop of viscosity at high
temps short live the engines-- 
This is a known and accepted fact of life.

Same with air cooled bike engines--they run HOT and benifit from the
vicosity holding benifits of straight weight oil.


Multi grade oils were developed for Joe Q. Average who is too lazy to
swap to a different weight for temperature differences, and was finding
that his engine with the 40 weight in it wouldn't spin at -20
degree's--because he forgot to change the oil.

It's a convenience that's all-
