Mike:]

Terminal grease is really non-conductive; certifed to
be so actually. (imagine if you get it across the two
terminals it would be a disaster, especially on digital
electronics).  But it is compatible to all the common
materials used in the connectors without corroding
them. (Tin, copper, brass, gold, etc) The connectors
make connection through the grease.  this is like
covering your battery terminals with vaseline to
prevent corrosion.
