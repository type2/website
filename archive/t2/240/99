Subject: dipstick for 1600

I have a '71 van - 1600 dp - AE engine block. 

Bentley + Muir both say the engine takes 2.5 litres of oil. Mine reads
nowhere close to full when I put 2.5 litres in. 

Is it possible I have the wrong dipstick? I don't want to blow out the new
main seal I just put in. It does not have a deep sump or an oil filter.
How would I check whether or not the dipstick is correct? The engine was
rebuilt from the bottom up by the PO and I am not entirely sure of the
internals. 

thanks
dc
