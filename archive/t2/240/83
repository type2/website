Subject: '80 Westy manuals

I just picked up, in decent shape,
1)'80 Vagon Manual,
2)'80 Campmobile supplement,
3) owners manual (like, just a single folded sheet) for the 'range counter 
unit',
4) one page PRODUCT INFORMAYION - Two Stage L.P. Gas Regulation (Marshall 
Brass)


A friend in Northern VA NEEDS an engine door (outside) for his Sage Green 
'78 Westy

Anyone going to Manassas this weekend that can help on the engine door??


BTW, there is an '80 Westy in the yards with good looking refrig/stove 
combo.  Also, most of the curtains, including the front curtain, decent rear 
seats, ratty front seats, decent canvas,

Gotta go
