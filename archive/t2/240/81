Hello list, here are a few questions for you,

I am missing the brake shoe retaining clips in the rear drums on my '77 bus.
When I went to install new ones I found I have no hole in the backing plate
for them?? I thought all shoes had these clips, even the Bentley shows them.
Should I drill holes and install them?
Also I was sold new brake shoes for a '80-'88 Vanagon. They look the same.
Does that sound right?

I also am installing new heater cables. What is better, to try and grease
them, or just run some oil through the cables?

Lastly I have the dreaded push rod tube oil leak (type 4 motor). I replaced
the o'rings (I used viton ones) about 4 months ago and thoroughly cleaned,
checked and prepared both the tubes and sealing surfaces. It started weeping
~3 weeks after fixing and has slowly gotten worse. Is there anything else I
can do to stop the leak???

Thanks for all your help.
