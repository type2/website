Where I live there is only about 12 busses, and four
are the same as mine; "tan" 78 westy.  All the others
are beautiful, mine has through body rust.

We wave all the time, but I have no idea how these
people are:

Next time I see one parked I will wait and see how they
are...


By the way I had a new beetle driver wave to me a few
weeks ago,...I waved back and gave her a big smile!
