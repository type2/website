I've been reading along on this and I don't find Doyt's costs way out of
line.  Price would be extremely local; more in NY, less in NC, no idea in
CA.

At the same time, consider this thought experiment.  Say you decide that
the car of your dreams is a showroom fresh 1978 deluxe Westfalia with
tent.  I seriously believe that if you set your budget at the $40,000 that
a new EV camper would cost you that you could have TWO of your dream
vehicle and still have money left over.  I do not believe that it is
possible to spend $20K on restoring a VW bus  (OK, it is possible...
*anything* is possible :-)

I think there should be three budget levels.  First, there is the "running
safe bus" level which can usually be achieved, with some shopping around
and repairs after purchase for $3-5k.  Second, there is the "nicely
restored bus" which will set you back at least $5K and may run up to
$10-12K.  Then there is the "showroom bus".  I believe that this would be
possible, but that the budget should be set at the budget for a new
minivan, i.e. $20K.
