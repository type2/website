Here we go again.

" So when your blasting down the asphalt ribbon at 65 mph, on a 100 degree
 day into a headwind laboring the engine, there isn't any thermal
 breakdown of the viscosity ?"

do you change your oil every 15k miles?

"After all, if you run 0 clearance on your bearings, the oil pressure
 will be incredible, until the journal burns from overheating (oil
 removes the heat too, it's not just a lubricant).>>

 If your engine was running 0 clearance on all of the bearing surfaces it
 wouldn't turn over---"

OK, .0005". I was making a point, which you obviously missed.

> Funny thing---

* When was this owners manual ACTUALLY WRITTEN?
which is why I mentioned the FACTORY RECOMMENDATION for lubricants in the
2002 aircooled cars. You can continue to use your dog-eared 1974 glovebox
guide for technical arguments, and ignore the factory UPDATED recommedation
and technical bulletin updates.
