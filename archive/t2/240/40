Subject: [t2]HOW DO I GET UNDER SWIVEL SEAT IN VANAGON

Hi everyone,
Finally trying to play with some of the camping equipment on my 80 westy and can not figure out how to get under the drivers seat (swivel base) to see if I'm wired up for a second battery or what there are a few wires that go there but can tell what they do. If I spin the base or I still cant open it. Also should there be a switch to turn on fridge and where would it be.  It is an electric fridge only. Also does anybody even think there worth getting running I've heard they don't get very cold  but it sure would make the girl friend happy if it worked.   
While I'm here I'm also planning a move to the boulder CO area within the next year and wondering on there emissions rules my egr filter and probably not the egr valve are hooked up would  this be a problem. I know I will need to get the correct exhaust with a cat.  I also fiberglassed 2 holes about the size of a half dollar in the upper wheel well don't know if that would be a problem as well going to under coat it so it should not be noticable anyway.  Vt is not very picky just needs to have all the lights work and insurance.  Just need some projects for the weekend.
Thanks in advance
Kevin
