When am I not! ;) I hope you took my comments in the light hearted

I will have to look into the Golden Spectro some more. It is not one of 
the synthetics that came onto my radar screen when I was looking at such 
things. It's too bad they didn't test that one as well as the Mobil-1. I 
would love to see a real head to head comparison.

If your engine has issues with running hot, I would agree with you. 
However, if you have enough oil cooling going on for the engine and 
ambient temperature then why should it make a difference. I certainly 
think that the synthetic 15-50 is too thin at temperatures of 250 F and 
above. However, with an extra oil cooler my oil temps don't go over 230 
even on the highway in 104 F heat! So if the oil never goes up to the 
point where a multi-viscosity thins too much then what advantage do you 
have running straight weight dyno over synthetic?

If somebody made a straight 30 or 40 weight synthetic I would switch to 
that for sure. Doesn't exist now, so I will stick with mutli-vistcosity 
synthetic, and keep it cool enough that it doesn't thin too much.
