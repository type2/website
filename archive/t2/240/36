Subject: 1979 VW van 

I'm selling one of my 1979 VW campers . It's been a while since I last
posted but I had to rebuild all my files on my Harddrive . The Van is a 2.0L
, poptop , automatic  . I have replaced the front brakes , new tires , new
alternator and voltage regulator , new transmission filter and pan gasket ,
new alt belt , but the motor leaks oil and I have no more time to work on it
. The motor runs strong , and the transmission is even stronger . I live in
Atlanta Ga . . the price is $900.00 .
