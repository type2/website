Subject: Re: [T2] Synthetics, and air cooled engines

Back a while when this oil string started again I actually pulled out 
the manuals for 65 bug, 74 bug, 82 vanagon, 84 jetta, 91 jetta.
the same oil chart is in every one of them with the only differences 
being that you see multigrades and synthetics coming in.  I then took a 
couple of old ford user manuals  a fiesta and another one.  their charts 
were the same with only change being that synthetics moved in.  The 
point here is exactly as you stated.  technology changes.  takes a few 
years to get accepted by the OEM people, and then they accept it and put 
it in their charts.  Some of it is the "old  dog theorum."  However this 
old  dog that has been using heavy oil in summer and synth in winter is 
going to switch over to all synth after some oil pressure problems noted 
on a t4 engine (too high)
BTW if you looked at that article close you would note that it is not a 
new article.  People that are around the stuff daily can probably give 
you a date from those prices and it is not recent.
