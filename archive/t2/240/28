Oh Boy---

0 clearance stated--zero clearance understood.
If you wanted me to think .0005 why didn't you write that?

Finger slip on the keyboard?---:>)

That mut have been the point--you missed the right key.

Please tell me what automoblie is VW manufacturing in 2002 that is air
cooled?

Hmm---maybe I'll have to down the street, and check out the lot at
VW--perhaps I missed a new model.

And---according to more than one VW wrench----(Krauts, rockheaded, 35
years with VW) " dis multi grade stuff is sheist, run straight weight
oil, dey last longer"

What do they know--they only work there.

However as a footnote to their comments, they did mention that if in
fact a guy couldn't locate straight weight oils of good quality--use
20/50 Castrol GTX--this is the next best thing.

They wouldn't even discuss syn oils.

I dump my syn oil in my air cooled Bus every 2.5k--overkill
In my Vanagon's--every 3k---Castrol 50w summer--30w winter( with a quart
of Marvel all the time )

OK--your turn.

Here we go again. 
<<The VW's oiling system is based on pressure, NOT TEMPERATURE. if you
run a too-heavy oil in there, pressure will be fantastic, but the engine
will "think" the oil is too cold and will bypass the oil cooler. Guess
what happens to your oil temps?>> 
Really? 
So when your blasting down the asphalt ribbon at 65 mph, on a 100 degree
day into a headwind laboring the engine, there isn't any thermal
breakdown of the viscosity ? 
do you change your oil every 15k miles? 
<<After all, if you run 0 clearance on your bearings, the oil pressure
will be incredible, until the journal burns from overheating (oil
removes the heat too, it's not just a lubricant).>> 
If your engine was running 0 clearance on all of the bearing surfaces it
wouldn't turn over--- 
OK, .0005". I was making a point, which you obviously missed. 
Funny thing--- 
on page 52 of my 1974 VW owner's manual is mentions; 
* When was this owners manual ACTUALLY WRITTEN? which is why I mentioned
the FACTORY RECOMMENDATION for lubricants in the 2002 aircooled cars.
