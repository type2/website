Bracket?  It should be a spring steel piece that looks like a safety pin. It
was the same from 64 to 79. From the bolt end on the lid to the clip holding
it together on the bottom end, it is 10" long. Only difference that changed
over the years were the rollers on the body. Early used 2 metal rollers, late
bay used a nylon block.
Go here, it will be #3.
