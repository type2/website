Subject: Re: [T2] [t2]HOW DO I GET UNDER SWIVEL SEAT IN VANAGON

[...]
rules in boulder are emissions check and they do look to see if 
everything is hooked up from below for sure but they didnt have me pop 
the hatch.  The fridge in that one should be a 3way 12v, 110, and 
lpgas.  the only fridge i know of that was put in the 80 to 85 was the 
rm182b dometic.  to get under the drivers seat you may need to actually 
slide the seat off of the base (flip latches and slide forward until it 
drops off) and then swivel the base around.  the steering wheel has a 
bad habit of getting in the way when trying to swivel the seat itself 
around. they dont inspect holes here. insurance required.  The wiring 
for the second battery would consist of a connector and a small relay 
under the seat.  a group 41 or group 42 battery will fit in the hole 
just like on the pax side.  as for wires  under the seat. if you are not 
aux battery configured (very few actually were i found  out) the two 
wire running under the seat run to the fridge.  one is the d+ trigger 
for the relay to turn of if engine is not running and the other is the 
12v main to the kitchen area.  the water pump will run with engine off 
but the fridge will not.  It is easy to reconfigure it for the dual 
battery.
