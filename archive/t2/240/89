They are different. The split was end of 71/start of 72.

72 and up is longer. From screw hole to screw hole, it is 142mm.
Part # 211 943 131D, has SAE L71 on it.

Up to the end of 71, it is shorter. From screw hole to screw hole, it is
130mm. Part # 211 943 131C, has a pre-70 number after SAE.

A lot of conflicting info here......
All the literature I have shows only one interior light in a bus.....
The 68-72 parts book says:
211 947 111 up to chassis # 218 220 000 [end of 68] and
271 947 111A from chassis # 219 000 001 [start of 69].
Ekta says:
211 947 111B up to # 215 2300 000 [end of 75] and
823 847 105B from # 216 2000 001 [start of 76].
4 different part numbers!!!

Both show a switch in front, part # 111 955 511B that was used from 68 to the
end of 74 [214 2300 000].
I know the front one has door jamb switches and a 3 position switch on the
light [door open on/off/on].

The dash switch listed above has to be for the rear light. To turn it on from
the front. I believe the rear light would need a 2 position switch on it for
the people in the back......
But this raises a question.... on my 67, I have a switch for the rear dome
light on the left side of the speedo pod. It turns the power on and off to the
rear dome light. If I have it on, then the rear dome switch will turn the
light on and off. If I have it off, the rear dome switch is dead and the light
stays off.
Does the 68-74 work this way also?  Or is it wired like a 3-way house light
circuit??  Inquiring minds want to know:)
