Subject: Re: [T2] Synthetics, and air cooled engines

Excuse me,

I thought this thread was about oils and air cooled engines, not buying new 
cars or where they are available. The fact is that VW is still building 
air-cooled cars and oil technology is constantly changing. Air-cooled 
technology is not standing stil, either. Check out what Tatra is building 
at:

http://www.tatra.cz/enff/konception/motor/

Where the cars are built or sold should not be a factor. I don't believe VW 
ever produced air-cooled cars in this country. However, there is a well 
known motorcycle company in the US that is about to celebrate 100 years of 
building air-cooled products.

I don't wish to continue in this thread as everyone has their own opinion on 
oil and I'm not about to try to convince anyone to switch oils.

I'll take the "wild man" bit as a compliment.

Thank you,
