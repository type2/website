Normal.  The input shaft is on splines inside the transmission and has a
bit of play.

I tend to think that "when in doubt, replace the disk."  I probably
replace them too often, but I've never worn one out and had to pull the
engine to replace it.  When installing the pressure plate, a
mini-mag-light flashlight makes a perfect pilot tool.

Works for me.  If the clutch was smooth before the pilot bearing problem
then the surfaces are probably fine.
