Subject: engine lid bracket

Does anyone have a ruler they could measure the bracket on the engine lid, we 
are restoring a 1972 and I put the bracket on it which I thought was from 
when we pulled it apart but the lid on the open psoition hits the rear door 
and on closing the arm hits the engine compartment on its way down, please 
help thanks Dylan
