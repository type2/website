Terry-

Maybe I misunderstood you here. This article seems to inducate that,
compared to automotive oils, motorcycle oil doesn't even work very well in a
motorcycle. It does make a good case for choosing synthetics over mineral
based oils, but I didn't think that was your point. Since the testing didn't
include your preferred 'Golden Spectro' oil, the article gives no support at
all to your "feeling" that it has better sheer retention than other oils.

So, tell me again why this should change my mind about the stuff I'm using?

Dave, who's always up for a good debate

Motorcycle Oils vs. Automotive Oils


Check this out--it explains viscosity loss due to heat and mileage---and
shear values of the stuff you using.

It'll change your mind about the stuff your using---

Later,
