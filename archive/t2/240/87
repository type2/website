Subject: Re: [T2] Synthetics, and air cooled engines

Ever seen one of the Czechmobile's?

There is a double rear window---so to speak.
The air intake takes up a panel as wide as the roof width---and scoops
it into and behind the rear widow deck lid--Mucho intake/ cooling
system!!

And the engine itself is almost as big as a small block Chevy--plus the
size of the fans added onto it.

You'd have to have a pretty big shoe horn or a big cutting torch to
squeeze this baby into that little hole

Stange stuff---

Actually the vanagon has two relatively unused scoops on it already.
just open up the side vent ones all the way. right now they have
restrictions in them. But if it is that big it may be a little to
difficult to get mounted in.

And requires a lot more intake than your Van has to offer--unless you
would want to weld on a roof air intake scoop the width of your roof,
all the way down the back of you hatch to the engine---:>)
