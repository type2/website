Sounds like a good way to go, especially as it is a lubricant as well. A
trick I learnt from riding Motor bikes was to clean the terminals by what
ever means and grease them before re-connecting. I'd occasionally spend
weeks riding in mud and rain with exposed wires and never had electrical
problems. I have continued to do this to any terminal I touch, even
terminals inside my bus!
