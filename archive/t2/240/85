Dont know about his, but my standard street beetle was a 1915 with 
opened in and out ports.  heater boxes went to the storage shelf.  Gas 
heater went into the trunk space.  dont know about 74 beetle but it 
should just bolt up to the fuel tank bolts and then you measure to 
where you want an exhaust port, and measure for the output port.  I 
dont have the Eber though. mine was the "other one"

the link you want is
http://classicvw.org/
he has the entire manual for the type 3 which should be usable for the 
bug
