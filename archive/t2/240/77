Now here would be a real good combo---

A Czech engine shoe horned into a Deutschland mobile----
Another possible Morphodite---:>)

Its way too long an engine to be transplanted---Ever see one of these
things?----LARGE -----

And requires a lot more intake than your Van has to offer--unless you
would want to weld on a roof air intake scoop the width of your roof,
all the way down the back of you hatch to the engine---:>)

 
E-mail message   
 
can you dig up anything on that engine? I immediately noted euroIII
compliant and the estimated proportions of that 8 cylinder engine. if my
estmates are correct that engine just may fit in a vanagon(if i could
locate one)

Excuse me, 
I thought this thread was about oils and air cooled engines, not buying
new cars or where they are available. The fact is that VW is still
building air-cooled cars and oil technology is constantly changing.
Air-cooled technology is not standing stil, either. Check out what Tatra
is building at:
