 Richard,
Very strange that there is a length difference in yours. I measured my 77 and
it is 10". I measured my 66 and 67, both are 10". This is 255mm.
The only visable difference between them is the position of the clip to hold
the bottom end together. Early, it was around the back side. Late, it was at
the end.
Should be part # 211 827 401 to the end of 71 [211 2300 000] and 211 827 401A
from 72 up [212 2000 001].
The roller difference I mentioned earlier happened at a different time:
2 rollers were to vin # 214 2057 948
1 guide was from 214 2057 949.
Around mid-74.
