Subject: Re: [T2] Synthetics, and air cooled engines

since when did we have to use "North American" lubricants? This sounds like
the Japanese engineering and construction doctrine (their "soil is
different" so they can't allow any non-Japanese companies to bid on their
jobs).

VW has determined multigrade lubes to be superior to straight weight oils,
and has been the case for over a decade. Put the manual back in a plastic
wrapper for "old times sake" and get some new 411.

any I stand by the fact that the VW oiling system is pressure based, not
temp based, and using huge oil pumps and/or thicker oil then necessary is an
easy way to be rolling the dice with engine temperatures, more specifically
overheating. Simply looking at the diagram of how it's setup, you can see
what will happen if you have too much oil pressure from either of these two
cases. The engine temps WILL DROP if you have a thinner oil in there,
provided you still have enough pressure to lubricate and cool the bearings
(thinner oils flow faster, and though pressure drops, the bearing temps drop
too).

I'm done with this thread; you don't have to be disagreable just because we
disagree.
