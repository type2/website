Subject: Engine to rebuild



I am thinking about rebuilding an engine for a winter project.  I am looking 
for a used 1700-1800 Type IV engine in rebuildable condition ie used, worn 
out, no rods poking through the crankcase.  I have a GEX engine with 20,000 
mile on it in my '73 bus.  It is running pretty well but I have never really 
trusted it mostly because of the reputation of the company and some 
occasional strange noises. I would like to rebuild my own engine so I can be 
sure of its quality and I also would like to know how to do it.  I also need 
something to get me through the endless winter we have here.  What should I 
expect to pay for a used engine?  Where could I find a complete engine for a 
reasonable price.  I live in the Montreal area. Thanks,

James.
