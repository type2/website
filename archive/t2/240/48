Nothing happens when I disconnect the retart vacuum hose.  I could feel a
slight amount of vacuum from the hose.  All the hoses were connected
correctly, as you described and as shown on the nice diagram inside my
engine compartment lid.

So... I went out today and got a bunch of new vacuum hose, suspecting I
had a leak.  I replaced every bit of of the 3.? mm hose and even removed
the throttle body housing to inspect it (now I see how that idle adjust
screw works ;^).  At this point, I started up the bus and tried to set the
timing... unfortunately now there is NO vacuum at all in the retard hose
from the rear of the throttle body.

Yep... and now I'm stumped.  Previously, I replaced or inspected all the
other larger vaccum hoses, even put clamps on some of them.  Argh!  This
has been driving me crazy.  Now the bus is really touchy and has a hard
time starting.  I think I'm gonna head to the mechinic...

I've remember some previous discussion about using WD40 to find a vacuum
leak... how does this procedure work?
