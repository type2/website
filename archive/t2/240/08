Oh man, I had the same thing happen. I had to chisel my pilot bearing out
:-)

They also have wear limits. As long as all the teeth in the preasure plate
are good and they still have spring then its probably ok to use. Did the
clutch "skip" like a thump thump thump when accellerating? If so the
flywheel might need to be turned. But the advice on the clutch disc is to
replace it. Its fairly cheap.. and if you dont plan on having the engine out
soon might as well right?
I bead blasted my flywheel. but otherwise it was fine.  When I first bought
the bus it had that thump thump thump syndrome.. Now its gone :-) But I
replaced the pressure plate and the clutch disc.
