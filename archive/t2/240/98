Subject: Re: [T2] Synthetics, and air cooled engines

My wife has always put straight weight oil in her bus but I had always 
thought it would make sense to use a multi weight (that's why they were 
developed ), then one question occurred to me, is there any difference 
in the heat transfer properties of multi-weight or synthetic.  Since it 
is an oil cooled engine, the thermal conductive properties would be of 
far greater importance then in a water cooled engine.  I am sure that 
the vw engine is designed for a specific heat absorption and then 
radiation.
