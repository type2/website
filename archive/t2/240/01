Wrong again Terry. ;) Since I am using Mobil-1 15-50 in my bus, and have 
been since the day I got it from the previous owner, it only server to 
reinforce what I already believe. Mobil-1 is the best oil on the market. 
Now if only they made a straight 30 or 40 weight oil. It does thin a 
little more than I would like at high temperature. That is part of what 
motivated me to fit a second oil cooler. Since then I have had great 
pressure all the time as temps never go above 230. By great presure I 
mean 60-70 at startup, 20 at idle, and more than 40 at all highway speeds.

Happy busin' everybody,
