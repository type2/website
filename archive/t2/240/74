Here in the 'land down under' most bus drivers wave, and I regularly get
beetles wave at me when I'm out in the beetle. As I came into VW's from
riding motor bikes it comes naturally, I just get laughed at by my partner
if I don't get a wave back, but hey you can't expect everyone to notice
every bus on the road. I'm sure I occasionally miss seeing another bus on
the road :-(
