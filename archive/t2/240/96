Subject: Losing my bus :(


Hi,

I've got a '73 Adventure Camper that, due to divorce and financial
troubles, I need to let go of. It's a Cali vehicle brought to Wisconsin
three years ago. The odometer just rolled past 100K.

She's called The Marigold, and she's orange and white and original. With a
sink/water tank and an ice box, we've done pretty well camping with her.
Inside, there are just a few blemished. Outside is almost clean; a couple
of tiny dents (but her nose is clean), practically no rust, spare tire
with the cover on the front. I'll put up a couple of pics at
http://www.osstrategies.com/~rob/vw/ if you're interested.

It does have a problem, though - on June 9, I tulipped a valve, and since
then I haven't had the dough to fix it right. Right now she's parked in
Waukesha, Wisconsin, a half-hour west of Milwaukee.

I paid $4850 for her in 2001, which is pretty good around here for a clean
bus. I need to get either $2400 out of her now, or around $1400 plus a
good-running air cooled VW - any type, and I'm not picky on looks. I'd
love to get more, of course, but I'm going about this backwards, telling
the lowest I can go, rather than what I want to get. She's worth every
penny of the price.

My apologies for posting only once on this list, and then only to sell
something. I really want to get her to a good home, and I'm not much of a
car salesman. I'm hoping that I don't have to go do eBay or anything like
that.

Feel free to email me off list at rob(-at-)osstrategies.com. Flames are welcome
if I really broke the rules :(
