Subject: Re: [T2] Sythetics, and air cooled engines

there's a lot more to oil then pressure.

The VW's oiling system is based on pressure, NOT TEMPERATURE. if you run a
too-heavy oil in there, pressure will be fantastic, but the engine will
"think" the oil is too cold and will bypass the oil cooler. Guess what
happens to your oil temps?

You are best off sticking to a multigrade oil, and as long as idle pressure
is between 5-10psi, you are fine. This will result in the coolest running
oil and best lubricated engine. After all, if you run 0 clearance on your
bearings, the oil pressure will be incredible, until the journal burns from
overheating (oil removes the heat too, it's not just a lubricant).

Most  (not all) VW owners are ignorant about the way the VW engine TRULY
operates, and if someone tells you to run straight weights, they better have
a real good reason. The FACTORY recommends multigrades on the newest
aircooleds (why?). I think it's crazy to run a synthetic that's a straight
weight. i can understand for a compressor or another low RPM device, but an
automotive engine?????? run a 5 or 10-50 and enjoy it.
