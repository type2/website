Glen,

There are pitfalls to both---

The air cooled units you can't push too long or hard---
The Wasserleaker's have head gasket problems, as well as  miles of hose
to tend to.
But you can pretty much keep up with traffic, without frying the engine.

It isn't by any means a rocketship, but drivalbe at normal highway
speeds, and one heck of a lot more comfortable on a long trip rather
than the kitchen chair seating position of the Type 2.

The parts prices are ridiculous, but other than all this they are OK--

Good Luck,

Terry

A neighbor has a wasserbox for sale: $1,500 Great shape. NO rust, couple
dents. 
runs well, with no leakage.
HUGE inside. 
I know this is an aircooled list and I've owned several aircooled VWs,
but are wasserboxes a really bad idea? 
if the engine goes bad, Is it possible to drop an aircooled engine into
one?
