Subject: paid to drive

Hello,

I was just wondering if anyone out there is getting paid to drive their bus?  
A buddy of mine was telling me about it. I was just surfing the web on the 
various companies that either give you a car or pay you to drive your car with a 
3M type sticker ad on it.  I know it sounds funny.  Just wondering if anyone 
has done it.  Is it as good as it sounds? 

Thanks
