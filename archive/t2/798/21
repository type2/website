<How in the world is one supposed to know what's domestic and what's not? Most ot the Japanese carmakers build at least some of their cars here in US. And "American" cars are built in Canada, Mexico, central and South America. 20 years ago my Mom bought a Pontiac cuz she wanted to Support American workers. Some time later she found out that it was actully assembeld somewhere in South America.>

I totally understand. Once upon a time I told my Dad his Chevy S-10 was the samr thing as an Iszuzu Hombre. He didn't believe me but admitted I was right after he saw a few. He's a good gearhead - I figured he'd know that! <griN!> He used to rag me about my imports but like you said - what's an import anymore? 

My "German" VW Cabrio was built in Mexico, so was his "American" Chevy truck as far as I know... <grin!> His Japanese Honda Goldwing and our former Japanese Honda Accord were built in Ohio I think... 

We recently did a project here at work for Harley-Davidson... The gas tank was made in Taiwan!!! Tell that to some biker dude and see if he doesn't choke on his Wheaties... Hopefully he doesn't get ugly about it... FWIW I hear alot of the current Harley's are made from overseas components... I better not hear any snide comments about my import motorycles from Harley dudes anymore...
