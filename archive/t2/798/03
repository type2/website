Cute...

So, are the heads on the 1700 different (exhaust port wise) from the 
1800/2000??  Could you tell, by look, feel, or measurement, the difference 
between the two styles exhaust gaskets??

I mean, if I ordered and bought eight of the 1700 and eight of the 
1800/2000, and I threw them all in a pile, could someone separate them 
again??  If so, by what manner or criteria??

Basically, I don't want to order eight of the $1/each gaskets, and the 
supplier give me eight of the $.79/each gaskets.
