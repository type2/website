Hi Don,

I usually pull the two bolts that hang the tranny, and drop the  
tranny slightly. I also pull the three pieces of rear tin from the  
engine, and move the coil up on top.

This gives enough room to slide the engine off the transmission  
without running into the rear valance.

Happy trails,
