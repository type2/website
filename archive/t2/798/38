I don't follow.  All the fluid ran out.  I'll try finding the line and
bending it appropriately tomorrow.  I seem to have spoken too soon about
the shock having come off.  The metal part of it is stuck on the lower
torsion bar.  Heat someone said i believe.  I don't have a torck or
anything hotter than a match.  I could try having the wife glare at it.

Any advice?
