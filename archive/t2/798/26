Dan,

The bottom rubber bush of the shock has a steel insert, and the insert has
seized to the lower mount stud.

When this happens, the steel will usually separate from the rubber and stay
behind once the shock is removed. Then you have to use some heat or even cut
the sleeve off the stud, being careful not to damage the mount stud.
