Subject: Re: [T2] Conserving gas in a camper

I removed sink/ice box, seat, bench and 3 layers of flooring from my westy
last saturday. It feels a bit faster at acceleration. Maybe it's just
because it is louder empty :)

This morning commute consited of 3.5 miles in the empty westy and the
remaining 9 mile by bicycle. Is this patriotic ? Can it be patriotic even if
I am not a US citizen ?

cheers, happy friday - Arnaud
