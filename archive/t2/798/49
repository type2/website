Hello Mike  That is a good deal but  Fram makes about the worse filter there 
is and be careful about mixing Castrol with any other oil .  It use to have a 
problem gumming up if mixed I dont know if that is still true or not but would 
recommend not mixing with other oils   Places like autozone and advance will 
sell these items at below cost hoping that you will buy something else  later 
and have fun  Mark Dearing
