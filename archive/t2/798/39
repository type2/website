Subject: Great Oil/Filter Deal at Autozone!

Gut Volks -

Pardon if this gets duplicated... I posted it yesterday, but haven't  
seen it on the digest.

Autozone has a "5 quarts of Castrol + 1 Fram oil filter" special for  
$9.99. Two specials per customer. I got my 5 quarts of GTX 20-50 and  
an HP1 for that special price. That's like a 60% discount.

Go!
