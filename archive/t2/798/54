Subject: Radio block-off plate

Hi folks,

For the purpose of temporarily covering the radio cavity in the dash of my '70
bus for a photo shoot, I'm looking to find or make a bezel or block-off cover
plate for the radio cavity.  I've seen them for early buses but not for my
year.  Has anyone seen one of these or successfully made one that looks
stock?

Thanks!
