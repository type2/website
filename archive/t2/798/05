I've always wondered if the thickness varies. One style is for the  
72-74 style heater box and the other is for the 75-78 style exhaust  
manifolds.

I bet the vendors get them mixed up all the time. Maybe there's no  
difference. Here are the measurements of the 75-78 style from a  
Victor Reinz gasket set to compare:

36.8 mm wide
43.2 mm tall
2.18mm thick

The thickness of the ring varied a lot:

3.25-3.35mm thick (top and bottom, tall)
3.95-4.05mm thick (left and right, wide)
