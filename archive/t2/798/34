OK.  Now that I've calmed down and read bentleys on break line
replacement and bleeding the breaks using the two person pump method I'm
pretty sure me and my 8 year old helper / pumper can handle it.  My only
question now is where to get the part.  It's the small line that connects
to the caliper.  The good thing that camne of this is with the break line
out of the way I was able to remove the shock.
