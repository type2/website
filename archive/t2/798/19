Subject: Re: [T2] 78 Bus Oil Filler gasket/rubber boot 

Speaking in general terms, the world is full
of gaskets and rubber rings to such a degree
that knowing the dimensions and getting out
the relevant industrial supply catalog would
make the "NLA" problem go away for sure.

On the other hand, that is way too much work
for a single rubber ring for a single engine,
and so improvising would be what I would do
myself, too.
