Sad that the other mechanic could not determine when testing if it 
was ignition or fuel. Info you give means it could be either.

1. verify battery case and terminals clean and tight, also the other 
ends of the cables.
2. verify condition of big red/black?? wire from starter to double 
relay also in good order. If you have the LOOOOONG bolt on the 
starter, that wire is soldered to a brass bushing and failure there 
is common, resulting in low volts to double relay and everything it feeds.
3. verify same for connectors at coil then verify volt feed. If Cali 
spec, check ign module.
4. pull cover off double relay and inspect inside for evidence of 
excessive heat. Same for ECU.

Possible other causes:

Cracked dizzy cap or rotor. Poor connection to fuel pump. Clogged 
fuel filter. Bad gas. Worn AFM. Funcky signal from temp sensor. 
Broken pieces inside muffler or cat(Cali spec) creating intermittent 
blockage of exhaust.
