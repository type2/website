Subject: More sale items found

If you guys don't watch the Garage Sale section of VWParts.net, you should.
Never know. Here's a couple things I found that may be interesting. (no, I
have nothing to do with them except having been taken care of at the counter
when I lived in Cali and owning a few of their shirts):

**Brand New German VW coathooks, white or black $2.50 each
NOS Hella white bus mirrors right side, $35
Wolf nose bra blow out $25.00 each! 93-95 jetta, 89 1/2 -92 Jetta GLI or
Golf GTI, 96-97 jetta, 93-94 Golf GTI, 58-67 bug, 73-79 bus BUGPACK brand,
not Wolf, same $.
New trans throw out cross shaft 002141701A fits 71 and later bus. $4.00 each
Misc. rear emblems for VW Type 1,2,3,4 & Rabbit, used $5 each

I wish I had snagged the 1700 heads when they had 'em cheap. :(
