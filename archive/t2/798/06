Subject: 78 Bus Oil Filler gasket/rubber boot

Hi All,

My bus is doing better and better each week :-)

I'm sealing up the engine compartment and 
need the rubber piece which covers the gap
between the tin and the oil filler tube.

Bus Depot doesn't carry them. Any suggestions?

Thanks much,

Mark
'78 "Blue Bus"
Running Great!
