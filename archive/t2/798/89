Subject: RE: [T2] Pict 3 Carbs ..

Please shoot me for wasteing your precious time ..

After a whole heap of swearing it occured to me that the thing might be
running badly for some other reason than the carb being badly set up ..

While rooting through a load of spares I found a set of contact breakers
that I would have sworn to you I had fitted 3000 miles ago ..

So ... contacts .. properly set .. carb now sets like a dream as per the
manual .. CO is 2.6% at idle and 1.8% at 3000 RPM .. does this sound right ?
