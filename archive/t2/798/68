break line bent and installed.  i'm guessing it would be a bad idea to
finish the breakes and test drive it with only one front shock on.  Is
that a bad idea?

Also since all the break fluid ran out do i need to bleed all four
wheels?  It seems pretty straight forward as described in the bentleys
manual.
