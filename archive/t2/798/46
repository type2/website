Of course, at least as long as this connection holds up.

WTF happened to your brakeline?!?!?!?

You're not going to be able to pick that up at Checkers unless you make a
new one from straight line and your existing nuts. I do have a line cutter
and a bender, but no flare tool.

I'll be working on getting Troy's 78 back together and my 73 dropped and
re-ringed this afternoon. But I don't think you can drive that bus like
that.

I have a bleeding pump too. MightyVac or some such. I love that thing... heh
