How in the world is one supposed to know what's domestic and what's not? Most ot the Japanese carmakers build at least some of their cars here in US. And "American" cars are built in Canada, Mexico, central and South America. (-at-)0 years ago my Mom bought a Pontiac cuz she wanted to Support American workers. Some time later she found out that it was actully assembeld somewhere in South America.
