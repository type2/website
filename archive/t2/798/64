Subject: Re: [T2] can't remove shocks from torsion arm

<<It seems that The Boge replacement shocks I have are the wrong ones
(27-221-9?). The metal shaft is too long and the end of the bolt isn't
exposed at all. Uggh. Off to remove the new shock. It's bound to come
off easier than the old!>> 

And if you load up the shocks monting surface with copious amounts of
anti seize--the removal process will always be easy---
Be it today , tomorrow, next week, or a few years down the road.
