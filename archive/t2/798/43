You're absolutely right. Here's a site:
http://mdmetric.com/elect/1/VStdLieferPrg_240250.html

That particular site shows mounting hole sizes up to 28mm with an inner hole
size of 24mm. I haven't measured my tin but that sounds a bit small. But you
get the idea.

Any of the vendors should be able to do this, not just wait for WCM to repop
some part.
