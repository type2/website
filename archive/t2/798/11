Original part is probably NLA.  
     
To fabricate a solution, start with just the tin and
open hole.  Take about a 4" piece of small rubber
hose.  (Smaller than fuel rail hose, but larger than
the rubber hoses to the windshield washer jets.)  Use
a box cutting knife or carpet knife and slit the piece
of small rubber hose lengthwise down one side; don`t
cut the hose into to halfs, leave it intact; albeit in
a letter `C` cross section.  Then stuff the hosing
into the tin hole, bottoming-out the tin to the
rubber.  It isn't a good fit, and you may need to cut
radial slices into the rubber to allow such a tight
turning radius.  When all 360 degrees have been
filled, trim to fit.  Then re-install.   I have used
the same technique in the metal heat riser tubes which
come-up from under the cooling tin, through a round
(left side) or Oval (right side) hole in the tin. 
Those plastic or rubber parts also appear to be NLA.
