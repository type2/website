Subject: Bosch Parts, etc. on Sale

Hello Y'all, just thought I should mention: Action Import Parts in
Louisiana is having a sale on a bunch of stuff ending in a couple of
weeks. A few things worth mentioning on the Sale page are the new Bosch
SR15N starters for $99 to fit bug and bus to '71, new 009 distributors
for $59, new 30 amp Bosch generators for $99 and 30PICT & 34PICT
carburetors for $109 and $139 respectively. Their toll-free # is
888-352-7743 website: www.actionimport.com . To save some money on my
shipping to Hawaii they were willing to ship in USPS Flat Rate boxes.
Very nice people to deal with, check it out! Timo
