I'm with you. When I was a kid, in school there was talk of growing up
and doing something to benefit society, like discovering a new vaccine
to benefit the poor in India or something. While all can't be in the
medical field, I would think the ethics of altruism and benefitting
humanity should extend to those who choose other fields of endeavor,
including business. Yes, work to make your company successful, but to
benefit all, not to be some kind of corporate raider skimming off the
money for yourself and moving on to the next victim. There are some
good companies out there as occasionally written up in the magazines,
but these seem to be the exception rather than the rule.

On the contrary, Freedman's advice has gone far in encouraging
 the needless destruction of families, communities,  businesses, all in the
 name of a short term uptick on some stock exchange, mainly for the benefit
 of the options-compensated executive team and their cronies on the BOD.

 Blood is thicker than water, and in the Porsche clan, thicker than making an
 extra euro at the expense of your people.
