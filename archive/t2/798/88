Wow.

After getting Troy's 78 engine back in I went to drop the 73's engine. After
a bunch of time and both of us working on it it's still hanging by one
bottom stud and the rear skirt.

That's right. The (-at-)#$$W%&& skirt. The section is bent in a bit, just enough
to snag the fan shroud. Pry bars, hammers, and lots of wiggiling of the
engine does nothing. I'm half ready to cut the (-at-)(-at-)#%#$^&**(-at-)# thing out.

Anybody else run into this? Dropping and installing the 78 engine was a
breeze. Just after getting the engine under his bus and in the engine
compartment Troy was called away for a minute. I got the engine on the trans
in about 30 seconds. We just had to rock the bus in gear to turn the shaft
enough to get the last inch or so. So it's extra frustrating seing the 73
hung like it is.

And, of course, I have to have the engine out, head swapped, new rings
installed, and all reassembled by 5 pm today so I can pickup 120 balloons.

Sigh.
