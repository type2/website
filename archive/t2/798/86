Subject: Pict 3 Carbs ..

Hello Beautifull people ...

Sooo ..

	I was worried because I thought petrol was leaking from the carb on our
1600 Bus .. So I bought a rebuild kit and a new Carb.   I swapped them over
and am will rebuild the Solex one when I have a chance.

	The new carb is a "Bocar" one which I'm assuming is a Brazilian made
version of the Solex ...

	I went to set it up and asked my father in law to talk me through it.   His
first words are "Don't touch the big one that's the mixture the little one
is the idle .."

Head in hands moment ..

	It took me an hour after he had gone to work out what was wrong ..

So I was back at the beginning .. .. I reset with 2 1/2 turns and then
adjusting the air Bypass screw (Which is the BIG ONE just incase anyone is
not sure!) to get a nice idle ..

Either Lumpy  or .. I'm chokeing

Does anyone know what the CO level should be at idle ?   I've got a gas
analyser that should help if I had any data ...

Anyone just got any advice ?    (other than regarding my father in law .. I
have plenty of ideas of him .. and they do not involve motor cars ..)
