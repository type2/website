Subject: break line woes

I guess in a pinch I could use a regular hard break line of most any size
and fit it with the appropriate sized metric connectors?  I'm needing to
replace the hard break line from the caliper to the clip where it mates
with the soft line.  10mm bubble flare doeesn't seem to be readily
available.  Could I use another size with appropriate metric ends?  What
are my other options?
