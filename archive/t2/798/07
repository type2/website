Subject: '78 Westy - engine cutting out

Dear type 2 fans,

In June 2005 I parked after driving 10 miles.  After a 15 minute
break, I started driving again.  When I shifted into 2nd gear, 
the engine started cutting out, but did not die.  It would not
go faster than 35mph, in 3rd gear without cutting out.  Anytime
I pressed the accelerator to increase my speed above 30 or
35mph, it would cut out.  It continued this way for about 45
minutes until I was able to get it to an air cooled VW mechanic,
who has about 25 years experience.  He drove it for the next two
days, while it continued to cut out, but could not locate the
problem.  Then it started running well, and over the next 3
months I drove it 450 miles without any problem.  

In September 2005, it developed the same problem again, but this
time for only about 10 minutes.  It has been running well since
then.  It has the original engine with 155k, and I have kept it
in good condition. I am hesitant to take it on the freeway, or
make any long trips with it.  

Does anyone have any suggestions about what I should do to
locate the problem?

Thanks for any help you can offer.

Jim
