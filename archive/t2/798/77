Subject: rapping - out of the clear blue

Got a '78 Westy with a 2000 cc that the PO had
rebuilt, so probably 10k on the rebuild.  Not exactly
sure what the rebuild consisted of...  Anyhow, The
thing generally purrs like a kitten.  When I start it
after it has been sitting for a week or so, it raps
for maybe 5 seconds a little bit, then once oil
pressure comes up, nice and smooth.  

Headed along a highway today with oil temp at say 80
to 90 degrees C, maybe 50 mph, and listening to the
radio.  I turn the radio off b/c something just
doesn't sound right out back.  The old lady says "I
liked that song!" and I says, I've got more important
things to worry about...  As suspected - godforsaken
racket coming from the engine.  I mean, the SOB is
RAPPING!  Like someone taking a hammer to the valve
covers.  Raps at idle and at all range of RPM.  Got 10
psi oil pressure or so at idle, 25 or so when above
idle.  No loss of power, seemed like all cyl were
firing.

Any thoughts?  I am concerned about the sudden onset. 
And I'm supposed to be getting this thing ready for my
honeymoon cruise around Maine the week after next! 
Oh, woe is me.

thanks,
Greg, '78 westy
