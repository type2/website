Before you take it to the smog station, have someone do a "Pre-Smog"

if you go to the smog station and they punch in your VIN etc, you are stuck, 
if its a "gross polluter" you may be forced to smog it every year and not 
every 2 years....

So get it checked before you take it in for the official test.....
