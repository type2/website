They may be simpler, and they may be easier to work on, they may not be =
subjected to smog testing...but that doesn't mean they don't contribute =
to the smog problem.  If you have a vehicle that is a polluter - take =
care of it or get rid of it.

IF, indeed!
Not at all!
It's just one less PITA.. unless of course, you are especially fond of =
rules
and compliance issues. But I doubt that anyone on this list is running a
foul emitter that they don't care about.

ps..Don't forget the Beano, next time to eat Mexican food! You don't =
even
need FOUR cylinders to be a polluter, and I'd rather breathe your car's
emissions than yours.. LOL
