Hi Blake,


Currently the rule is this: 1973 and older vehicles are exempt. It used 
to be 65. The problem is, they change this yearly, it just depends on 
how hard those pesky enviromentalists push the issue. As for your 75 
becoming exempt, buy a 73 without an engine, transfer the parts over. 
(You catch my drift) Last I heard their were no plans as of yet to push 
the years even earlier. I think they figure that there arent alot of 
pre-73 vehicles on the road to be a problem.

Anyway.

Good luck  [:-)] 

Tyler.

1972 Westy Uh-Oh (with plans to start it tonight)
