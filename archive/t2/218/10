"This is why I have always preferred '71's and older.
They're simple, I know how to work on them, and NO
SMOG!"  Jan B
 
 
They may be simpler, and they may be easier to work
on, they may not be subjected to smog testing...but
that doesn't mean they don't contribute to the smog
problem.  If you have a vehicle that is a polluter -
take care of it or get rid of it.
