I think lost in this is that VW just threw a lot of items on  their cars JUST 
to get thru emissions testing.......

Now 25 years later you need to have your bus smogged and these parts were 
never made to work that long ! (GM and Ford did the same)

mostly this is true with the early 72-74 bus carb set-up, they were iffy from 
day one....and just barely passed back then, 
75s and up had Cats which cleaned them up easier.......

a well tuned car will run pretty clean, but since its the smog station 
sniffers that you need to pass you may need to do some things to make it 
pass, jetting. timing etc and after the test reset it so that it will 
RUN......
sometimes these are not the same thing......

in a perfect world  the lowest emissions would be the best running bus.......

not there yet
