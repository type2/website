Subject: Steering box crisis?

Now the bad news:

My steering box started leaking sometime this summer.
While dry this spring, its is now covered in goo in
line with the shaft. Looks like it is leaking from the
top bearing (not sure how though).  I read the archive,
but I still have questions:

1) Can I refill it short term to get by until next year
(not a daily driver), and if so how (there doesnt seem
to be a fill hole on it besides the play adjuster
screw/nut) and what do I fill it with.
2) Can I rebuild this myself, or should I just get a
new one next year.
3) The rubber isolator is cracked, but not too badly. 
How bad can they get before they fail. 

Trip coming up and ignorance IS bliss.  Shouldnta gone
under there, before I looked it was not a problem :)

Thanks
