Subject: Rear End Tent

I finally got some pics of my new rear end tent.  It was made by
westfalia in 1973.  It extends the sleeping area by three feet.  The
pics show how it is set up.  Now I can take the deluxe camping!  Casey
(6 yearold in the reaer ender, Christina and Myself on the full width z-
bed and Emma (2 year old) child's cot up front..  We are getting ready
to hit Buses of The Corn in Canada in August outside Toronto.  Enjoy!
