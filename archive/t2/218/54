Subject: Re: [T2] Oil temps after cooler

-to westydriver & list-
Your message implies an add on cooler- what I asked was what the STOCK
cooler normally does to the oil given a functioning fan/flaps system-
obviously inquiring how much lower the oil is in temp when pumped to the
bearings vs what's being picked up in the sump.

 Depending on the size of the cooler and the location of it in an
 airflow.  a medium sized one is supposed to be good for 25 degree drop
 in temperature.  Adding a fan (or having it in a hight air flow

 location) is generally good for another 10 to 15 degrees.
