Be sure to set the timing using a stroboscopic timing light instead of =
statically, as Muir suggests. If your bus has the stock =
vacuum/centrifugal advance distributor, timing should be set at 7.5 =
degrees BTDC (-at-) 900 RPM. This should also work out to be around 40-42 =
degrees BTDC (-at-) 3500+ RPM (full advance).  If the bus has a distributor =
that is other than stock, it should be set at full advance. The timing =
cannot be set accurately using Muir's suggested static timing method, =
which is one of the major flaws of his VW book.
