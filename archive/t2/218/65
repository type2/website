But where does the extra power come from to run the electric 
motor "all day"?  Please don't say it will be generated by the 
1300 engine.  :)  I think hybrids are fantastic and will greatly 
improve around-town mileage with tricks like regenerative braking, 
non-idling engines and CVTs.  I don't see how they will help 
highway mileage on level ground much though.

I want a hybrid bus with a 1.6l TDI engine, four hub-mounted 12hp 
electric motors with regen and a 1Kwh NiMH battery pack.  Won't 
somebody make it please???  :)
