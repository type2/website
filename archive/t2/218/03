Subject: 73 heater valve connections

I bought new cables and new "connectors" and can't seem to figure out how it
goes.  I can easily clamp the connector to the cable but the lever on the
heater box seems to be twisted 90 degrees from the way the connector wants
to be.  all the pictures of the heater box valves look just like what i
have.  what am I not seeing?
