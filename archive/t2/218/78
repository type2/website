Hi everyone,

Everything is right on track for the 18th "Busses Nowhere Near The Arch" =
(a.k.a. "Busses By The Arch") held at 22 mile long Mark Twain Lake near H=
annibal, Missouri held over the upcoming Labor Day holiday weekend.  We'v=
e leased the entire group campground again located right on Mark Twain La=
ke, so all you will see there are lots of VW's and their enthusiast owner=
s camping and enjoying a long holiday weekend among their old and newfoun=
d VW friends.  As usual, only VW's will be admitted into the campground, =
and advance reservations aren't needed to join us for the long Labor Day =
holiday weekend.  There will be a scenic Saturday morning Bus caravan ove=
r to Mark Twain's hometown of Hannibal, MO for sightseeing and tours of t=
he haunts of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn.  On Saturday afternoon and =
evening, tour the campgrounds and vote for your favorite Type 2's in seve=
ral serious and humorous classes.  Awards and door prizes will be present=
ed on Saturday evening (many attendees bring cool and wild VW items to ad=
d to the door prize pile!).

If you'd like to check out our simple event information web site, go to e=
ither  www.BussesByTheArch.com   or  www.BNNTA.com  for basic more detail=
s.  We've heard from attendees in almost twenty surrounding States who ar=
e planning to join the festivities.  The D.B.G. Club have planned a new s=
urprise theme this year for the "Best Group Campsite" award competition, =
and I'm sure that both the Missouri Micro's and the Buskatier's will be c=
ooking up theme encampments to entertain the attendees and vie for votes.=
  And there is always fierce competition for the best individual campsite=
 award,  as well as best breakdown story and most in need of repair and r=
estoration awards.  =20

So tune up your Bus (or any VW), pack up the camping gear and water toys,=
 and make tracks for "BNNTA at the end of August.  We look forward to see=
ing many of you and your VW Busses streaming into the Indian Creek Group =
Campground on Mark Twain Lake in about a month from now for the VW campin=
g festivities!

See ya soon!
