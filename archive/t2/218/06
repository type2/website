Hello everyone , I have one more 1979 VW camper for sale . This one has a
2.0L and an automatic transmission . This one also has a new alternator and
voltage regulator , new tires , all new fuel hoses , new fuel pump and
filter . Also a new pan gasket and filter for the transmission . The
exterior is in Good shape with a few dents . The sink , interior camping
light , and power outlets all work . The motor leaks oil and I don't have
the time to do anymore work to it . I'm asking $900.00 for this one . Thanks
.
Sorry , I forgot to mention I live in Atlanta Ga. .
