mostly this is true with the early 72-74 bus carb set-up, they were iffy from 
day one....and just barely passed back then, 
75s and up had Cats which cleaned them up easier.......

a well tuned car will run pretty clean, but since its the smog station 
sniffers that you need to pass you may need to do some things to make it 
pass, jetting. timing etc and after the test reset it so that it will 
RUN...... >>

Same problems as on other "chronologically challenged" car lists...Those
with LBC's (Little British Cars) will remember the plumbing nightmares
that MG's and Triumphs became before finally folding their hoods and
fading into the sunset...Be grateful that VW had deep enough pockets
to weather the smog (sorry) as did the larger manufacturers - Ford,
GM, M-B/Chrysler, Honda, Toyota, etc.
