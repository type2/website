Subject: Repairing a sunroof?

Hi all,
Just bought a 78 transporter with a sunroof that has
been sealed up. It looks like someone broke the handel
off or got tired of it leaking and just whipped out a
caulk gun. Any suggestions how to get it back together
so I can stick my head out while driving and get some
fresh air. Also the interior has been ripped up fairly
badly and needs to be repaired. Are there kits for
that? Thanks
Giles
