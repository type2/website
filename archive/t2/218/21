So, I got a new fuse box bracket from Joe at www.bustedbus.com  and have =
search the archives about installing it into my 71 west and there seems =
to be some concern that this may increase the probability of shorting =
out the electrical system.  I just wanted to secure my dangling fuse box =
but do not want to cause any harm.  Anyone have any experience with =
problems or benefit of putting there fuse box back in a bracket.
Thanks
Steve 71 west
pHs I got my horn to work thanks to all the input from the list
