Subject: inlet gaskets

Hi Folks,
	Bob has kindly offered to provide me with the plastic inlet spacer
that I need to get Whirlydog back together.  On closer inspection of my
broken inlet spacer there seems to be a thin gasket on either side of the
thick spacer.  These are not shown in the Bentley nor do they seem to be
avail from the usual suspects.  Are these supposed to be there? If they
are where do y'all get them from? Thanks.
