Subject: Re: [T2] Gross Polluters-what of RV's?

Hmm, I am reminded of the framed ad I have in our hall- that of a VW bus
neatly holding all the stuff they have sticking out and virtually
falling out of a pickup....at the time they didn't have to include that
the bus carries all that at half the gasoline consumption of the
pickup!   I believe that some states may have different standards for
RV's than passenger cars?  Most SUV's use more gpm than our busses, and
certainly our 22 mpg is better than any RV??  Thus our pollution must be
less??
