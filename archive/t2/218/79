Subject: Re: Sqeaky door hinge

Hi Richard,
	I use a spray on Lubriplate that wicks in pretty well and sticks.
Kroil, Slick50 OneLube, BreakFree CLP are all more powerful penetrants to
get the flow started.  Once you get 'something' going in there, you can
try a 'thicker' lube which will stay better.
	Have someone lift the outside end of the door first so that any
gap that is available is open on top of the hinge bearing areas.  I have
also found that the bar that limits the door opening angle can develop a
nice squeak. jon
