But they only pollute the earth.  Not the air.(cynical tone not so 
apparent).  BTW.  The listmember telling me I sound childish in an earlier 
post, sounds childish.  My bus runs clean, and I take pride in that.  
Telling me or anyone else to make SURE it runs clean, or get rid of it, is 
offensive and none of you or anybody elses right to tell me.  This IS 
America still, isn't it? :^)
