Yahoo hosts a couple of EV lists and they offer good advice on how to mate 
a large electric motor to the transaxle, batteries, controllers, and 
charging. I lurk on the list. Certainly not difficult.

A feasible solution would be late model small displacement engine used as a 
generator complete with air pollution controls to keep the batteries 
charged. Maybe a small displacement 1000cc water cooled motorcycle engine. 
With fuel injection and a catalytic converter.
