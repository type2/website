Not quite.  The shims are used to properly set the fan-shroud clearance.
Shims are moved from one side of the fan to the other to move the fan in
or out.  All the shims should be used, since the hub, shaft, and nut are
set up for the thickness of the fan plus shim stack.  The shims also
provide a wider mounting surface for the fan, preventing cracking of the
relatively thin metal.

That being said, I have a couple extra shims on the pulley side.  This is
in case I need to replace the belt and can't find the proper 9.5x905 belt.
The extra shims allow the use of wider belts from the FLAPS.
