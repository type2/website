Set my timing with a light while running, no vacumn lines.  set it to 7.5

Is the timing more a function of the disti, or the engine?  The disti lookup
says 7.5 BTDC for my disti, my friend with the same type of engine says TDC,
and my father says "just do it by ear"

Timing too far one way or another?
