Subject: hot 'n stanky tonight!

drove around at low speeds in city driving for an hour and pulled into my
driveway. normally i'd coast the length of the driveway to a stop. but this
night, in neutral i came to a literal screetching halt in midstream. upon
getting out of the 68 i heard the screetching again, and smelled a fateful
burning smell. nothing odd on the drivers side; on the passenger side the
hubcap was to hot to handle! for 10 minutes! the wheel too. i was afraid a
wheel bearing got gobbled. still, i hit the scene with a flashlight and
sure enough the brake fluid fill reservoir was down about 3/8" and there
was fluid on the bottom quarter/fifth of the backing plate. tomorrow i'll
pull the wheel and find something sorrowful. meanwhile, cannot get that
smell out of my head.

any thoughts on this ~ locked up wheel cylinder stuck the shoe to the
horse?  - steve
