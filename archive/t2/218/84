Subject: Re: [T2] Gross Polluters

"Do you really know this for a fact or are you just speculating?
My guess is that jets burn thousands of gallons of fuel on a cross-
country flight with no thought whatsoever to emissions.  "

     Jets burn a whole lot more fuel, especially during take off and landing 
where they also burn it fairly inefficiently.  However, once the plane is in 
the air the jet engine is very efficient at turning fuel into power and 
therefore there is very little pollution being generated (per gallon).  
However; according to studies (some internet sources will be listed at end 
of email) these still amount to less than the passenger vehicles coming and 
going in the parking lots surrounding the airport.  Of course, some studies 
say that they are the leading cause of pollution in the entire world.  
That's just how studies work I think.
     I also know that they are concerned about pollution from airplanes, 
even though that concern stems directly from governmental and private 
environmental agencies pressuring them and not any overwhelming desire to do 
anything other than make money, of course :-)
     I DO know that the more modern the plane is the less emissions they 
produce, and that standards have become tougher and tougher on commercial 
aviation over the years.  Also, the industry has a vested interested in 
burning fuel in the most efficient manner in order to reduce fuel 
consumption costs, which generally equates to lowered emissions.
     Anyway, I have not done any serious research.  The casual research I 
have done leads me to believe that airplane emissions, while certainly a 
concern, are less of a concern than passenger car emissions.  Perhaps I 
should have prefaced my statements with "I believe", but I figured everyone 
would take it with salt anyway.  If you really want to go after a polluter, 
hit the big rig trucks, now THAT is a environmental disaster.  There is 
almost no real enforced emission standards for those vehicles, and many of 
them are purposely run VERY rich for extra power.
