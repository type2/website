Subject: Re: [T2] Gross Polluters

"the Air Force does more damage to the environment with one F-16, or 
American Airlines with one 767 than all of us bus-drivers do."

I have heard this argument used by people who did not want to do their smog 
testing on several occasions for any car they drive (though I know that is 
not what you were implying, Eron, that statement just brought this into my 
head).  I will express my two cents here and hope I do not get slammed.
1) The Air Force plane defends our country and is therefore a necessity and 
not a luxury such as all personal passenger cars (like it or not they are 
luxuries and not absolute necessities, you can live without them).  If we 
didn't do it, the other guys air force would giving them an advantage, and 
when they occupied the US they would inherit a country with much cleaner air 
for our efforts.
2) Consider the fact that to accurately attribute the pollution a passenger 
plane produces it should be compared to the total pollution of the plane 
divided by the number of passengers on it.  When it's massive pollution is 
paired down to an individual person it is considerably less than if that 
person drove a car that distance.  This fact is similar to dividing the 
pollution that an 8 passenger bus or a camper produces in half due to the 
fact that otherwise you would take two cars for the people, or in the case 
of a camper, and additional vehicle for gear and people.  Therefore, the bus 
or camper usually comes out polluting allot less.  Hence, mass transit will 
almost always be less of a pollutant than personal vehicles.
     I know I am preaching to the choir here on this list, but this lets me 
vent for all those times I hear people use such arguments to justify 
removing smog devices and complaining about testing of vehicles.
