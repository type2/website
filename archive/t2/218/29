Subject: FYI Front speakers really good spot.

Hey listees:

At the wreckers I picked up two 5" speakers from a
taurus with premium sound.

I wanted to put these in the front of the bus on the
fader, since the two speakers in the rear, cant be used
with people in the van (deafens them so I can hear in
the front)

I moved them around the inside of the front of the van
while playing, and I found a really awsome spot for
them.  In my 78 its a sweet spot.  Under the seat base
there is an opening, the drivers has the brake
reservoir and the passengers has the jack.  If you
place the speakers over these openings the sound is
quite full, rich and surprisingly loud.  I've mounted
mine kind of hanging out of the hole as the 5" is a bit
too big. (the rubber is toast in those holes anyway, so
having the speaker hang out, almost looks better than
than the ragged hole)

To make this a nice install, you could make a contoured
mesh metal cover for those openings (oval shaped and
bent to form the contour) and mounted a 4" speaker on
the inside, it would look awesome too.

By the way I tried putting the speakers deep inside the
cavity, and it brings out the bass, but really deadens
the mid range.

Good luck
Logan
