most power is needed for acceleration, 1300 is more than enough to keep a
bus "at speed"  with the batteries picking up the load on hills (and
possibly getting some charging on the way down)

you set the engine for "Most economical" speed and then use electric for
everything over and above.   I was thinking 1300l pushing an alternator,
to battery pack to electric motor drive, CVT would be a bonus

the New York city transit Orion VI hybrids only have a 2.1liter diesel if
