Subject: 96mm "Big Bore" P&C set for sale

NIB 96mm P&C set from NPR of Japan. The pistons are flat-topped and the crown 
height (wrist pin bore to crown) is the same as on standard 1.8 L pistons. 
The box says "Porsche Cylinder Assembly, but I've compared it visually and 
dimensionally to a standard 1.8 P&C and they are identical except for the 
bore diameter.

$350.00 + shipping from 37853 USA.
