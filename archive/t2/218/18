Subject: A Few Small Questions

While poking around my bus tonight I decided to check that little piece of
hose on the vent lines....the one up behind the spare tire well. As
expected, the existing hose crumbled in my fingers. I cut a piece of fuel
line and slipped it onto the metal lines easily. A little tooo easily. What
size should that hose be? The fuel line I had on hand was 7.9mm.

Second question: How can I tell if I'm running lean at high speed/rpm? I
*think* I may be, but I'm not sure how to tell. Oh, 74, 1.8 ltr, weber DFEV.

Thanks in advance for any experiences, ideas, facts or opinions.

Regards,
Dave
