Or get the store to do it.  Lowe's (local home builder place) sells what
the salesman called "snowplow paint"  -- it's tractor paint, dunno why in
heck they'd refer to it that way in rural north FL but anyway -- and
they'll mix it to any of the paint cards (hundreds of variations) for
their store-brand house paint.

I tried to pick close to Velvet Green for my '65 but wasn't quite there -
still, it's quite a range of choices.  See
http://www.supernet.net/~jclark/vw/65neunsitzer/index.html for the results
(via paintbrush and roller).  The white portions are straight rustoleum
white applied via rattlecan and brush.

Peccavi, non?
