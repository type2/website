Subject: Jalousie windows plastic clip thread

Hey listees:

I was cleaning my van tonight and I removed the screens
to wash them and the windows on the inside.

I found the plastic clips. the (im sorry I deleted that
message, so Im not sure who sent the original)

They clip on the top of the screen.  They are a U
channel with the outside (inside of the van) edge
longer than the inside (window internal).  On the
outside is has a finger grip to pull the screen down,
and more importantly, it has a groove that catches the
bottom lip of the frame.  This groove locks the screen
firmly against the frame preventing all movement.

So now I need to repeat the questions:
a) Where can you find these, and/or
b) what is everyone else doing?

Thanks
Logan
