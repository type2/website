Historically, they're there because the railroads and short line trams were
forced out by the auto industry (Think "Who Framed Roger Rabbit") and the
gov't financed (Think "You & Me") highway system. Prior to the development
of the highway system, population centers were cities...Came the highways
and cars and the population sprawled out to the suburbs and now even ex-
urbs...(Think living in the Poconos, PA, and working in NYC...)
