just because the air force and commercial airliners do more damage,
doesnt mean smoke bomb vehicles should be allowed to make it worse. dont
use the "they're doing it, too!" argument... sounds childish. just
because someone else is worse, doesnt make it right for anyone else.
pollution is pollution.

now i know that all old cars do damage to the environment, let's not
start that argument, but if properly maintained, it isn't unreasonable.
