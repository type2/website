You canna' change the laws of physics, Jim!

Assuming that the "BTU" rating is really "BTU/hour", which is how
most A/C equipment is measured:

32,000 Btu/hr * 1 hr/3600 s = 8.89 Btu/s
8.89 Btu/s * 1.05506 kW/1 Btu/s = 9.38 kW
9.38 kW * 1 hp/0.74570 kW = 12.6 hp

(Conversion figures from page 30, Bosch Automotive Handbook, 4th ed.)

Maybe it's just me but 12.6 hp doesn't equal 1.5 hp. 

As a comparison on the Btu/hr rating, the smallest window air
conditioners that you can get for around $120 are usually 5,000 or
6,000 Btu/hr.  A 6,000 Btu/hr A/C will cool a 350 to 500 square
foot second-floor room on the north or shaded side of the house,
depending on where you are in the US.  This is a volume of 2800
to 4000 cubic feet.

By comparison, a Bus is less than 530 cubic feet overall.  On
the other hand, it is much more poorly insulated and more exposed
to the sun than a house is.  Car air conditioners are generally
far oversized compared to house air conditioners, but that's
because the specs are stiffer: a house A/C might be expected to
cool a house from 100 degrees to 75 degrees in an hour, while
a car A/C might be expected to cool a car from 120 degrees to
75 degrees in 5 to 10 minutes.   

The new Bus A/C being developed might indeed be a great improvement
over the stock unit.  But if it's going to put out the maximum
cooling possible with those dual 16,000 Btu/h evaporators, it's
going to pull way more than 1.5 hp from the engine.
