Getting your engine ready for "smogging" involves tuning it to a set of 
specifications that will get you the best possible combination of power, 
driveability, fuel economy and low tailpipe emmisions.  This process will 
also troubleshoot your engine's key systems and expose a variety of 
conditions that could leave you dead on the side of the road someday if they 
were not caught.  

After investing time and possibly $$ in this I'm not sure I understand why 
you would then want to set it back the way it was before your test! 

You pass the tests by confirming that your compression is within specs; your 
valves are set correctly; your sparkplugs, wires, coil and distributor are 
all doing their jobs; you have no vacuum leaks; your temp sensor, O2 sensor, 
AFM and ECU are working properly; your mixture is adjusted to specs.

After accomplishing all this, I sure wouldn't pay someone even_more_money to 
reinstall my old, fouled plugs and loosen some important nuts and bolts after 
I pass!!  : )
