Subject: Carb tuning for a 009

Hey all ...

A new engine I recently set up for a friend's Beetle is having some growing 
pains. I overhauled the carb and swapped out the stock distributor for a 009 
(stock one was pretty worn). My question: what adjustments do I need to make 
to the mixture and volume settings to get the carb to idle well? The stock 
settings do not seem to work well with the 009 ... it tends to stall when 
the choke unloads before the engine is fully warmed. Any advice on 
adjustments to the mixture and volume screws to work with the 10 degrees 
BTDC timing at idle? (the original dist. timed at 2 or 3 degrees ATDC ... we 
are at 8,000 feet asl)

I know someone will have some insight on this ...

Thanks very much,
