Re Logan's use of speakers in front of the seat pedestal holes-
Did you check out the cavities behind the kick panel?  Fits 9" ovals set
at an angle, and you can fill it with fiberglass to control booming- and
no cancellation of sound feedback or vibration of cheap box panels. 
Without enclosing them completely, how did you prevent sound
cancellation (phase feedback)?
