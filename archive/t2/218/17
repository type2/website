Hi  folks,=20

My thanks to those of you who responded to my request for an original =
price for a 68 Type 2 my insurer seems happy and I am enjoying the type =
2 instructional?? e-mails :-))

I have a new "small problem" I need a Passengerside Windshield Wiper Arm =
for a 68 bus.
I have checked Bus-boys and they no longer hold stock. I have been =
looking for a week and still cannot locate a wiper arm. I am  reluctant =
to follow Bus-boys advice and change the wiper shaft, as there is =
nothing wrong with the current item.
Does anybody out there have a spare 68 type wiper arm or know where one =
may be obtained?=20

Yours hopefully Russ
