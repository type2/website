We've got a couple of cats (who knows what kind of breed). They are Mama 
Cat and her grown "kitten".

We also have a dog. She's a 10 or 11 year old Blue Belton English 
Setter. She's really part of the family. LOVES to go for a ride 
anywhere. Took her to a party tonight in our VW Cabrio with the top down 
and got all sorts of positive comments about her looks and behavior. I 
think she was behaving better than some of the human kids there... GRIN! 
She LOVES to go for a ride in a car, truck, van, bus, whatever. She will 
even ride around the yard in the back of our youngest's electric plastic 
"John Deere Gator".

The comments we overhear people make trying to ID her breed is that she 
just must be some sort of long haired Dalmatian... GRIN!

Kids and dogs seem DRAWN to old VWs. Dunno why.

Oh and we have a couple of the two legged critter varieties who talk. ALOT.
