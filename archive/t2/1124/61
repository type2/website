Are those the exact same thread size and type?  Make sure they are - 
hopefully you didn't mangle the master cylinder threads.

I would change out both switches while you're at it, especially if 
they're the same age.  That would suck to change one out and then have 
to change the other and re-bleed the system.

Just make sure you bleed the entire system, and make sure you use NEW 
brake fluid - you'll probably need one of the large bottles.
