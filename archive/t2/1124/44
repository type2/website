Hi Ben,

Those PDSITs are for a Type 4 engine, so it wouldn't be a simple bolt
on operation.

The manifolds won't fit your heads. I don't know if anyone even makes
manifold for that carb. Aftermarket manifolds are usually for people
wanting to put big carbs on.

Also, the linkage assembly is not right for your engine, so you would
have to come up with another linkage, which is not cheap, or rig
something up, or chop the one you have, which would reduce the resale
potential of the kit.

One might work okay as a single carb, but you again have to face issue
like bolt configuration, linkage adaption, fuel mixture, vacuum
signal. Plus that carb is set up with a central idle system that works
off the vacuum lines in the dual carb setup. Just don't see how it
would work well.

You'd probably be better off selling the kit and using the money to
buy something else.

John
