Subject: Re: intake manifold mystery hose

Jamie is correct. All US spec 71's have vac assist front disk brakes.  The vac
line is a special reinforced hose with reinforcement that keeps it from
collapsing under vacuum. At the rear it goes from the manifold port thru the
firewall on the left/drivers side, and then to a metal tube that continues to
the front of the bus.  At the the front end of the metal tube, there is
another piece of the same type hose that makes the final connection to the
vacuum booster/servo.  Do not leave this unconnected - otherwise you have a
major vacuum leak and your brakes won't work very well.
