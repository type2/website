Subject: Email archive update

The email archives have been updated as of this morning, and contain all
emails up through last night. Below are some other changes I made to the
search engine as well.

1. Redirect in place. You can now use http://type2.com/search to get to the
search engine.

2. Code revision
	1. Search form now focuses automatically upon page load.
	2. Check All/Uncheck all buttons now in place

3. Minor formatting changes

4. Link now available to example page that shows some syntax examples to help
get the most of your search results.


Still on the list of to-do's is getting the subject line of the email into the
search results. The message number isn't exactly that helpful. But, as before,
all the emails are there. Read the example page to help get your results more
accurate. Such as, if you find an email and want to see the rest of the
thread, copy the subject line and go put that in the search box with quotes
around it. Then you'll get only emails with that subject line.
