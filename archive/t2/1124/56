Subject: Brake Lights requiring excessive pedal force

Hi,

I've noticed lately that I've really got to apply a lot of force to
the brake pedal to get the the brake lights to activate.

Any ideas of places to look before I start considering replacing the
two brake switches on the master cylinder? I'll check my grounds but I
can't see how a grounding problem could cause the behavior I'm seeing.

Thanks
