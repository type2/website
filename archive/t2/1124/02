Isn't technology wonderful? Thanks for posting the graph of your climb.

I've been watching the Tour de France this week. When the riders were
on a Category 1 hill, they passed a road sign that said 8%.

When the TDF originally categorized hills, it was based on what gear
you needed to drive a car in to get up, so a Cat 1 hill meant you had
to go up in 1st gear.

When the hills are steeper than that, they were rated as HC, Hors
Categorie, or Out of Category, or cannot be categorized.

Today they take more into consideration when rating hills, like length
of the climb and how fast the riders are expected to be going, but
it's an interesting historical perspective.

On your graph, the initial drop really skews the average and you
really have a steep climb. So, yes, I'd say you are just overly
worried and that you took the hill very well if you never had to shift
into 1st.

Good call by Jim on the carb, by the way. The vacuum advance is more
significant at light throttle for freeway cruising, but it's not a bad
idea to tap into a better vacuum signal or change the carb.
