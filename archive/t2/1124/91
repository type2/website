wow.. did the nice old mechanic take back the asbestos ones..? reminds me of
my neighbour... he invented a motor to drive the fuel rods in and out of the
Candu nuclear reactors.... they wanted him to take back some to rebuild...
lol  he didn't want any part of a radioactive worn out drive....

as for the smell.. strange listening to the thoughts .... it must be the
combinations... almost a pheromone
sampling and worried about product liability from the same,

I always wondered how coarse that "horse hair" was.. all the horses i been
around arn't as course.. I have never heard about coir, a coconut fiber
before... cool!
