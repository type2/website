I agree the RVs are not camping. Plus there's the minimalist aspect
you are talking about. Also the self-sufficiency feeling of being able
to do it yourself in a practical vehicle, and not needing the excesses
of a big, expensive vehicle. Fuel is high in those RVs too.

Glad you made it safely and had a good time.
