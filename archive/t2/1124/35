Subject: Solex 32-34 PDSIT-2

Hi Folks
         This might be a real stupid question!! but then I've asked stupid
questions before! I have four of the above mentioned carbs. I also have a 34
Pict on my 1973 Bus 1600 eng. The 34 is badly worn so I first looked at
installing the twin set up, I seem to have most of the linkages etc. But it
doesn't look like it would fit my engine. I don't appear to have the room and
I don't want to go to all that work only to find they either don't fit or are
no better than the single carb sey up. My stupid question is can I use the
32-34 PDSIT-2 as a single carb set up to replace the 34 Pict???. Thanks for
any help you can offer
                                regards Ben (irishrover)
