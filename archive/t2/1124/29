depends,  if the shifters all tore apart up there, get you a rebuild kit, 
and see if you can set it up per the manual, and get all your gears, also 
pick up a coupler 311-798-211, they go bad too, while your back there make 
sure the trans nose looks ok, and adjust the clutch cable.

Should be good after that, if not, it's probably some thing in the trans or 
the clutch is roasted.
