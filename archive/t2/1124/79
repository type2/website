Subject: Re: [T2] what year is that? - friday topic

Being asked about the year or what I have done to my bus or super beetle is
half the fun in driving them.
I did purchase antique tags from their original year to make it easier for
people to know the year.
Still people are curious about other peoples toys. That is what makes them
more special when played with.
