While you wait, if you can get the battery charged, you might see if
it will start by pouring a small charge of gas into the throttle body.
If it will burn that off, then you know at least that it runs. You
might be surprised too that it might keep running. You may just need
to get the fuel pump primed and get gas flowing into the lines.
