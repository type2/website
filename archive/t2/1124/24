Yep, brakes work great.  No problems there.  (Knock on wood.)

Just hoping to head off at the pass a

      My '73 has no vacuum assist for the brakes
(less to go wrong; I'm happy 
with this) so I wonder whether a '71 had vac
assist. If your brakes really do 
work well, it's unlikely they were
originally equipped with vacuum boost which 
is now disconnected.  Do your
brakes work really well?
