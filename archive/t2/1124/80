Subject: Re: [T2] what year is that? - friday topic

you could have a licence plate that says  "1969 BUS"

and people will stand back and ask.. what year is it???
or .. the other guy will adamantly argue that it is definitly a 6 v  1967 ..
with an original 15hp 2 cyl engine.. and man,, are those things SLOWWWWW!
.. or what ever!  lol

My Wife has developed a keen sense to look for clues... like a lic. plate
with 74 Charger.. or a display sign that says, 56 Ghia owners Linda and John
from Timbuctoo.
And when she over hears someone say... oh look ,, that is a 1980 exactly
like I owned!! .. I wonder who owns it.??
She replies.. oh , I think linda from Timbuctoo.... but I thought it was a
56???  and does she ever make herself look like an expert genious..  most
never clue in how she knows all that info.

just life!
Jamie
