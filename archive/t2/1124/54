Hi!

First ride this morning with my t2ab (1972) after fiddling around for
six month. So I was really happy for 30 minutes or so when my blinker
stopped working. Here's the problem: The indicators on the instruments
now glow permanently. Outside all blinker lights  just stay dark. Same
if I turn on the emergency blinking. Any ideas what's wrong? My guess:
its the relay.. If so, where is this relay?

I appreciate any help. Thanks!

Cheers!

Daniel
