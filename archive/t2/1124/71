Subject: That old VW smell

It's not just the horsehair ("Standard Damp Horsehair Scent #16...
--giggles--) 
which adds add a certain "flavor" that is present in other
really old vehicles 
but not elsewhere...  but there's also a scent that
is like a combination of the 
old paper heating hoses, combined with old, old
dust and hot engine metal.  
Maybe a touch of burnt oil, but the hot metal
smell is dominant (at least to 
me)..  Probably a touch of asbestos or some
other minerally thing.  


I had a '53 ford and a '60 Plymouth Fury that had a
very similar scent...  but 
different, which is where I got the hot motor
smell thought from - maybe it was 
the magnesium cases?  or *not* having a
heater core but the exhaust heat...  
Something different...

Whatever - it is
a very familiar scent.  And one I missed.
