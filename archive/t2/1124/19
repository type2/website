Subject: intake manifold mystery hose

Hi,
I just got my first bus (71 Transporter)  a few weeks ago and I've been
studying 
the John Muir book and going thru the engine compartment.  I've been
going slow, 
doing what I can, learning a lot.  My question is--there is a
woven hose coming 
from intake manifold on the left hand side and on my bus it
goes nowhere, it's 
just danglling.  Is that supposed to connect back to the
carb?  And if so, where 
on the carb?

Thanks,
Mandy
