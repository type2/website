Ok, thanks.  I will block that bugger off.  

Just to clarify, the mystery
hose comes off the intake tube where it bends 
toward the spark plug.  The
woven hose is 1/2" and about 18" long.  


Thanks

Hi Mandy,

I'm
pretty sure Jamie is correct, that it is a vacuum assist port for the 
brakes.
If yours is not connected you should be blocked it off to prevent air entering
the manifold causing your engine to run lean.
