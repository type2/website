Subject: Heater box drain holes

I know that for most of you, heater boxes are not high on the agenda at
this time of the year! Here in southern climes though it's winter and I
have been trying to track down the air leaks in the system. Found a big
one - the flexible pipe was disconnected at the front! I also found a
small hole in the front of each heater box that has been punched in the
metal, presumably as a drainage hole. With the engine idling, hot air
pours out of them. I have never heard anyone mention them, nor can I see
where the water would come from and why it wouldn't evaporate out when
the engine was running. The question is, do I need them?

Martin.
