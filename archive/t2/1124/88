Not much asbestos until you get to the late bus frankly, VW studied it, I got
3 sets of heat exchangers from LeCroix back in the day when these lists
formed.  They were not at all interested in pre T4, pre bay buses, the nice
old VW mechanic who was doing the change outs for VWoA who was obviously
sampling and worried about product liability from the same, stated because the
content before that was trivial.  He was a nice old guy, factory trained in
Germany, lived around Leesburg VA, had some great stories, sort of had lived
the story of VW from 1949 or so onwards.
