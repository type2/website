Subject: Delmarva VW shops/people

Time passes, entropy increases....

Does anyone have a handle on the VW situation on the Delmarva peninsula?
There used to be half a dozen people in Sussex and Wicomico counties, as
well as the rest of the peninsula that worked on aircooled engines and
bodies (bugs and buses) but many of my old familiars are gone or dead.
About the only one I know is still in existence is Dick's Autohaus in Queen
Annes.  Does anyone know any VW shops over closer to the shore?  There used
to be someone in Delmar... is he still around?
