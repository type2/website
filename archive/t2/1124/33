Mandy,

    Please note: all answers so far have been correct except for this point. 
The vacuum has nothing to do with the actually stopping ability (friction) 
of the brakes. The engine vacuum when applied to the brake booster/servo 
generates assist when applying the brakes. The brakes will still stop the 
van without this assist, only problem is you need a 500lb gorilla to push on 
the peddle!
    If your brakes require a very high amount of peddle pressure, hook that 
vacuum system back up and see if your brake leg stops looking like it 
belongs on Arnold Schwarzenegger.
    Sometimes people disconnect this hose for various reasons, some of them 
are: The vacuum booster/servo diaphragm will develop an internal vacuum leak 
causing rough running and heavy peddle pressure. (repair: replace 
booster/servo) Some will draw brake fluid from the master cylinder. (repair: 
replace both master cylinder and booster)
    If your lucky enough to have power brakes (and a 71 should have), hook 
this system back up and enjoy a much better ride! A long drive in the 
mountains with a full load (people or stuff) and you'll be glad!

Have a good one!
