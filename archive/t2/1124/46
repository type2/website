Subject: was fuel pump (fixed)

well to put it to rest, and as an update, I had a thread started where I was
having a whole engine skip, I have fixed this issue since, I ziptied the all
connector plugs for the FI ( AFM Dual relay and such) and the skip is gone.
musta been a loose connection, so for now I will leave it as is, but will
need to un tie them one by one to find the culprit.
Thanks for all the suggestions. Joe
