Daniel -

Check under the driver's side of the dashboard.  The fusebox is also a relay
plate with a few relays plugged into it.  Look for a BLACK cubed type relay
that has 3 terminals.  That's your flasher relay.  There's probably a a
couple of other relays there too.  The SILVER cube relay with 5 terminals is
the headlight dimmer relay and the small SILVER cube relay (about the size
of a sugar cube) with 2 terminals is the buzzer relay that sounds off when
the driver's door is left open and the key is till in the ignition - a lot
of people remove and toss it because they're bothered by the noise.

Get a replacement flasher from one of the list vendors.  Its the same relay
for any 71-79 Beetle, Bus, K Ghia, 80-91 Vanagon and a buncha watercooled
VWs as well.
