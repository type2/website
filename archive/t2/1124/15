Subject: RE: [T2] Trip Report .... Maryland to Arizona and back via

John that's a great Story, I think maybe you did not come quite far enough
west to find the rest of the buses, were all here, in Oregon and Washington,
the daily drivers that is.. But I find myself envying the story of your
adventure.. I would really like to organize a bus road trip.. maybe to
Sturgis or something crazy like that.. 

I know what you mean about the RV super homes.. and in my option NO THAT'S
NOT CAMPING!!!
