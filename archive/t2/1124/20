Subject: Re: [T2] intake manifold mystery hose

just guessing..

the 71 may have vac assist brake booster .. you can check under the driver
floor.. there might be a large round canister that the brake master cyl is
attached to.

that hose from it.. should lead back to the engine area... and should
connect just below the carb

the woven hose just below the carb.. usually about 14 - 15 mm in dia
inside.... goes to the brake booster in the front of the vehicle

if the hose is smaller... it could be a vac port for the distributor... and
a lot of 71 have been converted to 009 distributor.. which do not have a vac
advance.   so you could be looking at a plugged distributor vac line.
