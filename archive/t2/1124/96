Subject: my new bus (update)

Hey everyone,
About a week ago, I posted that I got my first bus (71
Transporter) and it had a 
problem with cutting out at idle.

Well, here's the
update.

It turned out to be a faulty idle cutoff solenoid, that plunger thing
on the 
side of the carb.

So, now that's fixed but I still have rusty gas,
some kind of liquid leaking out 
of an inner cv boot, and sub-par P rated
tires.

After I get those things squared away, I'll be tearing up the streets!
Thanks for all your helpful suggestions,
Mandy in Western KY
