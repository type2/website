Subject: Re: [T2] Trans stuck in gear

That happened to me once. Got a bus sitting a long time. When I got it
running, test drive only gave 1st and 2nd gears. Actually had the
tranny replaced and the old one on the ground when I got up home from
work one day and my friend told me he got the old one working. Said it
just got stiff inside and he was able to gently work it free.

But in your case, I would try the coupler first. Shifting at the stick
may respond better than a punch in the bolt hole.
