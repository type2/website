Subject: Engine rebuild in Portland

Good morning Volks,

My 1973 Nikita Westfalia tune-up fiasco last fall devolved into a complete
restoration. Thanks for all the help with the 050 distributor timing, but
now I have bigger problems. Nikita is mostly stripped and should be ready
for the body work in a couple weeks. Can anyone recommend a real craftsman
in the Portland, OR area to do the engine rebuild and/or replacement, and
install? I'd like a super clean job and a respect for the original specs.
I'm more in the 2k price range and not the 10k price range. I apologize in
advance if requesting a recommendation is against the rules here. Is it
better for me to attempt to do the work myself with a box motor in the price
range I'm in? I'm game to scour Ratwell's pages and try myself if I have to
but I'd rather have a specialist do this work. Any advice? Thanks!

Heath
