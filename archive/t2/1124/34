Andy,

That's true, but the part of the heater box with the drain holes is sealed off
from the exhaust gases. So I still can't see where the water comes from. Does
anyone else have these holes?

Hi, Martin.

H2O is the result of the chemical reaction that occurs when HydroCarbons
(HC) and Oxygen (O2) are burned together. Hence, a lot of what comes out of
your tailpipe is water vapor (H2O) and Carbon monOxide (CO). You don't
usually see much water or vapor because the exhaust gas temp is so high.

Often, when a newer vehicle has not yet warmed up, you can see water pouring
out of the tailpipe as it accelerates from a stop. Once the exhaust system
is warmed up, the vapor no longer condenses inside the system. Newer cars,
of course, have a much longer exhaust pipe than our rear engined VW's, so
the system heats up much more rapidly.

One of the truisms of VW lore is that if it cost any extra money or time to
do something in the manufacturing process, if it was not necessary VW would
not have done it. I'd leave them open. If the rest of your heating system is
tight, those holes won't make much difference.

Keep warm!
