I would highly recomend using dot 3 and dot 4 fluid or just dot 4 when you
replace the brake fluid. Dot 3 fluid is absorbs moisture and allows it to
corrode steel brake parts. I do not know the correct term, but Dot 4 will
actually trap water and keep it from reacting with the steel brake parts. The
two are compatable and even using some Dot 4 will help in your system. I just
replaced the master cylinder on my yoda and replaced the dot 3 fluid with Dot
3 and 4 fluid. I am not trying to start an off topic subject about brake fluid
but VW bus systems are so old, any corrosion portection will help.

Just make sure you bleed the entire system, and make sure you use NEW brake
fluid - you'll probably need one of the large bottles.
