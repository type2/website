Subject: Trans stuck in gear

OK, I have a '78 Bus that is stuck in a forward gear.  Bus has been sitting 20
years, PO said that it was running/driving when they put it there.
(I have my doubts, as shifter was loose, lockout plate was upside down)
Can't get it out of gear, can't get neutral.
Shift linkage checks out OK, shift coupling at linkage/trans was twisted.
I removed the coupler and tried to work through the gears with a punch thru
the bolt hole.  Feels like I can get two gears, but no neutral in between.
I was able finally to get some side movement, but the bus is still in a
forward gear.
My guess is that it is jammed up inside the nosecone and I know that it will
have to come out, but what am I probably looking at once I'm there?  Not a
transaxle guy, but I'm going to pull the nose and have a look.
Anyone with prior experience in this?  How'd you fix it?
Thanks,
Greg
