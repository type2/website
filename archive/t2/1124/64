Was writ:
"I would highly recomend using dot 3 and dot 4 fluid or just dot 4 when you
replace the brake fluid. Dot 3 fluid is absorbs moisture and allows it to
corrode steel brake parts."

Actually I believe they are both hygroscopic(absorb moisture from the air).
That is why you are supposed to flush and change them out. They can absorb
moisture from air, they rot out your brake lines from the inside, and you
won't know until you can't brake. Then again, if you system is air
tight-they should be fine. The difference between Dot 3 and Dot 4 is their
boiling point - see cartalk below.

Ray: The two fluids you mentioned, DOT 3 and DOT 4, are the most common
grades of brake fluid (by the way DOT stands for Department of
Transportation). And the difference between them is just the boiling point.
DOT 3 is fine for normal cars and normal driving. DOT 4 has a higher boiling
point, and is for vehicles that do a lot of mountain driving, high speed
braking, or trailer towing. The higher boiling point prevents the brake
fluid from boiling when the brakes are used excessively.
