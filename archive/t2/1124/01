Joshua -

Sounds like you have a stock set up regarding your distribuor.  Take a
looksee at my website for what was originally installed on your Bus:

Timing specs are there for you to look at.

Generally both the Bosch and VW numbers are stamped into the case, but you
may have to remove the distributor to verify.

One important note from my personal experience.  The original carburetor
used on this application was a Solex 30PICT-3.  You've indicated yer running
a H30/31PICT replacement.  The vacuum signals generated by either carb is
different.  The 30PICT-3 generates a larger amount of vacuum signal for the
original vacuum only distributor.  The H30/31PICT generates a smaller amount
of vacuum and may not pull the vacuum diaphragm enough to effect a proper
advance.  That's why using a SVDA distributor (which has both vacuum and
mechanical advance) is better suited to this carburetor, as the vacuum can
doesn't require as much signal volume to properly activate.  See this link
about this distributor:
