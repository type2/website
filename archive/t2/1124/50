Subject: [T2] sliding door adjustment

Hi Folks:


I am installing a replacement sliding door on my '78 Westy and I have run
into a bit of a problem. I put the new door on, and then followed the
various procedures listed in Bentley to adjust for fit and smooth operation.
It now closes fairly well... although still not perfectly (I am hoping a new
guide bushing will improve operation). And it fits pretty nicely, EXCEPT for
the lower rear corner. And that's the problem I am inquiring about. The
lower rear corner of the door is pushed out a bit from the body.  I can't
see how there is any adjustment to draw it in. I have included photos
showing the problem here:
