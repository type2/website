Subject: Re: [T2] Trip Report .... Maryland to Arizona and back via

Thanks for a great report.  I plan on doing that kind of thing myself 
when I'm able.  We really need to hear stories like that.  Keeps us 
motivated.  Next time, send updates from the road. 

And to the rest of the list, I've seen more T2's in Greece than anywhere 
else I've been short of Mexico.  There are lots of Bays still on the 
road.  Especially in Athens.

Ciao from Santorini (today).....KR
