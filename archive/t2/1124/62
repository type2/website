Yes they appear to be exactly the same upon close visual inspection.
It would be a hassle to strip the threads and to have to replace the
entire MC but there are worse (and more expensive) jobs.

Noted, that is the current plan.

Yup. Entire system was bled 2 years ago after I purchased the vehicle
and replaced all the rubber brake lines. Used the blue DOT4 fluid at
the time. Planning on using the amber DOT4 fluid for this flush/fill,
it's nice to see the color change and know that the old fluid is gone.
