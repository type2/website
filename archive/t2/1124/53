Richards site is awsome! ... only thing I see with that sliding door write
up.... I personally would never ever grease the tracks of a sliding
door..... VW ,, or garage......
any door that I have had experience with that slides in a track... has
bearings... if you lube the bearings,, and make sure things are aligned, the
door will move effortlessly.

If you grease a door TRACK... and especially in COLD climates.  the grease
becomes really stiff and impedes the way the rollers travel.

if you grease a door TRACK ,, and especially in HOT climates,, that grease
will end up on EVERYTHING you own! lol

as for the OP question of the secret to adjustments.........   I am not much
help ..  but I know there was a really good write up somewhere

I have always just sort of tried a little this way, then some the other
way,, and they have worked ... but if you find a bent one.. or something
worn.. and you don't know it.. you could become frustrated!

Good luck
