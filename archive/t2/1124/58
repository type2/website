Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Lights requiring excessive pedal force

I've experienced this and it was the senders.

You can test it by measuring the voltage you're seeing after the sender.  If it's low, then its the sender.  

You can clean off the spade connection and/or squirt some magic de-oxidizing/electrical-contact-cleaning spray on the contacts to see if it helps.  You could also soak the senders in solvent to see if that cleans them out.  However, you could also just throw a new sender on.

I believe - if you want to be cheap - that you could just replace one of the two senders, and it'll work fine, but why not just replace both, right?

Good luck!

Cheers,
   Tom
