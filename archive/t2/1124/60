Subject: Re: Brake Lights requiring excessive pedal force

Follow up:

While sitting at a stop light I knew something was wrong as the brake
pedal slowly sank to the floor. I pulled into the local FLAPS which
just happened to be at the next turn.

Went under expecting the worst - a blown brake line or major MC
failure. Found brake fluid leaking out around or through one of the
brake switches. Checked in the FLAPS but they can't provide a new
switch until tomorrow morning.

Searched around the toolbox and parts stash and came up with a spare
oil pressure sender - which I proceeded to install into the MC where
the failed switch was. It is holding fluid successfully, at least
enough to get home, and with the bad brake switch disconnected I'm now
getting much more responsive light activation.

Now out to the garage to find that spare brake switch.

thanks
