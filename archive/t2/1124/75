Subject: what year is that? - friday topic

Do you guys ever get tired of that question - What year is that? It has
gotten to the point I may just get a sticker that says "It's a '69" then
again I think about making up a year.maybe responding, "It's a '99, it's a
European model." I'm sure you guys have come up with better answers.

 

Another common question. "Did it come like that?" (re my single cab)

 

Although my favorite was some guy telling me that my single cab did not come
like that, and he liked the custom job I did on it-even after I explained to
him that it came from the factory like that.
