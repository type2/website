Just hoping to head off at the pass a possible blind alley ;-)  :-
	  My '73 has no vacuum assist for the brakes (less to go 
wrong; I'm happy with this) so I wonder whether a '71 had vac assist. 
If your brakes really do work well, it's unlikely they were 
originally equipped with vacuum boost which is now disconnected.  Do 
your brakes work really well?
