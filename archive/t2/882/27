sorry, don't always take the time to bracket the quotes.  should the pusrod
be that loose.  wait, i guess you're saying if the valve adjuster is that
loose then the pushrod will be loose also and that is ok.  i looked at the
adjusters and the adjusting screws are all at different depths.  the
exhaust, the one on the end, adjusting screw was not as deeply sunk as the
others but had less play than the intake.

not my situation.  both intake and exhaust have adjusters.  i,ve never
adjusted before, so learning will be fun.

thanks busahaulic.  acvws are slightly addictive.  btw the web page and
albums were quite helpful.
