Subject: Re: [T2] exhaust leaks- are old gaskets still available?

I have a 78 that failed exhaust connections (they place a rag over the 
tailpipe), and believe me, there are indeed enough connections that can 
fail with slight leaks in all those u-pipe connections .  The current 
"solid" gaskets are useless when flanges are slightly off; the old ones 
with the "asbestos" core were better- are they still available?  Napa 
sells a white sheet you cut gaskets from yourself and I sandwich 
slightly wider-cut gaskets to rust-thinned flanges to seal.  Also, I've 
never seen a crossover pipe- every muffler I used bolts via 3-hole 
connections directly to the heaterbox rear.

quoth Greg: "The 72-74 system has only 6 gaskets in total (4
copper exhaust manifold + 2 trapezoidal at the muffler. The insanely
over-complicated 75-78 system has the same 4 copper at the manifolds, 
but then
has 2 to the u-pipes, then 2 to the exchangers, 2 to the crossover and 
another
from the crossover to the muffler. Add another one or two for the cat if you
need it and you can see my point. Each of those extra gaskets are a leak
waiting to happen. "
