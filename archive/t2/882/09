Don, could you explain in more detail how that little pulley attaches and
where it sits relative to the fan?  By "behind the fan" do you mean to the
fore or aft of the vehicle? 

I have most of the parts of an A/C system but no diagrams!

What exactly do you need? The 79 AC kit I have here used 4 studs on the fan
shroud, some metal brackets, and a pulley to replace the spacer behind the
fan.
