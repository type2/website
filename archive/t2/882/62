The adjustment is the screw right on top as you look down from the  
hatch. In some rare cases the AFM will still have the blue plastic  
plug covering the screw so remove that first (pick)

The screw will vary the %CO at idle for more extreme adjustments you  
need to pop open the top. See my photos:

However, if the HC levels are high then that means too much unburned  
fuel is coming out the pipe. This is often attributed to a weak  
ignition system.

What are the results and what was done to the engine before it was  
driven to the test?
