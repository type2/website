Subject: valve timing

	TDC is doubtless fine  -  if you can determine it correctly. 
But what about the apparent alternative: isn't a valve fully seated 
i.e. rocker clearance maximal if the other valve on that same 
cylinder is wide open?  I have used this idea on other motors; is the 
detuned aircooled 4000 rpm VW motor designed with vastly more overlap?
