Terry is absolutely right on this one.  The dent guy that I have used 
lately on a new car was *terrific*.

One dent that I thought ruined the car forever was absolutely invisible 
when he was done.

Look in the phone book for *paintless* dent repair.

I can't recomend these guys enough.

Cheers, dave

 And as I'm not there and don't have one iota of a clue of what the
 damage is by a internet description--don't ask me ---pick up the
 Alexader Graham Bell, and make a couple of phone calls.
