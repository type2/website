Subject: Rebuild or replace?   1.8L FI engine from 75 Auto westy 

Hi Volks,

A couple weeks back I was asked to look at a local bus because of noisy 
valves and I quickly discovered a huge gap between the rocker and 
lifter on #4 intake. Tonight I had a closer look and it turned out that 
the #4 intake lifter will not come out of the bore. The exhaust lifter 
slides out without a problem, but the intake lifter must be mushroomed 
a bit from the back.

So now we have to figure out what to do about it....

I don't have room or time to split a case right now. I know I could get 
it apart; but the odds of it working after *I* reassembled it are not 
good. I don't have time and I don't have space.  It's gonna need a 
lifter for certain, and a cam is VERY likely as well. At that point 
it'd be stupid not to do all the bearings and balance everything... And 
suddenly it's labour day and there are still parts out at the 
machinist.

Besides which, there don't seem to be  many engine builders in the 
Toronto area doing aircooled work. If anyone wants to recommend one, 
please let me know.

There's a busdepot long-block for $1349 (+$300 core) that is looking 
good.... He's gonna spend more than half that in labour pulling the 
engine out and stripping off the tin and FI... why not get an engine 
with a warranty and upgraded heads  instead?

OTOH, the engine that is in it just had a head replaced less than a 
year ago, and it's a low-miles bus. Maybe a quick cam/lifter repair is 
the way to go?

FEEDBACK VERY WELCOME.

BTW, anyone with a suitable turnkey or longblock engine for sale in 
Southern Ontario, please drop me a line.

Happy trails,
