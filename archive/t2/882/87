And that's probably it. But it seems to me that regular use of the stat
would make it last longer than letting it set for years and years. The metal
it's made of was certainly chosen for this application. I'm sure setting for
years wasn't included in the design specs. ;)

Does anybody know just what the metal is? It looks like a kind of copper
alloy to me...
