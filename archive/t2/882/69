Prices differ locally, and as per how many dents where.

And as I'm not there and don't have one iota of a clue of what the
damage is by a internet description--don't ask me ---pick up the
Alexader Graham Bell, and make a couple of phone calls.

The local dent guy will be more than happy to give you an on the spot
estimate.
