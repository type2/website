Hi Jon,

The 72-74 exchangers are just plain bigger.

But how muchheat you get depends on the quality of the exchangers, the 
joints at
the risers, the flappers, the cables, etc.  Those variables have never been
stable enough on my buses to make a fair comparison. I can say for 
certain that
a good 75-78 system is better than a bad 72-74, and vice versa is also true.

Is it worth it? I says Heck Yes! The 72-74 system has only 6 gaskets in 
total (4
copper exhaust manifold + 2 trapezoidal at the muffler. The insanely
over-complicated 75-78 system has the same 4 copper at the manifolds, but then
has 2 to the u-pipes, then 2 to the exchangers, 2 to the crossover and another
from the crossover to the muffler. Add another one or two for the cat if you
need it and you can see my point. Each of those extra gaskets are a leak
waiting to happen.

Happy trails,
