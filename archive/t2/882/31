I do want to clarify for jeremiah at what point he is measuring the 
lash. For all cylinders it should be read at the top dead center of the 
ignition cycle of that cylinder, any other reading is bogus. I'm not 
sure if this has been brought to your attention yet and didn't want you 
to spend a lot of time chasing it down. There are various ways to test 
that you are TDC, Karl has elaborated several times on the list how to 
do it and a search in the archives will give you some great ideas, here 
is one.
