I think Boston Bob's advice is sound.  What you have to have BEFORE adjusting carbs or timing is confidence that your valves are all fully opening and closing. If not, whatever settings you make now will only be temporary since the operation of the engine is changed considerably when they do open and close fully.

I'd leave it run with zero lash for a awhile.  I assume you changed the oil. You may need some good oil additive formulated to remove varnish/gum to get at the lifter interiors if this doesn't work.  If THAT doesn't work it is probably lifter remove and renew time.
