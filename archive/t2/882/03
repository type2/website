Subject: 77 Westy exhaust and fan housing attachment

My muffler on my 77 westy just broke right off at the heaterbox triangle, leaving it's triangle piece still attached to the heater box. The strap that goes up to the alum. fan  housing assembly is what is leaving it from dropping down. I went to remove the bolt on the fan housing to remove the strap but it is just turning around and around. 
What I need to know is whether that is a tapped hole in the housing (that is prob stripped now), or is it a nut and bolt that goes right through? Surely it is a threaded hole in the housing?? The reason the muffler prob broke there is the strap was loose from the P.O. and when I started to investigate found it couldn't be tightened, just spins.
Thanks, 
Courtney
