on the way home from work stopped and bought a compression tester.  pretty
simple tool.

cylinder #1   50 then 0 then 0 then 0
            #2   115 then 115
            #3   105
            #4    115  then115
these are all fairly safe readings excepting of course that peach, cylinder
# 1

so injectors are probably fine.  that's good.  consulted bently.  checked
valves per bently.  if i read bently correctly,  the intake for # 1 is the
furthest front.  the exhaust is third from the rear or second from the
front.  if this is correct, the exhaust valve rocker arm or the second
rocker arm from the front,  has about a quarter inch of play moveing back
and forth between the pushrod and the valve stem.  the pushrod aslo seemed
very loose in the tube.  the anatomy of goethe's dark underbelly is still
new to me so if none of this makes sense blame my ignorance and brash
overconfidence. so, do i next attempt to adjust the valves?  if not, what
now?  this whole ordeal has my psyche flitting, yes flitting,  between deep,
dark depression and a sarteien desire to stand  in an existential rage
against the ineviatble futility of it all.


thanks to everyone for the help.  i would have been completely lost with out
the list.
