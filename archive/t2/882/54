Subject: RE: [T2] Massively rich or ...?

A friend just bought an '82 Vanagon.  Took it in to get emissions 
test.  It

pegged the meter on HC in both low and high RPM, and failed CO at 
idle.  I

am not sure where the adjustment screw is on the AFM, am currently 
searching

the archives for that, and am not sure what could cause such a massive 
rich

condition?  Ideas and hints?

 

 

Perhaps a vacuum leak. My (former) '84 Vanagon did this while returning 
from Everybus a few years back. A plugged vacuum port had somehow become 
"unplugged", and I was suddenly getting 5-6 miles per gallon (thank God gas 
prices then weren't like they are now!)
