That's punny.

65k on a rebuild is not bad but it depends on what was paid or how  
the bus was treated/serviced.

It sounds like the P&C are shot so you might as well rebuild.

If that's the case they won't have any trouble refunding the core fee  
upon inspection whether or not you have an engine built because they  
are paying for your core parts.

I find that most rebuilders use another case in practice because the  
core is sent in after the new owner has taken delivery of the rebuilt  
engine. It's more the exception that your case will be returned as  
your rebuild.

By holding onto the case, rebuilders have something to dip into when  
there is an immediate warranty issue. Often when you ask for your  
core back immediately you get told that they haven't looked at it yet  
and may take up to 90 days.

Anyway, that's my comment about the industry.

It that scenario plays out, then you are out of pocket an extra  
$100-150 which is a pittance in the overall R&R cost.

As I understand it, the main issue with damage to that part of the  
case is support for the camshaft which is right above may have  
deformed as well. In that case, I don't think $50 is going to cover  
the costs of repair and I've never head of a linebore of the camshaft  
(the non-std size bearings are not common either).

Second, what condition is the camshaft in after this damage? Most of  
the rebuilders in that price range reuse the camshaft if there is  
enough metal on the lifter contact surface.

All of these are just guesses until everything is measured.
