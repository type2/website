Subject: Re: [T2] exhaust leaks- are old gaskets still available?

I'm in the same boat myself, have to replace a broken "eliminator" muffler, and am looking at gaskets. I think I'll just get some sheet asbestos from a marina, or equivalent used for hot gaskets, and cut my own. Being PC is getting ridiculous, asbestos is safe to use with common sense, probably LESS dangerous than the solvents used in modern paints or plastic manufacture.
