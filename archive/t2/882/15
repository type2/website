Subject: High Country Bus Festival 10 -  2006

first of all, let me apologize for getting this info posted so late this 
year.  things have been busy in buddah-world........plus we were waiting to 
tie down a few details for this years event

here we go:  the 10th annual HIGH COUNTRY BUS FESTIVAL
                     July 28,29,30 - 2006  near Boone, NC

we just launched our new website today:
http://www.highcountrybusfestival.com/

be sure to click on the "new for 2006" page to see what new stuff we have in 
store this year;
- The Wedding
- Snoopy's Offical Welcome Home Party
- Aerial Photgraphy is Back
- the Blue Ridge Parkway Foundation

I will need some help with volunteers but I will send an email about this 
later, I wanted to go ahead and get this information live.

I have gotten the same bluegrass band from Kentucky that picked for us last 
year to come back for Saturday night...............plus many of the other 
HCBF regular events you have been used to.

that's it for now, please let me know if you have any questions.

thanks
buddah
