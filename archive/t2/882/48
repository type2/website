I'll have to price an EGT gauge. Most people who buy
CHT gauges really need a EGT so they can see all 4
cyls on one gauge. The individual gauge-per-cylinder
is still preferred as it does 90% of your diagnostic
work for you, but at least by monitoring exhaust temp
you can see when something has changed. I have never
used one, so I don't actually know if the scale is
such that a problem would be easily detected.

If you need a sensor lead, I have a couple with
nothing to be used on. -BaH
