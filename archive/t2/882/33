Subject: RE: [T2] CHT gauge testing

It was already mounted by the PO under the dash to the left of the steering
column. I would like to get the 4 gauge setup you have, but it is $200 and I
don't have that right now. This gauge has never worked, and I just now got a
chance to look at it. Next time I change the plugs, I will test the sensor to
see what I get. Looks like I will probably just have no gauge until I can
afford a 4 gauge cluster and senders...

BTW - where
are you going to mount the sensor so that it will tell
you anything about your engine? If only a single
sensor, better to go to exhaust temp sensor as it will
monitor all 4 and maybe help you catch a problem. -BaH
