If they're still using AVPs you might want to think about that. It's been
discussed here and on the Samba a few times now, so I won't rehash.
Especially since I didn't buy the engines in question.

I have yet to hear anything that would steer me away from BostonBob (
www.bostonengine.com). But they're quite a bit more: $2000-$2500. In those
ranges I'd rather buy a Camper Special kit from Raby for $3k and assemble it
myself.
