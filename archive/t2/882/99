Hi Cliff,

We burned half a case at Buses Of The Corn 2003:

Once was enough for that stunt. It killed the grass about 4' outwards  
around the fire pit and I don't want to think about how toxic the  
smoke was. Once you light the fuse on one of those there's no way to  
extinguish it and it's bright enough to be a "hazard to navigation"  
as BOTC is within a mile or two of a regional airport. There's also a  
prohibition against fireworks at our campground and I don't want any  
hassles with "The Man" at BOTC.


Happy trails,
