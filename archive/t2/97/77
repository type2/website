Absolutely.  I had this problem when I brought my 66 home.  It cranked and cranked but no start.  I replaced all wires, plugs, fuel pump and filter to no avail.  Then, just for kicks, I pulled the coil out of another bus I had in my barn and put it in the 66.  It fired right up and has run like a top since that day!
