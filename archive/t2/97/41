Subject: Re: [T2] Please help me start this old bus!

Dave, many thanks for posting the URL for your photos [
http://www.shockwaverider.com/78bustankjob/].  They have to be the clearest 
photos of how a tank is installed in a bus that I have ever seen.  The shots 
of the vent lines and the rubber connections, the second elbow between tank 
and fill tube, the entire interior of the fuel tank compartment...WOW!

I would like to ask if there was a way to get them into the archives as a 
data source to reference when folks on the list talk about "gas smell while 
turning," a "leak of gas from the left side," "how do I remove my gas tank," 
etc.  With the addition of a photo of the first rubber fitting behind the 
bulkhead cover on the right side (big round black metal plate) it would make 
a complete picture set.  Bentley, Haynes and others have nothing equal for 
visually describing all the little bits and parts of rubber that should be 
replaced every now and then, as well as being sources of leaks and fumes 
(smells).

I have to remove and clean the tank in my '71, and although it is different 
from a '78, I am better prepared now than before.  Having a '72 and '78 as 
well, your pics are invaluable.  I would really hope that they make it into 
the archives, but better yet, into the technical section.

Two questions for the list:  1.  How long does it take for gasoline to turn 
solid, if the bus is just sitting?   weeks, months, years?    2.  It appears 
that there is room to add some Reflectix in the gas tank compartment.  Would 
this contribute to sound deadening/gas tank cooling?

Dave, many thanks once again for a super set of photos!
