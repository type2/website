Over geared and overloaded.

Would be better with an early '70s vintage tranny at least.

Had a roommate when I was stationed in Italy that had a 3.88 geared Super 
Beetle with a 40HP engine. Same symptoms. Was quiet on the highway. You had 
to gear down for any hill though.

Take your friend for a ride in a properly set up 2.0 bus. Let him drive. 
Maybe that will register.

I have often gotten blank stares from folks when I lecture about cooling 
tin, etc. Maybe it is the material and maybe my lecturing style... <grin!>

The power thing is the reason I'm slowly moving towards a Corvair 
drivetrain. I've all the pieces, just need time and money to rebuild the 
Corvair engine.
