Subject: Re: [T2] Please help me start this old bus!

Hello List,
    There has been an awful lot of talk about cleaning old fuel tanks. Is it
possible to buy a new one? Where? Would it be just as cost effective? Also,
if the inside of my tank isn't gunked up, should I still be considering
cleaning it?

Thanks,
Jim
