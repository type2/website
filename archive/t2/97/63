Subject: Tranny in a bus that's been sitting awhile

Hi all,

I just bought a 70 bus that I'm currently trying to get into good working 
order.  I'm doing a complete overhaul on the engine, and when I brought the 
case and its components to the machine shop, the dude said it looked like it 
sat for awhile at some point.  Is there anything I need to do to my tranny 
(aside from tearing it apart) to ensure it continues to work?  Are there 
common problems with trannys that have sat for awhile (I don't know how 
long).  The guy I bought it from drove it occasionally, but he only owned it 
for about a year, so its history is unknown.  Any help/pointers would be 
greatly appreciated.

Mike
eugene, or

70 camper bus, currently in pieces....
