A metal dash in a US spec Bay could cause problems with both
inspection (depends on the age/state) and insurance...The plas-
tic dash is used to conform to DOT crash standards. In case of
an accident, the insurance company might fight paying some
medical bills because of "alterations after inspection" (I be-
lieve that's the phrase). Don't snicker, when I was taking my
'59 Bugeye for inspection I was failed once because the con-
vertable top had a replacement window without a DOT imprint.
I argued that it didn't matter since the original window didn't
have anything, but the inspector countered that upgrades had
to conform to present specs...I went to another station and
told them it had no top at all and passed.
