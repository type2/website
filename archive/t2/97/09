My '73 Safare has no added reinforcement either.  It looks like the center 
beam was cut out by a drunk guy with a sawzall.  They tacked some trim over 
it so it wouldn't be visible.  The removal of the brace hasn't caused any 
noticeable problems though.  My guess is that the highroof itself, being 
screwed down every six inches or so, provides significant reinforcement.
