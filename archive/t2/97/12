Hello All   The best repair I have used are the Timeserts from Wurth. Come in 
a kit with the drill bit, tap. countersink tool, installtion tool and 
timeserts. These put the treads back to the correct size. I wouldn't recomend 
using JB weld cause if the stud comes out so does all your oil. I used a 
pencil to plug one one time on the road to get home, just drove the pencil in 
and broke it off to plug the hole, it worked good enough to get home and fix 
right then.  Latter  Mark Dearing Salem Import Service Salem Va
