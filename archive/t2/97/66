Well, I can help out with badge prices.  My 90-year-young father runs an
engraved plastic badge and sign business.

Figure on about $7 per badge for a 2X3 badge with name, simple line art
logo, and name of group.  Add shipping and a small donation for the list
fund and the price would come out to an even $10

I like the sticker idea too.  I'm sure that the type2 list would be
interested, so I'm crossposting it there as well.
