Dave,

Thanks!  The pictures are part of the reason it took me soo long to do the
removal job<grin>.

I will have a big update on the process for the list soon...there is  lot
more to "boiling out" a tank than meets the eye and it appears from other
e-mails that quite a few people are contemplating this job soon.


I already checked this morning on how to get articles in the library and
will do my best to shoot some more pics to go with the others...am hoping
to get a shot of the inside of the tank, do some more write up and then
submit for the library.

This tank had been sitting for 8 years...pretty hot summers/cold winters.
I believe that it was pretty full when it was parked also.  I have worked
on a 68 double cab also and after 12 years of sitting, the tank just had
black goo...the stuff in the 78 was *rock* hard *everywhere*.

Maybe it depends on the type/brand of gas also???

Cheers, dave
