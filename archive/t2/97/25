Used a tube of "muffler mender" yesterday to patch gaping wound in my 
muffler. 

Definitely quieter today. Anybody have a life expectancy for these products, 
or know something of what's in them?

Curious,

Sodium silicate, IIRC. Strong base so try not to get it on your hands. I'm
also pretty sure it's available in larger, cheaper sizes in the plumbing sup-
ply house as furnace cement (for the fire box; not the water jacket sealer).
If there's a way to wire a metal patch over the cement it should last longer
than the usual week or so.
