I see what you mean Dave.

Looks like the lever that the pull rod fastens to is a lever "missing" from 
my carb setup.

It appears I am missing that second lever; the "fast idle lever".
(I have the throttle valve lever, of course.)

I wonder how I might come up with said newly-discovered-discovered-missing
"fast idle lever".

Would it typically come with a new carburetor purchase, or does it have to 
come off of a NOS or junk yard found carb of original vintage/configuration?

Casper does not have this second lever, either,
so can't rob Casper to feed NewBus.
