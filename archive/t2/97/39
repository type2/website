Aron,


I am still in the process of doingthe same thing on a 78 bus that sat for
8 years.

Pull the gas tank out and clean it....don't even think about it...it *is *
the easy way.  I spent 3 months trying to get mine cleaned out without
having to pull it....it don't work!  When I finally pulled it, there were
chunks of dead gasoline in it that were covering the pickup tube.  

Don't think about it, just do it.  Pictures are at 

http://www.shockwaverider.com/78bustankjob/

Pay particular attention to #12....yes, some of those are more than
1/4" thick.

There are many other things that will need doing, but I'm sure others will
cover that.

Cheers, dave
