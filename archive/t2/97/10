Subject: A circuit for your ancient fuel injection system

Despite the simple design of our fuel injection systems, a little circuit 
to help diagnose problems similar to the Vanagon List's Digifant tool would 
be nice. This is essentially just a circuit to turn on a light when one of 
your sensor's quits putting out usable information.

It could also be used to do any number of items.

I have no interest in this circuit, I make no money off of this 
information, and I only want to offer the link to you for you to do good 
things with it. I think there is enough info that we as a list could piece 
together a circuit without ordering a kit.

Also if anyone could retrieve this article as a .pdf file I would love to 
have a copy. Meanwhile I'm be saving an HTML version.

Looks like all sorts of warning lights could be created from this circuit.
