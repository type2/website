Hi Rob, Aaron, Volks;

It's  a PITA, but you CAN remove the tank with the engine in place. My
westfakia needed a tank swap last spring and I managed to get the tank out
without an engine drop.

First I had to pull the carbs; but they needed to be cleaned up anyway--it
took a full can of cleaner to get each carb back to bare metal. to squeeze
the tank out through the rear hatch I had to remove the engine support bolts
and drop the engine 3/4", but I did not have to remove the engine or touch
the tranny bolts; just drop the rear of it a little.

If I had an FI engine I would have dropped it rather than dismantle all that
stuff, but with carbs it's that little bit easier.

Drop it anyway, it'd be a good idea to have a peek under the engine tin to
make sure you haven't got a rodent or insect nest in there blocking the
airflow. Aircooled engines must have airflow over the fins or bad things
will happen.


Happy trails,
