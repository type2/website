Subject: Sweet Pea Rides Again!

Hi Folks,

Well, it was a long road, but it was worth it.  I installed my newly-rebuilt 
Jake Raby 2.0 FI T4 engine into my Bus this weekend, and it runs great!  It 
has good, smooth power for a stock 2.0, and there's torque aplenty 
throughout the entire rev range in all 4 gears.

If anybody on The List is looking to rebuild their T4 engine, I would highly 
recommend Raby's Aircooled Technology to anyone.  Their prices are higher, 
but the quality product is worth every penny.  My Bus feels much more solid 
and more powerful, and there's nothing like the peace of mind one gets from 
a brand-new engine.

Thanks to all who offered advice, suggestions, and moral support during this 
long process.  Now that I have a great engine in my Bus, perhaps I'll see 
some of you at this summer's campouts.

Take care, and happy motoring.
