Subject: '73/'74 Dash Trade

What I have: 

Pristine European painted metal dash for a '73/'74 Bus. In Europe 
the plastic dash was an option all the way upto '79. I think/thought 
that all US market Buses after a certain date had the plastic dash. 

My dash is beige primered inside out, no dents, scratches or rust. 
the radio hole is enlarged to accept a DIN format radio/casette/CD 
unit. I did this myself and did it very carefully, it's exactly in 
the middle, perfectly straight and smooth edges, it looks factory. 
It has only holes for the light switch, and for the hazard switch, 
nothing more. The dash is currently installed in my '74 single cab. 
The primer is a two-component professional primer, ready for a 
light sand and paint. It was primered about 7 years ago. Used in 
my car since march 2000. I can send a picture of half the dash 
as installed in my single cab and shows how the radio sits in it. 
It makes for an ultra clean look. The strap for the glove box is 
perfect, straight, and secured into place with a little pop rivet. 

I would like a pristine '73/'74 plastic covered dash for my single 
cab. No cracks or scratches however small they may be..  I'm not 
trying to be ignorant, but honest, these things tend to keep me 
awake at night :) .. and only holes for the light switch on the 
left, and the hazard switch on the right. Light surface rust on the 
inside is ok. 

Since the dash is in my daily driver, and yours might be too .. I 
am in Pennsylvania, would be cool to get together and do a swap. 
I know this may seem like a unusual post, but hey ..  who knows :) 

Have a nice day all, 

Brian
