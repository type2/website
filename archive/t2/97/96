Subject: Haven't you always wanted a VW Bus calendar?  Here's your chance

Forwarded for a friend.  Reply to him not me.  (also could someone forward
to the Vanagon list for me)

"Here's your chance to get the 2002 VW Bus calendar
being created by the Full Moon Bus Club. After never
being able to find a VW Bus Calendar, we decided to
create our own. It is a 14-month calendar, which makes
it good through February 2003. Since this is the FIRST
year for the calendar, all you have to do is send
$15.00 for each calendar (including mailing costs) to
the following address: Rodney Kindlund, RodKraft
Studio, 477 Panther Branch Rd., Alexander, NC
28701-9662

The calendars will be available after February 15,
2002
and will be mailed directly to the address you state
on your order. Please send check for the amount and
your name, address, city/state/zip, and email address
to the address above. In six months we will be working
on the 2003 calendar, so this offer is only good until
February 15, 2002."
