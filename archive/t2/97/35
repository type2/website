Greetings listees,
    I'm having a problem with my 2.0L Type IV engine. It was rebuilt by =
a reputable garage in Jacksonville,Fl...(they seem to have a good =
reputation and specialize in air cooled VW's) so we'll stay with that =
assumption for now. Engine is warranteed for 12,000 mi. I have put 1200 =
mi on the engine and with the exception of come carb problems have been =
very pleased...good power, 19-20 mpg on the road, smooth. Oil change at =
500 mi without incident. Last week as I was driving away from my house I =
noticed a chugging and a definite loss of power. No noise, clunk, or =
bang just loss of power.  I have dual Weber 40 IDF set up and a mild cam =
(3/4 grind is what the shop told me). Mileage has plummeted to 10-12 due =
to my need for nearly full throttle to achieve any acceleration to keep =
up with traffic. I pulled the plugs and found #2 rich with carbon, not =
wet. All the other plugs were looking great. I have thoroughly cleaned =
the carbs, replaced the points, condenser, plugs, cap, rotor, wires. =
Replaced the intake and carb gaskets, checked all vacuum fittings and =
rechecked the valves (hydraulic). No improvment. I swapped sides with =
the carbs...no change. I tried an old set of 34ICT's...no difference. I =
borrowed a compression gauge and found all cylinders equal but reading =
60lbs. A local mechanic (I have moved 300 mi south of Jacksonville) who =
works on Porsche and VW tried to fool with the carbs but made no =
difference...didn't charge me for this after spending 2 hours on a =
Saturday. Nice guy and comes highly recommended. He is stumped as well. =
I can't imagine what is happening to this motor. I plan on buying a =
compression gauge and re-checking. Any ideas why #2 is not giving the =
same burn as the others? I am asuming this is the problem cylinder but =
I'm open to ideas. If I tightened the oil drain bolt too tight 1000 mi =
ago could this be the root of the problem NOW?? I don't have a torque =
wrench but don't think it's that tight...>9ft/lbs. HELP
