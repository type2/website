For all you wanabusers who lurk, this is the A1 best way to buy a bus, perfect
body, blown engine.  You buy the engine from your favorite rebuilder for $1500
and you know exactly what you got.  Look at that thing for heavens sake,
unreal.
$500 and they asked at $900 for a long time, I bet $400 would walk away
with it.
O to be on the wrong coast as usual.
