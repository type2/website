Subject: mystery tranny

ok, i have archived, libraried and googled... nada.
i am looking for the identity of a tranny i started to clean up; it has
five ribs, a 091 part # and - oddest of odd - an early bay bellhousing
bolted on it! it was in a 71. sort of a poor-man's freeway flier i reckon.

the tranny # is:  CP 02 09 6.

none of my books have it either.

i need gear ratios to determine how bad an idea  ;)  it is to strap this in
to my 1600dp, at least until i can get the present CORECT tranny rebuilt.
