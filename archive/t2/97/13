Subject: Re: Stripped Threads, oil drain plate

I use 8.8 bolts from the inside of the case out, regardless 
of whether the threads are stripped or not. I use the stock 
copper washers under the bolt heads on the inside, and use 
green loctite to hold them in place, gently tightened. I use 
a longer bolt on the one stud holding the oil pick up. There 
is also less risk of having this one nut loosen and end up 
somewhere you don't want it to be. I used 2mm thick 6x17mm 
aluminum washers off of Porsche 911s with plastic valve 
covers to help keep the drainplate in shape. Be careful to 
use the bolts in a severly lowered car with sump. Use them 
to mount the sump, but use studs for the drainplate as the 
sump could easily hit the road, bend the bolt, and there's 
no easy way to fix it then. 

To fix this one leaky/stripped stud, try to get a bolt in 
there, glueing it in place with green loctite, or, find 
a longer stud (maybe the stud that holds the oil pick up from 
a case you may have laying around), degrease thoroughly, 
install stud with loctite, install nut with loctite, even 
nicer may be to double nut this, so as to tighten them to 
eachother, making sure they won't come off into the engine. 

Hope it helps, 

Brian
