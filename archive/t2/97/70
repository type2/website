It's not at all extreme. Gasoline generates static electricity during the
defueling operation. You know the classic formula: gasoline + static = big
boom.

It generates static when you put it in, too, which is why all gas pumps
nowadays have a notice "keep the nozzle in contact with the vehicle during
fueling." Gas pump hoses have ground wires in them; they connect to the
nozzle.
