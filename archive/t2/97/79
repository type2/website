Subject: bucking at high rpms


I have a 1977 bus that bucks when I am going to change gears. If I change
gear sooner than I would normally,I can avoid it bucking. I recently had the
fuel tank cleaned, and put in new fuel pump,fuel filter, and injectors...

I am not mechanically inclined but want to learn so any help in lamans terms
would be greatly appreciated!
thanks, Julie
