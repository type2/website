Subject: re:  '76 FI Bus woes

Hello all listees, thanks for you past help with my thermostat & other difficulties.  I'm still searching for a cable att=
achment & the housing if anyone can help (or recommend a website?)
Right now, the issue I'm having is that my bus will start only when I apply steady gas to it. After ten minutes of this, =
it will run on it's own (somewhat).  The real issue however is that when I decelerate, the engine will bog down & stall.
Can anyone suggest what I should look for?

Thanks all,
Sean
