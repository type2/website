Subject: '74 to later steering wheel adapter

Volks,
Anyone out there know if one can buy some kind of adapter for steering
wheels?  I'd like to put a later (cushiony) wheel in my '74, but the later
splines are larger.  I know it will fit differently with the turn signal
switch, etc, but I'd like to see if I can do this.

Thanks in advance,

Paul
