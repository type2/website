I'm not sure I would tear the tranny apart.

I think a better plan would be to just check to make sure fluid is in it, 
and let it go at that.

Trannies are pretty robust, and unless it has been damaged, I don't think 
you need suppose that just setting around has caused it any damage.

After all, it should be full of fluid, and if that is the case, it has just 
been setting around in a happy state waiting to be used again.

If I were to do anything at all to the tranny, I might drain the oil and 
replace with new, but even that would be going against my really strong 
senses of logic where I sometimes can convince myself to stick with the 
logic of  ...... "if it ain't broke, don't fix it."
