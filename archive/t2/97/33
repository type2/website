I don't *know* why they rust from the inside out, but I know they mostly
do.  My guess is it has to do with the lack of venting on the uprights.
If you look closely at your beam, you will see the bottom drain, but you
have to look very close.  And you can't probe it because it is blocked by
the bent-over edge.  There is a similar vent at the top, but you can't
probe it either (blocked by the body).  I think crap gets in, can't drain
out and it therefore rots from the inside out.

First, let's define "getting bad".  If you see *any* rust-through, it is
way too late.  That beam is dying.   There used to be weld-in plates for
bugs. I have never seen them for buses, but they probably exist.  I would
*NOT* use them!  The beam is just too critical to your safety.

On coating for rust prevention, I don't think so.  I wish it were, but I
can't think of a practical way.  Maybe injecting the cavity with waxoyl or
similar would help, but any drilling would weaken the beam, so the holes
would have to be small and carefully planned.  Actually I think that a
couple small holes at the bottom of the beam to promote drainage might
actually help substantially.  The present drain is dirt flat inadequate
and always has been.

I do *not* think that filling the cavity with grease or tar would be a
good thing.  I have seen way too many applications of both where the
tar/grease just served as a trap to hold moisture against the metal,
promoting rather than retarding the rust.  BTW, one of the checks that I
now run, courtesy of John Anderson, is to check and wipe any excess grease
off the beam after I grease it.  I had thought I was preventing rust, but
he showed me where the rust was forming under the grease because of
trapped moisture.  A thin coat is good, a thick glob is bad.
