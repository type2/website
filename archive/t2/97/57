Subject: Re: [T2] Please help me start this old bus!

hey everybody,

Thanks alot guys for helping me prep the engine, and for giving me a guide 
to take out the fuel tank.....Dave, those were awesome pics on how to remove 
the gas tank man.... I checked the plugs and drained the oil.... the plugs 
were black (soot? carbon? old age?) and the oil showed pieces of debris in 
it (doesn't look/feel like metal..)before I bought the car the owner told me 
it had a brand new "rebuilt" engine that he purchased for $1700... he said 
he parked it one day on the lawn and it never ran again....he said something 
about the smell of fuel...

thanks again for the help everybody... when I get the time and the money I 
think I'm gonna pull the engine and REALLY look things over...

later,
-Aaron
