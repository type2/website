Thank you. I didn't know painted baywindow dashboards were that 
rare in the US.

The person who'd trade would not be into utter originality I 
think, as truly original to that Bus would be that plastic dash.
The kind of person that would want a different looking dash, or 
just to be able to color match it to the exterior of the car, 
could also be the person installing a modern day car radio I think, 
just like me, and like how my single cab would be less original 
with the plastic dash in it.
