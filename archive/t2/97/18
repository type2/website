AFAIK, all US baywindows had padded dashes.

Hmmm.  You want to trade a metal dash with an enlarged radio hole
(it may be done carefully, but it is still not original) for a
pristine original plastic dash?

I'd say that uncracked plastic dashes of that vintage make hens' teeth
look plentiful!  Perhaps in a museum, but not in a real-world bus!  Also,
I don't think any buses came to the US with fewer than three holes in
them (light switch, wipers, hazards) and probably two or three more
(interior light, defroster, silver socket).
