Hey volks

My 72 started out as a Sundial/Safare hightop camper that I pulled the =
top off to install my pesent top that rises on both ends.
When I removed the old top I was distressed to find that the roof was =
not reinforced uppon removal of skin and center beam(above rear end of =
sliding door).
Has anyone else dissasembled this kind of camper and if so what have you =
found??
Wish I hadn't sold my welder!
