/* PITA that it is, you might consider pulling the rear drums to check if
   the studs are loose/turning in the drums.
   Left field guess: are the stud holes in your wheels worn to the point of
   letting the nuts press against the drum instead of pushing the
   wheel against the drum...? I had a wheel that was left loose by a  tire
   repair shop and the hubcap slapped back on. It only took a
   couple of blocks to loosen entirely and wobble wear the holes in the
   wheel to complete uselessness...

Well this is the two-piece system, the hubs looked to be in pretty good
shape. (Bead blasted etc)
