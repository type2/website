Hiya Bob,

I believe that you are referring to the Sliding Hinge Link Assembly.  It will 
come out as a unit.  All you need do is follow the instructions in the 
Bentley.  By the way, Bentley will tell you that the entire door has to come 
off in order to remove and replace the SHLA.  Not so.  And NOT removing the 
door saves a lot of effort.

Likely that you are dead-on with your assessment of the situation.  The 
plastic slider block has given up the ghost and is allowing the SHLA to 
wander around.  Probably just fixing the SHLA by replacing the plastic block 
is all you really need.  But.........(you knew that was coming, right?) as 
long as you are going to remove the SHLA from the body, you might just as 
well check it over, clean it thoroughly (it will need it, trust me), and lube 
it.

Yes, you can get replacements for the SHLA at boneyards.  Be sure to specify 
your year of manufacture.  The design did change somewhat in '75 (I think).  
Expect to fork out $50 for a replacement plus shipping.  You might want to 
try Way-Out Salvage.

I did the very job you are now contemplating.  Took a couple of hours and I'm 
a slow worker.  I bought a replacement SHLA, but did not use it.  Instead I 
took the best pieces from the replacement and the best pieces from my 
existing SHLA and put together a "new " one.  Functions beautifully.
