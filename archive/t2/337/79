You could ask TRW about this.. They used to make after market productions of
things like that. They fell back on auto parts production when
aerospace/defense was slow. But they recently spun that operation off and
sold it to another company. They're about the only ones who would have the
capability. In the mean time, it might be a good idea to look around the
junk yards to find whatever you can and keep it for future use if you really
want to keep your vehicle running.
