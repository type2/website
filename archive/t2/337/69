Here's a good picture that Steve Dolan sent me:

Also, Scott Lyons <slyons(-at-)netrover.com> points out this installation
problem...

The other issue with that sender is that the case thru bolt near the sender
(top rear one) must be facing the right way for the sender to fit. I found
this out the hard way. The bolt heads must be on the 3-4 side of the case.
If the bolts are installed pointing the other direction, the tip of the bolt
will want to interfere with the sender.
