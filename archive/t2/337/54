I'm not completely sure, but doesn't the cht gauge simply read the
changes of resistance between 2 wires? If this is infact true (do
check w/ someone more knowledagable) then could you hook up a vom to
it to at least decide if the gauge is reading what it thinks is
correct or not. if you get nice steady readings on the vom then I
guess the gauge might be suspect.
