Subject: Bus Wanted in BC

Hey all-
While I have gotten my "free" bus up and running, and am having fun cruising
around, I have come to accept that due to what my brother refers to as her
"impressive state of decomposition", she is probably not the going to be the
best long term daily driver for me. Does anyone have any good leads on good
busses for sale in southern BC?
Thanks!
Cheers,
Matthew
