not how I tightened them (air gun at a shop) so I'm going to recheck the

torque once a week until I'm satisfied that the torque remains sufficient.

I have a feeling that this will happen again.

PITA that it is, you might consider pulling the rear drums to check
if the studs are loose/turning in the drums.
Left field guess: are the stud holes in your wheels worn to the point
of letting the nuts press against the drum instead of pushing the
wheel against the drum...? I had a wheel that was left loose by a 
tire repair shop and the hubcap slapped back on. It only took a 
couple of blocks to loosen entirely and wobble wear the holes in the
wheel to complete uselessness...
