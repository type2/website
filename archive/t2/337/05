CV Joint bolts-28 ft-lbs-no serrated or other lock washers per VW Service
bulletin.



I got this from the list a year or so ago. Apparently VW superseded the lock
washers and changed the torque value. If anyone knows for sure, I'd be
grateful, since I'm doing my CV's soon.

I've reused these, along with their matching plates, with no problems.
