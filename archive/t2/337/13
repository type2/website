"No more old europe pomme frittes for me.
Im well stocked with FREEDOM FRIES(tm)"

You American imperialistic cowboys are disgusting.  Freedom Fries!  They aren't french anyway.  We protest places that serve "French" Fries.  They are no french. 

These are also disgusting:

You cowboys think that if our foreign policy is not driven by oil, we are cowards or fools.  Our foreign policy is based on enlightened thinking.  We support only countries that place a high priority on human rights, like Iraq.  We don't allow our economic concerns, like our contracts with the Iraqis to produce oil and our longtime contracts to supply planes, tanks, and missiles to Iraq, to influence our policy.  

You think only of oil.  That is why you cowboys support Isreal and anger the Arab oil producing countries.
