Subject: Wobbly rear tires.

Wife was following me home this evening and noticed that the rear tires
seemed to be "wobbling" upon closer inspection the right rear tire had a
lug nut loose. She says the left tire is far worse then the right.

Now I'm sure I tightened the hell out of these when I did the brakes last.
Any ideas?
