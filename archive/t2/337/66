Subject: Re: [T2] Oil pressure sender

I have a '77 and I didn't order the extension (I assume you're talking about
the VDO sender).  All I had to do was use a Dremel tool grinder to slightly
enlarge the original hole in the engine tin and trim off a tiny bit of the
oil cooler tin (I did it this afternoon in fact).  Took about 20 minutes, so
I guess it all depends on what your time is worth.  The sender does seem to
make a snug fit for the dizzy, but I think I'll still have room to twist it
for timing.
