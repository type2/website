OK folks, some people have decided that it is a cool thing to subscribe
under a different address and either troll or flame.

Be advised, if you do this and our very capable list gurus figure out who
you are (and it isn't as difficult as you might think), you will find
yourself banned from the list from all your addresses.  No second chances.
