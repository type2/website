Cheap shot and uncalled-for by someone who does know or has not seen my
work. Yes, the builder is at least 50% of the equation with regard to engine
life. The rest is quality of parts and workmanship done by the machinist on
those parts. If I was willing to accept poor quality it would not have taken
me at least 6 months just to gather most of the parts together. How many
standard cases have you found that meet factory specifications? If you have
one I will certainly buy it!

I have returned three sets of Kolbenschmidt  main bearings because they were
packed wrong and damaged in shipping. I have received a poor quality
camshaft from a major VW supplier and returned that. A reputable engine
builder has ruined one of my best cases with a sloppy line bore (0.002
oversized main bores). Very little quality control in this business.

Know of any builder who will offer a decent warranty on their work? That is
why I do all my own work. I am better than any builder as I will use what I
am building and hence will be super anal about the quality and workmanship
going into it.

But the quality of one of the major parts is important and will effect
engine life. And what do we do when they degrade past economical
refurbishment? I can have Boston Engine align bore my case for $150.
Additional work to correct whatever additional problems I find will run at
least $50 an hour. As long as someone like Bob stays in the business we are
fine. But wouldn't you like to have the option of new parts if available? It
would save on the hassle of finding good oversized bearings, finding a
reputable machine shop, etc.
