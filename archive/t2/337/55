I believe so...

While on the subject, does anyone know anything about the CHT sender that 
can be screwed in to a 1600DP head.  I believe these were used on the FI 
Type-3's, but I have one of these heads, and a sender (not currently 
installed) and was considering hooking it up if I can figure out what the 
calibration curve for it is.  If not, I guess I'll just default to ye olde 
experimental method...

Ah!  Just the excuse I needed to get a phat voltmeter.  :)
