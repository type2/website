  Anyway, I'm wondering what the standard protocol for fall back is with
 these.  Do I carry a spare distributor, all set up to go?  Or what?
 I've been in the habit of keeping a few spare sets of points around.
 What goes bad on the Hall Unit?

I am assuming you have a California version Vanagon?

If yes, the only failure I have had with the factory electronic ignition has been the coil. The standard point
coil is not the correct one. The electronic ignition coil is different.

A weak point in the system is the wiring harness where it connects to the distributor. The insulation falls
apart inside the rubber plug and the wires touch each other.

The modules and distributors themselves are darn near bullet proof. The vacuum units go bad, same as they do
in point style dizzys.
