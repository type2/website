Subject: CHT gauge weirdness

Volks,

I've got some weirdness going on with my CHT gauge that I'd be interested 
to hear if anyone has encountered before.

To wit, the gauge alternately:
	a) reads what appears to be a reasonable temperature
	b) flutters between ~170 and ~325, staying mostly on the ~170 side
	c) reads low: around 160-200

This sounds like a sender (or wire) problem, but it's not like the sender 
is all that complex.  I've checked the connections, and they all seem good 
and tight, so I'm curious what's going on.

Thoughts?

Does this definitely seem like a sender/connectivity problem as opposed to 
a gauge problem?

thanks,
	tom
