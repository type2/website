Subject: Re: [T2] Future of the type IV engine?

The availability of brand new type 1 engines, cases and heads is one of the
factors that led me to buy a 1970 bus.  I accept the deficient power, speed
and longevity as an acceptable trade off.

Will we need to convert to type I engines, similar to the Brazilian
transporters? Can we interest someone into reverse engineering a type IV
case or buying the molds from VW and supplying new castings? I certainly
would be willing to spend about $700 for a new case.

I am interested in hearing from the community and your opinions.
