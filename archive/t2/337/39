If it's any help, my `77 came with a side door that wouldn't open.  I
finally figured out that the slider mech was frozen.

After an interesting time of trying to figure out how to remove the mech
with the door not opening, I got it out and discovered that the arm was
rusted enough to lock it into the sliding part of the mech.  Much WD40 and a
little propane torch teasing to expand the slider, I got it apart and
repaired.  Door slides nicely, now.

What I discovered was that you can still close and latch the door, driving
safely with the door securely closed, BUT REMEMBER that the door has no
slider!  Keep it closed and locked until you're able to repair/replace the
mech.
