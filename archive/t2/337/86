Theoretically you are right. But in practice most of the type IV engines I
have seen for the heavier buses/ Vanagons have been overheated at some point
in their life and have elongated bores. Now admittedly my sampling is small,
but this theory is born out by my communication with machine shops that work
on the type IV's and my search for a case in good shape that will meet
specification for standard bearings (pmail if you want all their names and
responses). All the shops have align bored cases available, but nothing
provably in standard bore. What happened to all those bulletproof cases? All
on the road?

My point is that at some point regardless of the quality of work done by the
assembler or the additional parts, we run into the problem that the source of
good used cases will run out. What machine shop does the following on a
routine basis to provide a case at factory specification (or better):

Why should we accept second rate parts and what can we do about it?
