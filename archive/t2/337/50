Subject: handcontrols

I drove a lincoln towncar with hand controls for a rental car company I worked for once. It was a shaft with a handle that you pushed for brakes and rotated for acceleration.

But you could do both at the same time!

I almost plowed that thing into the back of a semi when I forgot and reversed upon freezing.

No certification.
