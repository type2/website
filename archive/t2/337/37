My wife drives what we call the "Urban Assault Volkswagen" which is mostly
surface rust and oxidized red paint.  Mechancally, it's perfect, but from
the outside it is, shall we say, ratty.

We use this when we have to go to the Big City, as it is less likely to be
stolen than our bus.

One time we ended up at a ritzy restaurant, and decided to risk letting
the valet park the bug.  I carefully instructed him on how to find reverse
and let him go.

When we came out, our poor little bug was parked in "display row" right
between a Ferrari and a Bentley.  I suppose that the valets were having
their little joke!
