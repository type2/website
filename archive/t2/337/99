Jon,

I don't use a gauge(yet), but one of the first things I do when I
buy a vw is hook up a piezeo-buzzer from radio shack to the stock
oil warning light circuit....it makes me feel far safer to know
that I will get an audible warning signal as well as a visual
one if the pressure drops.

Still works even if the light is out too!

Cheers, dave
