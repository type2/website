Yes, a lot easier if you don't remove the entire door.  Almost closed, the
door will support itself.  Open, I had a short length of a 4" x 4" timber
that held the door up by its bottom edge.

It's also a good time to clean and lube the top and bottom tracks, and the
arms on the door that move in them.
