Subject: More VW schtuff for sale

Like a gift that keeps on giving....

still got an engine case from an 81 Vanagon.
Dash items, steering wheel, istruments, etc  from a Vangon.
Used half shafts from the vanagon, I think they are the same as the loafs.

New Front brake pads for Type III, and 411 and 412s
New master Cylinder for a Type I

I have a ton of watercooled struts and brake parts for VW/Audi. I know some 
of you deviants own newer watercooled VWs, so drop me an e-mail on that stuff.

The brake pads and Master cylinder will be mostly free. just pay shipping.
Dead inventory I told my dad I'd find a new home for :)

have a good weekend
