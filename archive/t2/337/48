- Buttons of just about any color, including colored translucents.
Could you make one with an Apple logo on it? I have the top cover off of an
apple ibook power supply that might just fit.
- Button with a phone jack in the center with the word "Network" just above
it.
While I wouldn't want a network tap in my horn, I could use one in the dash,
and one in the rear.  I tend to take my laptops with me when I'm on the
road. 
- Button with a grounded 120 volt (or European) receptacle in the center.
I already have the 120 on the dash, I could use a European.
- Button with camera lens centered in it (for Mulders everywhere, "They're
watching you.")
My neighbor tried to convince me to mount a fake camera lens on the
windshield wiper fluid cap.  HE said that it's location near the passenger
floor in my 77 bay would scare hitchhikers.
- Button with tiny spikes for those who need a gentle reminder to lay off
the horn...
Why not one big nasty looking spike?
