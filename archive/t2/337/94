Subject: No Heater Boxes...Safe?

Short reply: Yes. Long Reply: You are going to need at least the fan in the 
engine compartment, and a way to vent its output into the BA-6. That's the 
problem with the BA series of heaters. They are "supplemental"/"dependant" 
to/on the existing heating system and use many of its components. The BN 
series were "stand Alone" units and could be used by themselves without the 
incorporation of existing vehicle heating systems. Good luck, as many of the 
BA-6 safety systems depend on having a fully functionally stock heating 
system in place. My advice...Sell the BA-6 and install a BN-4. Much easier 
install, much more reliable.

<So, im ready to tackle the BA6 install project, which will hopefully
both give me heat and eliminate any exhausty smells from coming into the
cabin. My wife is rather sensitive about those smells, so I was planning
in just removing the old heater system, since it wont even channel into
the bus anymore. 

But, does it serve another use? Can I get rid of that fan in the engine
compartment, and those two hoses, or is that not a good idea? 

And what about the heater boxes, will I need them anymore, for
non-heating use? 

Thanks for any input. >
