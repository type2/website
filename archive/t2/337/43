there is no such certification that I'm aware of, trick question

however all hand controls don't work the same way, unlike cars with gas on
right, brake in the middle and clutch on the left, and all pushed
down.  there are several varients of hand controls...ask the poor valet at
the DC Shereton who took out the canopy, 3 cars and a limo, not to mention
sending two to the hospital when he mistook the gas for the brake :8*(-at-)

and while the Bug is very easy to put hand controls in, the bus is very
hard (manitory bus content)
