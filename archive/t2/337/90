Subject: back up light woes

Hello fellow listees!
I need your help. In brief:
The back up lights on my 78 westy (manual tranny) do
not work. I have checked the fuse, I have checked the
bulbs, I have about 11V available at the back up light
switch on the tranny. My question is this: is there a
way to test the switch to see if it is bad? The
obvious answer lies in front of us all. 11V at the
input, put van in reverse with clutch depressed, put
voltmeter at the output of the switch, see if 11V out.
I was wondering if there was a way to test the switch
without having to climb under the van while it is in
reverse. (Just seems dangerous to me.)

Please help. Thanks.
Matt
