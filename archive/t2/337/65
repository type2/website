<sigh> well I dont know how I'm going to start my mornings without my coffee
and reading about the newest trials and tribulations of you guys, but you're
a wordy bunch and as I'm headed to SoCal for 4 weeks or more, I'm afraid my
computor would be smokin when I got home. So I'll have to sign off for a
while. Keep the greasy side down!
