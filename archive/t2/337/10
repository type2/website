Ted,

I was afraid of that...It's just that we have had 
19" of show *in February* and our normal is 2.7" here
in Northwest Arkansas.  Shoot, when it finally got up to
32 degrees 4 days ago, people thought we were having
a heat wave and started wearing t-shits<grin>.

This is our first sunshine and "normal" temperature
in what seems like 3 weeks and I gotta tell ya, that
it is long overdue for us.

Your time *will* come.

Cheers, dave
