Subject: RE: [T2] Window Regulator R&R

Removing the window regulator goes as follows for the backyard mechanic
that I am:

1. Remove door handle facing (one screw that you can see when you pull
the handle out) and the door pull (if applicable).
2. Pry off door panel and inner plastic if it has one. 
3. Remove all bolts one the regulator (2(-at-)bottom of door,2(-at-)window (rest
window in the bottom of door) 2(-at-)curve of regulator, 2(-at-) winder) and the
bottom bolt of the vent window bracket.
4. Here's the hard part-- you must lower the regulator thru where the
window bracket and the door connect i.e. where the window bracket is
bolted to the door). I usually stick a big screwdriver thru the oval
slot next to the bolt hole and pry it open gently.
5. Wiggle the regulator (hint: the drain tube is highly flexible)

Installation is the reverse (including the screwdriver to separate the
vent wing bracket joint).

Let me know if you have any problems. TBear
