I used to think so as well. My original seal died in 1989 and the replacement died long before I replace it in 2002 but both of those fit. At that time I put in a 3rd seal and it came unwrapped in the shipping box from a favorite online vendor and it ended up being short. I made inquiries and was told they were all the same length.

Jump forward to May of this year when I decided to replace the seal again because I was dissatisifed with the fit of the last one (I had to put in a piece of the old stuff) and I had the engine out for the flywheel seal leak anyway. The new seal came from GoWesty! and came sealed in a bag from the German manufacturer. Perfect fit.

I don't think the other vendors buy a large reel of engine seal and cut off a piece to sell but from my limited experience it either appears that way or the factory frequently makes mistakes.
