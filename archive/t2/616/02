Subject: RE: [T2] AIRS UPDATES: An new idea

Folks,

Might be as easy as adding a field to the original form with a 
"signed-up date" or "updated on date" field.

If I had such a list and some entries were 5 years old and some were done 
yesterday, guess which I would call first....

Just another idea.
If someone can add that to the form now and have just an empty place
for the data for people that are already on...you get the idea...


Cheers, dave
