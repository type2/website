Hello Guys           This is right to an extent , but some of the 
improvements aren't  better on the bays than the splits   I have up graded all my splits 
with the dual master clys. I have been using a standard beetle master cly cost 
new about $30.00 ( some will say that this cly is too small but they have 
been working great for me for about 10 years aand using either a resevior from a 
rabbit or volvo 240 the fill hole lines up perfectly) ,  also when was the 
last time you saw a split front axle rust away or worse break at the center pin 
like the bays do.  Have you ever seen a link pin break like the ball joints 
will.??  How about the trannys, the bays have problems with the ring and 
pinions,and the shifter selectors in the nosecones that doesn't occur in the splits,  
How about the motors  type 4 produces more power but has built in leaks, bad 
exhust design, valve seats that tend to come out, bad design at the pick-up 
tube, and a lot heavier and cost more to repair. The bottom end is very tough in 
the type 4 . I like them both but I do drive splitties and have been since 
1971     later and have fun  Mark Dearing    Salem Import Service  salem va
