Subject: hello and some resto buses or sale

hey bus go'ers,

HELLO:
I just wanted to send a shout out to the list. I have had my hands full back
in the swing of things. The shop has life again. We had our best month in 4
years. Thanks for everyone out there buying there bus parts from
mitchellmotorwoks.com aka bustedbus.com. I cannot say how thankfull I am. As
well thanks to Mike Hanson and Tyler Travis for taking orders and shipping
parts. They are off this weekend to Jerome and a much needed vacation for
Tyler next week too so expect to talk to me on the phones and email.

BUSES:
I have a few buses for sale on TheSamba.com which can be reached from links on
our home page (bottom). These are buses that are in need of some love but, I
cannot find it in my hart to part them. So take a look they are all resto
worthy and priced to sell.
