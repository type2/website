Up until a month ago, I too have never heard of the pop rivet in the
throttle plate.

My 56 Beetle came with a 009/34 PICT 3 set up and I wasn't happy with the
way it worked, it idled OK (not great), but hesitated and had flat spots in
acceleration. It was timed properly for having a 009 distributor,
http://www.type2.com/library/electrip/bosch009.htm  so I thought maybe the
carb needed cleaning so I took it off. That's when I discovering the pop
rivet (WHAT THE HELL!) in the throttle plate. I searched the internet and
found that only the following articles had any mention of the pop rivet:

http://www.w-p-c.com/buggy2.htm

http://www.bostonengine.com/articles/009.html

I drilled out the pop rivet and cleaned the carb (I also discovered that the
main jet is a135 and not a 127.5) and put it back on. It worked a little
worse and I noticed that I had to turn the idle screw in alot to bring down
the idle, so the pop rivet actually did something.
I bought a new vacuum advanced distributor timed to 5 degrees ATDC, and now
it works great. No more hesitation or flat spots.

I'll put a 127.5 main jet back in as soon as I get a stock exhaust.

I'd say KEEP IT STOCK!
