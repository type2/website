Subject: Need help with Bentley carburetor jet specs

I am trying to interpret the jet sizes given in the carb technical data tables
in Bentley chap 3 section 8. Some sizes are just plain numbers, while other
sizes have a letter prefix or suffix. The main jet sizes are given with values
like X125 which I understand means 1.125 mm. Some of the other jet sizes are
specified with numbers like 60Z, g57.5, and 147.5. How are these last three
values interpreted?

Sincere Thanks,
