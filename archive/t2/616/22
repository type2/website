Maybe what we need to do is make people's AIRS listings something they have 
to renew annually. Set up the list server so that it sends an automated mail 
a few weeks before expiration with instructions to reply to the email to 
renew. Otherwise the person is automatically dropped.

What I see happening is the list dropping from thousands of members to a 
handful judging by the list volume. Is this good or bad? On the one hand, 
you would only have those who were currently still active with VW's. On the 
other hand, you might drop those who while not still in the VW scene, might 
be more than glad to help someone in an emergency.
