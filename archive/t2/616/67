Subject: Re: [T2] Sunroof drain

My 74 has a sunroof with no seal as well. They sell for $200+. I bought a 4'
x 2' piece of magnetic material at a local sign shop ($40CDN) it came in
white, which is the color as the roof. I cut it into 4" strips and voila, no
more rain in the bus, and I can still open the sunroof. I had the bus doing
75 mph and the magnetic strips stayed put. I left a few small gaps for air
circulation.
