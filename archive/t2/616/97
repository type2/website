Subject: Bay Window vs. Splitty

I find the splits to be one of the most aesthetically pleasing vehicles on 
the road. I also find the type 1 engine easier to deal with, though early 
bays are available with them. That having been said, I find myself 
preferring the bay because of better visibility at the front window while 
sight-seeing, and liking to hang my arm out the window while touring, and 
lower prices on parts. I think you got hosed on the brakes. I don't find 
splittie brake prices any lower than bay.
