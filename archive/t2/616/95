Don,

We beat this one to death over on the vintage vw list several years ago.

The folks over there believe that it doesn't help....I just can't believe 
it though cause when doing air/conditioner tests many years ago, condenser 
efficency goes waaaay up when the humidity is higher...especially when 
raining.


On the other hand, I have seen people on this list with lots of 
instrumentation (and a 911) owner talk about their CHT and oil temps
actually going **up** when it is raining.

Makes no sense to me...I am in the more humidty better cooling camp.


Cheers, dave
