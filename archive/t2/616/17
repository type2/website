Ok.  Well, it's been a while since I've had time to work on this 
project, my aux battery charging circuit still being disconnected all 
these months later.

It's time I got back to working on it, since I'm hoping to take a 
couple of major trips in the Bus this winter.

So, I still need to know precisely where the signal lead for the 
isolator relay is supposed to connect.  I have had people tell me "the 
alternator" ... which is not very helpful :-)  There's no obvious 
connection point for it on the alternator, all of the wires coming from 
the alternator are wrapped in a protective harness, and the lead isn't 
long enough to reach, which makes me think it was originally connected 
somewhere in the engine compartment, possibly somewhere on the voltage 
regulator (please don't give me a terminal # ... I seem to not have a 
stock Bosch regulator).

Now, a picture is worth a thousand words :-)  Would someone be willing 
to snap a photo of their properly-wired-up stock Westy aux battery 
charging circuit?  Specifically, the isolator relay signal lead's 
connection to "whatever provides its +12v when the engine is running" 
:-)
