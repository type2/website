Don,

My experience with the foam seals has been the same as yours.

I did see a later post where Richard said the ones from gowesty fit 
right...maybe Ron or some of the other suppliers can jump on this one?
I have *never* had one long enough....from at least two different 
suppliers.


Plug seals... I always grab my trusty tube of yellow 3m weatherstrip 
glue and figure out where the seals push down on the insulators to seal 
best and glue them in....maybe pushing them down just a little further to
make sure they seal around the sheet metal.

I figure, why work so hard to seal the rest of the engine and then leave 
that part to chance...the amount of cooling air that can come out of a bad 
plug seal is amazing!

Cheers, dave
