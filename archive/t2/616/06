Subject: Re: [T2] AIRS UPDATES: An new idea

Hi All,

Ok, Don and I have begun to spec out what the update to the AIRS site 
should include.
I'd like to ask for input from everyone before starting so that I can at 
least build a framework that includes the ability for future updates.

I'm off to Atlanta, GA. tomorrow and get back on Tues., so I can start then!

Oh, btw... Anyone know of junkyards in Atlanta that I can visit?

Thanks,
Harry
