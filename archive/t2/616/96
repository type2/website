Well, seat of the pants tested out well. Ran stronger all the way to
work doing 60-ish on the 5. About 5 miles.

I'm absolutely certain I'm going to need to adjust the valves again.
:( The obvious overheating I was feeling prior to installing the seal
means bad things. I just hope the valve seat didn't sink TOO far.
