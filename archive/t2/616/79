I put the smooth side down as well, however I was told (and saw a friend's)
who had the smooth side up.  Their explanation was the rough side had a heat
shield therefore it should go down towards the heat?  I liked the way the
rough side looked against my new Dove Blue paint, so mine was done with
smoothy side down.  Can I hear an Amen?
