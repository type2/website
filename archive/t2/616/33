Subject: Re: [T2] No oil pressure! Pump?

Hello Paul  I had a motor recently that did the same thing turned out to be a 
bad oil filter.  take the filter off and crank the motor over and see if oil 
comes out . If not then squirt oil into the oil holes in the block and repeat 
. last take off the pick=up screen and make sure it is clear. Be careful 
retightening the nut on the screen if you over torque it you can break the case 
where the pick-up tube bolts. If all this checks out then it most likely will be 
the pump  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
