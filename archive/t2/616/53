Subject: Re: [T2] Front Brake Pads

Some brake pads are made from harder material than others. Both pads will stop the vehicle safely. Over time the harder pads will leave more metalic brake dust on your rims and will wear out your rotors faster. I've seen this on too many other cars. I don't want anyone to think that I base my brake part buying decisions on price. I just know there are a lot of options out there for brake pads for the bus. Some better than others...

Not to mention the rest of us out there sharing the road with ya!
