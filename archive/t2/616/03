Subject: seat padding for vanagon

hello,

I have an aircooled 81 vanagon, and I used to be able to find replacement 
seat padding for my old baywindow busses no problem, but just dont see any 
for the Vanagon listed anywhere, am I on my own, just needing to get in 
touch with an uphostery shop to get some generic stuff and cut it as needed?

any personal experience with this?
