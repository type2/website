Subject: Airs Update

I've taken the liberty of installing a trial copy of "Webdata" set up
for AIRS purposes at:

http://www.volks-web.org/AIRS/

First, go to AIRS_instantmember.html.  Choose a username and password,
then add your airs info.

Go back to the main page, choose airs form to search and display the db,
or members to edit your info.

This is meant as a demo only, however, if folx chipped in for the
license fee ($200), I'd be glad to host it and make it prettier.

The trial is 30 days.  You can get more info on webdata at:
