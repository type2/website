Subject: {t2} Airs Updates

I have to agree on some type of expiration date.  I checked my listing a few
weeks ago and it had my old phone, and my old address.  I just never thought
about changing it when I moved 5 years ago.

the VW scene, might be more than glad to help someone in an emergency.

I agree. But maybe we could try to contact the people that don't
respond to Email via phone, or vice verse. That way if their still
available to help AC's then we'll be able to contact 'em. And if their
non-contactable, then their no good on the list.

Maybe we could set up a script so that when an account expires after a
year or whatever, it's mailed to someone who can then phone the number
on the expired account and see if they wanted to let it expire, or if
they want to renew. I would be more than happy to be the guy who calls
expired accounts in Washington State. Maybe even the greater
NorthWest.
