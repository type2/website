My mother-in-law drives an Element.  They like to hike in the hills 
around the San Fernando Valley or in the Malibu Canyon with their two 
dogs, and she volunteers for a wildlife rescue center and sometimes has 
to haul crated animals ... good vehicle for that... you can pretty much 
just hose them out if you have to!  It also manages her commute (from 
the west end of the Valley to the east end of the Valley ... and 
traffic on the Ventura Freeway can be quite maddening :-) quite well 
because it drives nicely, has unobstructed views of the surroundings, 
is comfortable to sit in, and has a Aux Input jack on the stereo 
suitable for iPod.  It was also a good vehicle for driving her mother 
around while she was recovering from hip surgery -- very easy to get in 
and out of.

I've driven it a few times, and I like it.

I still like my Bus more, though :-)
