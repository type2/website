Subject: friday question for the chemical engineers

Folks,

Imagine this...my Mom and I have similar cars from a non-vw manufacturer.

Mine is a Hi-performance 6 cyl and hers is a 4 cylinder.

Mine says 93 octane only while hers says 

DO NOT use anything other than 87 octane.

Why???

Bus content: what do most people use in their bus...t1 or t4 and why.

Cheers, dave
