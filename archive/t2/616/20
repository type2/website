Subject: Was  No new Type II now I'm paying the price.

OK so I'll never rant again. Here's why:

I get home from work and decide HAL needs a real good bath, she's
filthy. The underside is covered with month old mud from a construction
site down the street that has spilled out into the street.

As I'm washing her down and spraying under the wheel wells my karma
catches up with me. I hear a popping noise and smoke starts bellowing
out from the right rear side of my bus. 

I see it two ways: One I toasted my hard start relay and my karma isn't
quite as bad as I thought or Two: I fried my less than month old starter
and I'm on a downward spiral I'll be lucky to get out of. Heck...I don't
even believe in karma. I guess I'll let things dry out and crawl under
to see how much trouble I'm in.

So I'll never whine again...sorry

up WASHING it before)
