 i use later bentley for this stuff... like a 70s beetle one... you have to 
remove the generator, take the fan off it, take the plates at the fan end off, 
and then undo the two long machine screws (slotted head).  then you can pull 
the cover off, move the center long thingy,  and then pull the bearing off the 
shaft.  might as well polish up the commuator while it's easy to get to.  

before installing the gen, test it by the using the polarisation method as 
per bentley.  if it spins, it should be happy.
