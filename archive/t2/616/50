I can acknowledge that.  My wife and I broke down and bought a new car
after driving an aircooled beetle and bus for many years.  We didn't buy a
NB because it wasn't utilitarian.  We considered a PT, but the build
quality was horrible.  We ended up with a Scion xB, (the New Freidolin)
which, despite the advertising, is very utilitarian.

It seems that the auto manufacturers have mostly forgotten that some US
customers want cars to use, not to be rolling fashion statements.  The
only reason that the US got the xB was that Toyota wanted a cheap way to
compete with the Honda Element.  They switched their domestic market
utility bB to LHD and brought it over.

I don't think that VW (at least in the us) is capable of thinking in these
terms any longer.  I guess I'll just have to get another 30 years out of
my '71!
