while i agree that the harder pads will wear the rotors out faster i was
under the impression that the softer pads leave more brake dust on the
rims??? (can anyone confirm this)

also, in response to the original post - pads lasting only 8K could be
chalked up to the towing & steep grade driving that was mentioned. keep in
mind those are pretty small pads for a heavy vehicle.

as far as the Pagid brand, i have put those on my father & brother's BMWs.
they seem to be holding up well, but i don't have any long-term data.
