As far as fabricating a shelf: pop-rivet another one on, or even wood screws
(in a pinch!).
The oil bath air filter should have some clips on it to secure the top of it
to the oil bath part -- there should also be more of the same kind of clips
to secure the whole thing to the shelf. The clips hang underneath the shelf,
then you end up locking it in in a fulcrum/lever action.
Though a hanging filter is exotic, it would create one heluva mess if it
ever fell down! Good luck ~~~
