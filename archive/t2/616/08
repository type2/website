Hey Josh,

Yep, that's exactly what I was planning on. I'm already working on the 
database.

And yeah, I'll do away with the frames. I certainly wont turn down any 
help  :-) 

The user table currently contains a
uid (unique), givenname, surname, password, createddate, lastmodified

The preferences table will cover most of the other stuff on the webpage
beer preference, engine types, etc.

Cheers,
Harry
