Subject: Foam Seal Questions

Ok, I gave up. Driving the bus home in this heat (cooler than the last
week or so though!) the power started fading off. :-( I was waiting
for a seal from another list member (he's at Jerome), but I need to
drive the bus to work.

I went ahead and cracked the piggy bank for a foam seal. The duct tape
wasn't cutting it. $30 at vwparts.net (fairly local to me so I went to
the store front). I picked up some proper muffler gaskets, aluminum
clad, while I was there since the crappy paper ones that came with my
Empi muffler have already disintegrated.

Anyway, my questions:

Foam seal has a smooth side and a rough side. I'm guessing  smooth side down?

Where should the ends meet? I'm thinking at the far back top since
that will have the coolest air when moving. Is that correct?
