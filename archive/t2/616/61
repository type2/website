The Eurovan wouldn't work as a Microbus-whatever anyway.
They're all around here, and they're so boring.  Good
vans, yes, market leaders too, but ... *yawn*.

Eurovan-based, Polish-made T5 Transporter.  As can be
found by the dozen in any German VW dealership.  About
as appealing as a forklift.

Which is what it is.  The Sprinter/LT is even more
ulitarian and boring than the T5.  And also much, much
bigger.  Not really what I'd want to make a Microbus
out of.

Did you see the new Vito?  *shudder*  There's a new
definition of ugliness.  Begins with a V, ends with
an o.

Wild guess: Next Passat.  Transversal engine, lots
of wheelbase and width, mass produced and hence not
too expensive.  I wouldn't be surprised at all if
that's going to be the foundation for the next Sharan,
and also for a version with altered design that's
going to be the Microbus.  But I repeat, this is a
wild guess.

Hm.  Let's hope you're wrong then.  The Touareg isn't
all that spacious inside, it's only big from the outside.
(Like most SUVs in fact.)

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
