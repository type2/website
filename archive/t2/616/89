Ill second that. It worked well for me. Get the "waterproof" neoprene seat 
covers and put a square of carpet (I used a spare piece from recarpeting 
the cargo area, it doesn't have to be thick) between it and the seat. Did 
the same thing with the back seat using a pickup truck bench seat cover. 
Just tie it down really well or the pup will slide around when you hit the 
brakes or turn.

But he still wants to sit on my sheepskin cover whenever he can.
