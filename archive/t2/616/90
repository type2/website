Subject: Re: [T2] Foam Seal Questions & plug seals

Superior plug seal is the Corvair plug seal. Google for "Corvair vendor" or "Corvair parts". If the supplier you choose does not offer a catalog, they are just a reseller. Get to the source... 

Page 76 of the Clark's Corvair parts catalog. Again Google is your friend... 

See ya!
