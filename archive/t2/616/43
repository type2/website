I respond: Be aware that the new Solex 34Pict3 carbs are not jetted correctly for the bus. You may have an original carb w/ original jets in which case this doesn't apply. If you have a non-original replacement carb, check the jets. On new carbs, the AC jet is too large which leans out the mixture (hot running). People compensate for this w/ a larger main jet. Best alternative would be to use the original size AC jet, but I can't find one. Bentley and W/o Guesswork have all the jet sizes. If you are running a 34Pict3 Carb on a 1600DP motor in a bus, that equates to a 1971 bus. Also be aware that the stock bus distributor had a different advance curve than the bug distributors -- I am not specifically aware of any replacement carb that has the correct curve, but it may be out there. I cannot state how big a deal the bus-specific advance curve is, but, as has been observed many times on this list, VW engineers were not in the habit of designing new parts when the old one would 
do fine....
