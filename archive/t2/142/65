huh???  78 has hyd lifters, should make no noise ever, after startup oil
presure build up.   can't figure out how a pinging noise could be from
cam?
   only time my 78 pinged was with low octane gas, advance set wrong, or
something rattling somewhere.
so now I make sure I put 89 octane in it and check the timing advance
regularly.

now if I could find all the dang rattles and stop em  ;8*?
