Thanks for the reference - Here's a direct link:

Hmmm... interesting reading, but I take issue with some of his conclusions, 
such as where he states that more weight on the pulley end equalizes weight 
and "stops crank twist".  Like every other statement on that page, it has 
no hard data to back it up, just a reference to "good common sense".  I 
also notice that he says there is no need for the heavy pulley with a stock 
engine, which I certainly believe.

How's this for a scientific proof:

"The light pulley allows the nodes (vibration like a guitar string) to 
travel up the crank from the pulley end to the flywheel end of the 
crankshaft. Naturally, the flywheel stops this node at that point 
transferring it into the case. By adding the extra weight to the pulley end 
with our heavy pulley it stops this from occurring, no longer being sent to 
the flywheel end."

I know, who am I to dump on Gene Berg like that?  Maybe his stuff really is 
good - I can't say, but I've had enough education to be offended by the 
above paragraph, not to mention his disclaimer about 72-and-up US-spec 
busses which he won't touch with a ten-foot pole.

Here's a post I found on dejanews.com.  Tried to verify it on Gene Berg's 
web site but couldn't find anything recommending GL-5 oil.  I see I also 
disagree with him on the use of synthetic oil.  Finally, Gene Berg seems to 
think that the 009 is the cat's meow.  I guess I just don't understand his 
philosophy.
