When I bought my first VW (type I) in the 80s, the .009 was touted
as a "High Performance" by the ads in the VW rags, as well as by
friends and such.  I seem to remember the .009 being a desirable
dizzy at the time.  My VW friends at the time (as well as myself)=20
believed whatever the mags said, we were just young teenagers on
the east coast in a small town with no VW shops to gleen knowledge
from, and of course there were no email lists.  It wasn't until the
early 90s that I joined a type I email list and first heard bad things
about the .009.

Hmm, last time I picked these parts up for my type I, the FLAPS guy
didn't ask me what dizzy I had, I just assumed these parts must
be interchangable (I have vacuum advance on a 1500 SP engine.)  Do
I have the wrong parts installed? It seems to run fine, and the parts
weren't pricey.
