back hen i was a VW newbie, i had bought my westfalia 1973 and had a =
type 4
engine with dual solex..ect.ect, when i start having problem one of my =
first
move was to change the dizzy to a 009, simple and available  for me.

Now since a few year, im back with my vacuum SVDA distributor, i have 2 =
of
them and i had rebuilt them and happy, my 009 sit in a box but are =
available
for emergency  i brought one with me when i go on long trip.  I also =
have a
type 1 engine and also on Vacuum Distributor,  i feel they give a =
smoother
drive with a westfy full load in a hill than a 009.

Also when you go to a vw shop for engine trouble, they seems to always =
want
to switch the Vacuum with a 009...

009s are available new, and parts are readily available too.

However, check the advance curve of those 10 009s and you'll get 8 =
different
curves! Quality control sucks on them, they are not the same old German =
009s
available 20 years ago.

009s also do not have the #3 retard that is nice on early engines
(pre-doghouse). Most of the reasons for the prevalence of the 009 is =
monkey
see-monkey do.

When you consider the facts, there is no reason to use the 009 since =
there
are other better options out there, but the 009 is available new (so it
"must" be good) and it's cheap.
