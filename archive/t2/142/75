Subject: long...Re: [T2] Tranny bushings, linkages, adjustments?

Beth,

Did this about 2 months ago when I did the engine pull for the gas tank 
problems....you know....while you have it out, you might as well do it 
all<grin>.

Here is what I did(and learned).

Mine is a stock manual trans 78 2.0l as well.

You have 2 rods that go from the front of the shifter to the back.
The front is connected to your shifter...about 2-3 feet back is a coupler 
to the "rear" rod which is about 7-8' long and connects to the trans thru 
another coupler.

There is a small round "ring" looking bushing at the front of the front 
rod.  Next should be a rubber bellows that goes around the tube that the 
rear rod is supported in by the 3(yes 3!) plastic bushings inside the tube 
that support the rear rod.  At the rear(engine side) of the shift rod is 
another bellows that goes around the rod and tube it rides in to keep 
water and dirt out of the support tube.  Next is the shift rod to tranny 
coupler.

Here is what you need.

1 front ring rod support
2 bellows
3 rear shift rod bushings....and here is where the trouble starts...
1 rear shift coupler

I only had two rear shift rod bushings when I did mine cause that is all 
that the line drawings and books and order forms show.

The problem also is that the new rear bushings do *not* fit the rod well.
I had some from two different vendors and they both were manufactured in 
the same place cause they had the same problems.....the bushings are split 
so that when you have the rod out, you open the bushing up slightly and 
squeeze it on....there was plastic flashing inside the new bushings that 
will prevent them from fitting well.  With patience you can cure that 
part, but! there is more!  

The rod also has a small hole where the bushing has a small protrusion to 
fit in the hole and "lock" it in place on the rod.  On the new bushings
the protrusion is too large to fit in the hole!!!  I could not figure out 
how to make the protrusion smaller, so ended up drilling out the holes in 
the rear shift rod a little....It then *almost* fit the rod well.  The 
protrusion did "lock" into the hole in the rod, but it did not wrap around 
the rod completely like the original...seems to work ok that way right 
now....but I was not impressed.

Follow the bentley and when you pull the rear rod out, go slowly until you 
see the bushings slip past the end of the tube...then guide it out past 
the frame/support members without hurting it.  I really don't think mine 
needed replacing, just greasing well.

And that is the next fine situation that I have not yet found the cure 
for....when you put the rear rod back in how in the world do you get 
grease to stay on the new bushings....yeah, grease them up really good as 
they go in, but you are going to slide the front bushing thru the tube at 
least 6 feet....how do you keep it and the others lubed as you slide them 
all the way down the tunnel toward the front of the car?????  By the time 
they get 6 feet or so down the tunnel, you have scrapped all the grease 
off in the last 6 feet...

Not a bad job, but a frustrating one....and the only time you can do it 
well is with the enginge and tranny out.

Cheers, dave
