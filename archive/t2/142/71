Ok, www.bustedbus.com has some great diagrams of the heating system, and I
see what I am missing. (Not a hole lot, but enough) and your right. I am
going to overheat unless I do something quick. I'm currently not driving it
while I go over the drivetrain with a fine tooth comb.  Also, the left
heater knob on the dash is "stuck" in the half-way position. So I have a lot
of tracing back to do, as well as getting her in ship shape for the summer
camping season.
