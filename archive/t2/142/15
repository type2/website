I need to post a retraction concerning the hole in the head on the AVP 
engine.  The hole is indeed there, but it had been plugged with some kind 
of epoxy so it is not open to the atmosphere.  I was fooled because looking 
from underneath (from inside the valve cover) I saw red on the other side 
of the hole.  Nikki painted her tin red and I thought I was seeing through 
to the tin.  This morning I looked at it from the top and couldn't see 
through the hole.  A quick poke with the screwdriver and it was obvious 
that the hole had been plugged with some red stuff.  My apologies for 
implying that AVP left the hole unplugged, although in a perfect world it 
whould have been welded shut.
