Also is there any difference in the $70 aircooled.net model and the one
you can get for like $12 from JC Whitney and the like? Anyone have some
insight/experience on this?

Jonathan,

I have only ever done this with the engine out.  I *suppose* it is
possible with the engine in, and no doubt we will here form a masochist
WWF member who simply pinched the fan belt together and held it that way
(I actually tried this once in my younger, (err...  nevermind :-), days.

With the engine out, you just put on the standard engine lock, same as
for pulling the flywheel and (important point!!!) *before* you pull the
flywheel.  You would think that would be self-evident, but I am sitting
inside the body of one idiot who had to learn it the hard way :-)

As for special things to watch for, I put one on my '67 and it rubbed on
the tin...  These things are *cheap*!  Badly machined and miscast.  I
took it back off, brought it back to the shop I bought it from and they
were "oh yea, that happens," took it back and machine a bit off the back
of the pulley. as long as it was on a lathe, I asked them to check the
runout, which was OK on mine.

I am saying these degree wheel pulleys are the best solution to a bad
problem, but remember "best"  is a comparative, not an absolute.  Given
the choice of radiation poisoning, cancer, and stroke....  a stroke is
the
*best* way of dying, but that still isn't *good*!
