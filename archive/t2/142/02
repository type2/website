After running "from the seat of my pants" for way to long, I am looking =
to install a set of gauges on my 71 Westy.  Not wanting to change my =
almost pristine dash, I found a solution that seems really interesting.  =
www.seaswitch.com  Since they are located here in Oregon, I was able to =
check out their newest install on an ocean boat.  Nice package!  Only =
one small box monitors map sensor, idle speed, throttle position, oil =
pressure, temp, rpm, fuel level, and mpg. ( Or the equivalent on water =
measure)  This one box also switches on/off gps, fish finder, vhf, =
bilge, and other equipment specified by owner (up to 8 items)  Runs =
directly off of engine sensors, not hooked to computer brain box on =
boat.  As an ocean application is totally impervious to weather, and =
settles the non in dash install I was looking for. Looking for comments =
from list on this idea, and exactly where/what sensors should be =
installed on my 1600 71.  The options allow up to 8 sensor readings and =
8 equipment controls.  If you had your choice, what would these be?
