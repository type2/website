The injectors have crimped clamps which can be carefully removed
by cutting the crimped section at an angle ( metal blade or grinder )
and twisting the last bit with needle nose pliers. There is a "barb"
in the plastic injector under the hose which must not be damaged.
If the injector displays correct pattern, keep it.
2 fuel injection hose clamps work fine.
