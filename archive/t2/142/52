Just to throw in my $.02.

I towed my bus from my grandfather's in NM to my house in Houston.  The bus 
was not running.  We manually pushed the rear wheels onto the tow dolly and 
strapped the steering wheel.  Of course, left the bus in neutral.

We towed it over 700 miles behind a Ford Expedition with no problems.  Got 
it home, drained the gas tank, changed the fuel filter, spark plugs, plug 
wires, battery.  Started on 2nd crank.  Shifted into gear and away we went.

The engine is now out on 1st rebuild.  Pulled due to clutch slippage and a 
funny ping ping ping noise that I didn't like.  Original engine with 240K 
miles.  Wonder how many my clutch had on it?  Believe pinging noise was 
lifters on worn cam lobes.
