An article in a hotrod magazine many years ago said that the 009 was 
desireable because all of the advance was in at some ridiculously low rpm, 
like 1800 vs. much higher in the "stock" dizzys.  This was supposed to 
provide better throttle response and more power, which was one of the 
reasons I bought mine (along with perceived problems with my stock dizzy, 
the bargain price of $40 and the allure of having a shiny new part in my 
engine compartment).
