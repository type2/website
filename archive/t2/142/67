I just wanted to say a very big thank you to all the people who posted a 
response to my little story or sent me a reply directly. The feedback 
was educational and certainly reaffirmed why I bought one of these damn 
loafs of bread in the first place ;)

As it stands now, it just doesn't make any sense financially to have the 
bus towed the 500 miles back to the shop in NJ. Therefore, the NJ shop 
is willing to pay for, and send,  the Cleveland shop all the necessary 
parts as well as pay for half of the labor.  That's as much as I could 
hope for, given the situation, and I'm going to gladly take them up on 
their offer. I'll post a progress report sometime soon.

Thanks again,

Steve
