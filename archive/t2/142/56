Subject: Tranny bushings, linkages, adjustments?

Sorry for the deluge of posts today!

My engine and tranny are out.  I've been concentrating on engine rebuild, 
but want to do some work to tranny since it's out.

When the bus was running, shifting was a little like "OK, 1st should be 
about here", then wallowing around to about where 2nd should be.  Normal to 
go into 2nd the first couple of attempts to get into reverse.  Definitely no 
crisp shifting here (jealous of the shifting in my roommates Miata!).  Of 
course, I never expect the shifting in a 24 year old bus to be anywhere near 
Miata-ish, but would like it to be a little better.

I know to replace pilot bearing and throw-out bearing.  I see snippets of 
you guys talking about bushing, linkages, adjustments, etc.  Unfortunately 
it goes right over my head and I don't know what you're talking about.

There are a couple of rubber bushings (or was it only 1?) where the front of 
the tranny meets the shifter linkage.  Does that need to be replaced?  Is 
there another bushing where the linkage connects the gear shifter to the rod 
going to the transmission?

Sorry about these technical terms here!

Appreciate any help.

By the way, I've posted several questions to the list in this rebuild 
process and have gotten TONS of incredible p-mail that really helps me out.  
THANKS SO MUCH
