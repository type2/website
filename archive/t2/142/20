This would indicate stuck ( burnt ) points in the voltage regulator.
Light remains on with ignition off. Replace regulator.

Should only be one wire, B+51 is battery output and is 12 volt hot always.

Define gauge. Multimeter? Hooked up where ?

Would seem to indicate the meter is reversed.
You are only reading battery output voltage.
Test the meter directly at the battery.
Also, you will need to polarize the generator.
This is probably the reason the regulator failed.
And replace the defective regulator.
