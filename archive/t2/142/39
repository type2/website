When either the generator or regulator have been disconnected,
the generator must be polarized. This ensures that residual magnetism
in the pole shoes have the correct polarity. Reversed polarity burns out
the regulator relay contacts. Polarizing a burnt regulator does not repair it.
It is possible to scrape off the residue, but the plating is destroyed.
Alternator systems are not polarized. Some bears are.
