One thing to always remember about a tow dolly is that two of your wheels=
 are on the ground.  In some states, two wheels on the ground means you m=
ust have the vehicle registered and insured.  I recently sold a VW beetle=
 to a list member who lives in Massachusetts.  When reserving the dolly, =
we were informed that Mass. state law requires any vehicle with two wheel=
s hitting the ground must be registered.  Now that aint bad if you are bu=
ying a running vehicle.  But then, if it were running, would you not driv=
e it to it's destination?  Most of the kinds of vehicles we are speaking =
of (vintage vehicles)  are usually towed because they are bought in proje=
ct form.  It is always best to check with the laws in the states you are =
towing in before reserving a dolly.
