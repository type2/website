There is a scirocco/late-bus hybrid that I saw at the Dade City bug Jam a
few years back...dual engine, dual transmision, "four wheel" drive.   It
even has two shifters...It doesnt use the full rear end of the bus, just
some of it, though.

I've also seen an ElDorado (mid-ninetys model) that had
been dual engined....they added an STS drivetrain in the rear, then
combined the throttles and (auto)transmission controls....four wheel
drive, twin transaxle twin engine.  Quite a beast, and looked stock from
the outside as long as the trunk was closed!

ps: it was a mkII scirocco and they had a plexi engine lid on the bus
engine compartment...)
