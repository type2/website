Subject: Re: [T2] towing question

I own a tow dolly and have used it ALOT over the years. I have pulled big 
and small with it.

It works well but be careful.

I like the trailer (if your tow vehicle is big enough) b/c you don't have 
to worry about flat tires on the bus. If you are retrieving a field queen 
bus - old tires make it exciting in the mountains. I don't like blow outs.

The tow bar gives you four old tires to worry about but the bus doesn't 
seem to be so tall and leaning so much in the curves (IMHO) but you now 
have four old tires to worry about and four sets of wheel bearings, etc. to 
worry about.

Lesser of three evils!

The best way is to pay a flatbed truck to get it for you and to deliver it 
but the cost can be prohibitive!

See ya!
