I just had this exact same problem with my '74 westy, but the
alternator and brake lights would come on and go off erratically.
Turns out the power and ground wires to the electric fan had broken
off and were bumping into the engine tin. Fixed the wires and
all was well. Look for shorts and bad grounds.
