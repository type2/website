Indeed, proper mixture is every bit as important as proper timing. Once you=

know everything else is spec, then you can use a simple tech to set the=20
mixture close enough to not hurt things. I do believe the earlier T-I=20
Bentley described it. Turn the mix screw in till it starts to drop, then=20
turn out to highest idle, then back in till it starts to drop, then out 1/8=
=20
to 1/4 turn. If idle rpm doesn't seem to change much, either everything=20
else wasn't right before you started or the carb is foul.

009's work just fine in T-I's. Concur Ric's has WAY TOO MUCH advance=20
happening. He should trade it to the first T-IV guy he see's with an 009.=20
Both their motors will be much happier. Overheating new motors is way bad=20
practice. Never take off down the road with a new motor if you are not=20
absolutely certain of timing and mixture. Set them at stock timing and a=20
bit rich, another 1/8 turn from the above procedure. If heat seems to be an=
=20
issue, back off the timing 2=B0.

Mostly EPA additions, but as the curve is the easiest way to accomodate any=
=20
changes made to other items, bigger valve, updated carb/FI, combustion=20
chamber mods, whatever. They custom curve every single iteration of the=20
motors. If you review the specs on the various dizzies in the T-II Bentley,=
=20
you will see a number of T-I dizzies and a bunch of 205A-Z T-IV dizzies.=20
Note how each of the T-IV's has only subtle differences. All the upper and=
=20
lower ranges are similar, if you add both the vac and mech specs. They all=
=20
range very much the same. Same goes for comparing the T-I dizzies. They are=
=20
very similar in total range. So if you take a late T-I FI dizzy in put it=20
in another T-I FI, it should work just swell. If you look up the curve for=
=20
your dizzy, you can note all the others that best fit, and any of those=20
will work just swell.

Start snapping up ANY Bosch early dizzy you see. NLA last time I checked.=20
Even at prices of $500, they haven't got any to sell.

Want something special?? Find any 60's 4 cyl Mercedes, Volvo, BMW, OPAL,=20
Porsche, you get the picture, cast iron Bosch dizzy. Expect the shaft to be=

tight unless it has over 500,000 miles on it. If it does have slop, I got=20
bushings and rebuild kits for you. If you take them apart, you will see the=

centrifical weights are highly adjustable. Little lock screws holding=20
adjustable pivot points. Little stop screws to control initial and total=20
swing. Various spring sets are available. With some trial and error you can=

tune them to the curve of your stock dizzy or your custom motor. You can=20
even massage the #3 cam lobe to retard 3=B0 if it would make you giggle. And=
=20
it will perform better and outlast a dozen 009's easy. Then it's not junk,=
=20
it's rebuildable again.
