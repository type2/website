Because John Muir wrote in a book that mechanical advance distributors are
best, and the common market took it as law.

Plus, of course, the vacuum can on a mechanical advance unit cant break,
so it's a much more simple "fix"

Did I mention that most [hush tim, I said most! :)] mechanics are clueless
about advance curves and how they relate to the combustion process?
Perhaps there is a reason that VW NEVER EVER EVER put a [currently common]
009 on a typ1, typ3, or typ4 engine?


Anyway. People do what they want.  It's inarguably bad to drive while
under the influence of numerous behavior-altering drugs, but people do it.
And people put 009s on engines.  And some people never have any problem
wth it.
