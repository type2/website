Hi Jeremy,

Did you make sure your engine is turned so the #2 exhaust and intake valves 
are all the way closed?  I had a similar problem when I first started 
adjusting my valves, and realized I had forgotten to turn the engine to the 
right spot.  Check your distributor to make sure the rotor is pointing to 
the #2 firing point, and both those valves should be closed.

BTW, the "center valve" you speak of is the #2 intake valve.  If it's 
adjusted so it's partway open, you will get a loss of power.  You may also 
end up burning the valve.

Good luck!
