Subject: Re: [T2] .009, There MUST be some advantages

I want to add something that I find interesting.

we sell a modified distributor we term the SVDA, it has a 009 centrifugal
curve, with the addition of vacuum advance. The vac pots are used, and
occasionally develop a hole or leak, rendering the vacuum advance
inoperable. The timing specs for the 009 and our SVDA are identical.

It's humorous the mail I get when one of the vacuum cans destructs like
this, comments like "it runs like shite without that vacuum can", or
something similar. I send them a new can, and point out that with an
inoperable vacuum advance, they have a 009 advance curve.

So, unless you have compared an SVDA to a 009, there is no basis for
"comparison".

The 009 is inexpensive, and available new. The 009 proponents will claim
it's superiority to vac advance distributors, why didn't VW supply them on
their beetles and busses, especially since it was so much less $ ? VBG
