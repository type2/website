John,

I can't remember how old you are, but in the late 60's early 70's the 010=
=20
was the choice...009 because all the 010 were snapped up and gone.

The reason for them was the proliferation of aftermarket carb kits(holley=
=20
and others) that had *no* provision for correct vacuum readings for a vac=
=20
advance dist.

I ran holley bugspray's out the wazoo and you had to use a mech advance=20
dist because of the vacuum problem.  And yes, I still run Holley=20
occasionally and I *can* make them work right<grin>.....even with a 009.

We have all learned a lot since those times and sometimes forget that what=
=20
we know now is the culmination of 30+ years of knowledge on vw's.

That the 009 is *not* the answer for most people, but why we went there to=
=20
start with. =20

Hope you all enjoyed that trip down memory lane!<grin>

Cheers, dave
