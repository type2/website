Subject: Re: [T2] .009, There MUST be some advantages

009s are available new, and parts are readily available too.

However, check the advance curve of those 10 009s and you'll get 8 different
curves! Quality control sucks on them, they are not the same old German 009s
available 20 years ago.

009s also do not have the #3 retard that is nice on early engines
(pre-doghouse). Most of the reasons for the prevalence of the 009 is monkey
see-monkey do.

When you consider the facts, there is no reason to use the 009 since there
are other better options out there, but the 009 is available new (so it
"must" be good) and it's cheap.

> Someone (Steve Dolan??) stated earlier that they checked 10 early bays at
EB and ALL had .009 dizzys. I have owned 3 different buses with T1 engines,
and ALL of these had .009.  Yet the general consensus is that these are BAD.
SO the big question then is "If the .009 is obviously bad, then why the hell
does nearly everyone with a T1 engine in an early bay have this
set-up?!?!?!"  It must be more than cost and availability.  In the service
records of my 71 Westy (I have all records since new, thank JAH God or
whomever for Previous Owners who actually took great care of the bus!!) I
have a receipt where the PO had a reputable shop in Virginia (I think it was
VA) remove the old dizzy and install the .009 set-up. SO WHY HAVE SO MANY
DONE THIS IF IT IS UN-ARGUABLY BAD????
