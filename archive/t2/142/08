Subject: Re: [T2] towing question

This thread can become like religion with people weighing in on both sides.
Myself, I've pulled three buses by dolly this year, fresno to Van Is, Oregon
to Van Is, and from Hope to Van Is. One thing I've found is a dolly pushes
you and your brakes less than a trailer. Easy to see why,a dolly weighs a
fraction of the weight of a trailer and a good part of the weight of the
towed bus is on the ground. One thing I have to worry about that most people
dont is ferry cost, a dolly is shorter and a whole bunch cheaper to cross
with. That said, check your load and check your trans fluid and be carefull
of your downhills and you should be fine.BTW anybody remember the original
UHaul tow bars that clamped to the bumper, now those were scary!!
