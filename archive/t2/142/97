Subject: Leaking fluid...


Well I made it back from EveryBus but
at my last stop an hour from home I noticed I was leaking fome fluid. 
So first thing I checked the oil.
Oil was down no more than normal.
I sniffed the fluid and it smelled like tansaxle fluid.
It was leakin at a dripping pace from what looked like the area where the engiene and tranny mount together. It was dim and raining so I did not investigate at great length.

Anyway apply your wisdom and tell me what you think.
