Subject: Re: [T2] 78 Rabbit front end and a 72 Bus back end

My question is
Which engine was left to do the driving?
What if you were smart enough to hook both engines up to work together and have
four wheel drive?
Woops....
If you were smart enough, you might not even have started the project.
(But the two engine, 4WD is something that you might catch me messing with)

Oh well
