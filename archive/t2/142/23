Subject: Re: [T2] bus runs good, then bad

Rob's bus was the fourth I checked.  He had a couple problems, but he
major one was a sudden loss of power, bus barely ran.

First, checked the dwell, which was way out.  I pulled th epoints because
I suspected that he rider on the points had broken, but it was fine.  Put
them back in and set the dwell.  Ended up at 51 degrees, whihc is pretty
fine :-)  Of course, I had them set onece, buttoned it up, rechecked and
they were near 90!!! So I tore it back apart, and reset and reset w/o any
apparent change...  then the lady who was holding the flashlight asked me
if the sensor wire for the dwell meter should not be hooked up :-((((
Some days....

OK, so...  with dwell set, we checked timing, which was fine and advancing
correctly both on advance and retard (despite the webber progressive, Rob
has plumbed in the stock vac advance/retard dist with correct vacuum
hookups for both)

Then we moved on to vacuum, which was a major problem.  First, the fuel
delivery on his bus is a webber progressive, about which I know absolute
*beans*!  and care for them even less.  Sorry, my predjudice showing.
The vacuum was slightly less than OK (13-15") at normal idle (800-1000),
but after running a minute or two, the idle dropped off to near nothing
and the engine started to idle like... err...  badly.  The needle on the
vac gauge also went into a very fast vibration between 5-12".  I had never
seen this behavior before, and do not know what to say about it.  It was
decidedly odd.  anyone out there ever seen this?
