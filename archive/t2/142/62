actually, they did, sort of... 019, 010  and 050 mech advance dizzys. but
not in any kind of bus THIS list is driving!
for the splitty era they were the 'factory' hop-up; you could get em from
the dealer.

note that vw DID NOT put them in anything after a 25hp or so as stock...
more from a 'driver friendly' reason than any other. i assume the old birds
in the vw shops knew how to properly time for 'em.

side note: in the late 80s, when i bought my first bus, the dealer shop
foreman said he COULD NOT work on any 'modified' engine - which meant any
non-vac, non-stock dizzy.

 or even a berg dipstick tempsender!
