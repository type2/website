Help, I cant get this darned accel cable off my bus tranny, okay here's the 
scenario. I have a 1976 vw bus, its an automatic, therefore the cable goes from 
pedal to a linkage on the auto tranny, it snapped in between there.  This 
cable slides over a pole and is held on by a round c-clip inside of it, kind 
like a rubber fits on a guy, lol any ways.  so this is where the 
problem is, I cant get it off, to put the new one on.... its stuck, I mean like 
really stuck, it wont budge, I've used items such as wd-40 and let it sit over 
night, and nothing..... is there some secret tool, or maybe an easy way to 
remove this that some1 has found????

please help.
