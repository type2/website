Subject:  RE: Question replacing injector seals....

AAhhhhh!!!  Well, to late I suppose.  I got the bastards off and
replaced them with the fuel line that Mr. Dolan had given me.  ((Hey
Steve...that line was real tight fit, you were right. Lol )) At this
point what should I do.  If I were to order new injectors, would that
piece of fuel line come on it already.  I am sort of confused because
that line was very worn out and needed to be replaced.  I would think
that if it was something that was not to be replaced, that they would
make that of something other than rubber.  Something more durable.  At
this point should I order new injectors?  Bill was kind enough to give
me a partial set of injector seals to replace at least one side.  I have
already done one side now and would like to know if new injectors should
be purchased first before going through the hassle of getting down in
there and doing the other side.  Thanks again everyone.

Troy,

I didn't see an answer for you on this one yet, so will reply....NO..the

short ones on the injector are there to stay...do *not* remove.
