Subject: Trade a new exhaust valve guide for a new intake valve guide.

Hello List,

I have a box of seals and gaskets for a 1.7L
Porsche/Type IV that came from Engine Builders Supply
Co. These parts were bought in 1996 and I am just now
finding out that they made a mistake in packaging.
instead of having one set of 4 exhaust valves guides
and one set of 4 intake valve guides, they sent me 3
intake valve guides and 5 exhaust guides. I would
return them for the correct parts but these were
purchased in 1996. My question is, does any one want
to trade in their new intake valve guide for a new
exhaust valve guide for a 1.7L Porsche/type IV???? If
so, I would really appreciate it. Thanks!

David Kelly
