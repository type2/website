>leave it in neutral.   

A friend of mine had a bad experience doing this.
 He left it in neutral and checked it several
times to ensure it was so.  Then he towed the
car, a manual nissan.  Many many miles down the
road, people start waving at him to pull over. 
Car was smoking from underneath.  The car some
how jumped into gear while it was being towed.  I
guess the speed was just right and the bump or
attitude was just right.  The Uhaul guy said this
was a recognized problem and the reason for the
label on the dolly.  

Of course manual Nissans shift much easier than a
bus.  I usually have great difficulty finding two
of the gears.    

BTW I'm assuming you have a manual.  Never never
never tow an automatic in neutral.  There is no
cooling for the auto tranny and you'll burn it up
in a hurry.
