This is a bit overkill for a bone stock 1600DP, but here's the distributor
i'm running:
Mallory Unilite distributor static timed to 7 degrees, with full advancement
taking it to 32 degrees.  Vacuum port adjusted to give an additional 10
degree's of vacuum advance for a grand total of 42 degree's.  Of course,
like John said, at half to full throttle, the vaccum advance isn't there so
much.

I just finished a drive from Las Vegas, NV to SLC, UT.  I drove against a
headwind both ways (I seriously did, the wind changed direction before I
headed home), and held the throttle about a half inch from the floor board
the whole way home, for the nonstop 7 1/4 hour drive.  No pinging, knocking,
or run hot conditions.  I even left the defroster cracked open so I could
smell for anything getting hot, but never did.  (and sweated my a$$ off
doing it!!)
:-)

But, I did look up on the previous link, to see what the 71 Type2's came
with, since they were the factory bus's with 1600dp's, and with the retard
vacuum line unplugged, it came to 7 degree's BTDC static, total centrifugel
advance of 25 degree's (-at-) 3800rpm, with the advance giving 12-16 degree's at
2200 rpm.  Vacuum advance provided just 5 degree's of advance to give total
advance of 37 degree's.  I have the day off tomorrow, and since I took care
of all the chores today, i'm going to tinker with it, and see what results
this gives me.  My total advance right now comes in much sooner than it
shows, so it should be interesting what happens.  I'll let you know if it's
anything noticable.
