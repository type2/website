Subject: RE: Question replacing injector seals....


Troy,

I never took them off before as I considered them "permanent"...
So, I don't know what they look like under there...whether you could use a 
hose clamp and short new line or not.

I bought rebuilt injectors for my 78 for $38 each...they want the cores, 
but won't care if the short pieces are on ther or not as they get replaced 
during rebuild.

I have been very pleased with my rebuilts...I can do 80mph with no 
problem.....

Maybe someone else has actually taken the short ones off and replaced them 
before....an will chime in...

Cheers, dave
