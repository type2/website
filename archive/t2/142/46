Sounds familiar.

Muir really didn't know squat about type 4 engines.  Use Bentley as your 
bible instead.

That's with the vacuum retard hooked up.  Can't set that statically.  If 
you don't have vacuum retard, then you need to set it closer to 7.5 BTDC.

Timing will not cause an otherwise properly-running motor to run rough 
unless it is way, way out, like +/- 25 degrees from TDC.  Pulling plug 
wires at the distributor will more than likely reveal the real culprit of 
rough idle, which is one or two cylinders not firing.  Think about it - 
timing affects all four cylinders equally, so why should it make the 
difference between a single cylinder firing or not?  Dr. Spock told me 
that.  :)

Perhaps is right.  Timing to the fastest idle will put you just shy of 
misfiring, or about 20 degrees BTDC.  Methinks that article should be 
removed from the library (jeez, I hope I didn't write it - I might have 
said something like that ten years ago when I didn't know better).

You are right to be concerned.

If you fill the tank with 93 octane and listen carefully for detonation, 
you will probably be okay, but it couldn't hurt to back the timing off a 
little more.  If you back it off far enough that you notice a loss in 
power, you've gone too far.

>BTW, there were *NO* timing marks on the front of the pulley,

Some don't seem to have the mark - I have a couple in my attic that don't 
have marks.  The ones that do have them, well, they can be difficult to 
see.  The mark is on the part of the pulley that's in FRONT (towards the 
front of the bus) of the fan belt.  Best to find it with the engine off and 
put some whiteout in the notch to make it more visible.
