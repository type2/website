I would recheck it ASAP.  Perhaps the valve was not completely 
closed.  FWIW you don't have to be at TDC to set the valves.  There is =one 
simple rule= that I always follow:

Set the lash for the intake valve when the exhaust valve is open and 
vice-versa.

You see, any time the intake valve for a cylinder is more than slightly 
open the exhaust valve for that same cylinder will ALWAYS be completely 
closed and any time the exhaust valve for a cylinder is more than slightly 
open the intake valve for that same cylinder will ALWAYS be completely 
closed.  Yes, always.

No need to do the silly routine of pointing the rotor at #1, rotating the 
crank 180 degrees, etc..  That procedure is very error-prone!  Lose your 
place, make one wrong or inaccurate turn and the rest of the procedure is 
worthless.  I did the silly routine one time and was so unsure of the 
result that I started using the =one simple rule= from then on.  13 years 
later I'm still convinced it's the safest way to adjust valves.
