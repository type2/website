I have a 78 in MD and it is my daily driver.   I have MetLife auto
insurance (yeah Snoopy insurance) have my bus on same policy with wife's
car.  I have an assigned value policy along with collision policy and it
added about $200 a year to the policy ($8,500) I have not had to use em
but have had no problems in the 3 years I have had the insurance

this policy was less than putting my van on wifes State Farm or her car on
my Maryland Casualty policy

YMMV
