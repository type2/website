Subject: Re: [VB] Testing Starters?

You can't properly test a VW start - except for the autostick -
even at the FLAPS, because you have to support the armature.  The
only way to do this is in a bellhousing, mounted like a starter should be.
To do otherwise will ruin the starter.

In the bus, you can climb under it and short the two terminals with 
a wrench.  The starter should turn over.  Make sure the ignition is
off and the car is out of gear. (duh)
