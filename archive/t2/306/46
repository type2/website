That's what I did.  Being able to stop is very important to me.
Replacing the master cylinder is really not a part of doing the rear brakes,
so you could let that go for better weather.  It wouldn't hurt to
get ahold of a new one, so you have the correct one in your hot little
hands when it is needed.

Just tear it all down, and put it all back.  This is a really good
get-to-know-your-bus kinda' job.

Be sure to have anti-seize for the adjusting stars, brake grease
for the shoe rub points, and new cotter pins to lock the axle nuts in place.

This would also be a good opportunity to clean, inspect, and re-grease your
wheel bearings and CV joints (be sure to have new CV boots handy, in case
one/some are ripped, or get ripped while you work on the joints).  Me, I'd just
replace 'em all--it's a lot of work to *just* replace a torn CV boot, later on.
.....AND BUY GERMAN ONES.
