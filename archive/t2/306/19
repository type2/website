Subject: Re: [T2] Bay Window Calendar is here

This was the third calendar we down loaded from Rob and it was difficult 
to down load.  The others went very smooth, may be to much B/W at the 
site???? .
But it was worth the time
Thanks again Rob
Looking forward to preflighting for Havasu
P & C


Anyone else having trouble getting the .pdf's?
