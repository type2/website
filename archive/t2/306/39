From what I've read the best plugs are copper and have only one electrode.
More electrodes just block the flame but unfortunately Bosch marketing folks
are in charge.

According to this page, it's the right plug to use which is why I put it in:

Steve Dolan told me he runs W8CC in Virginia all year long.  Where has he
got to lately?

I researched plugs in the archives back in August and this is what I found:

I've also read the W7CC is considered a summer plug (warmer climates), and
W8CC a winter plug.  When I lived in B.C. the VW mechanics there put in W7DC
which is even colder than W7CC but the bus ran fine in that mild climate.

See this library article to see how the numbers fall into the range:
