Subject: Solenoid

2 quick questions regarding starter solenoids and "hot start"
1. will the "hot start" syndrome ruin an otherwise good solenoid?
2. If the starter doesn't cut on even first thing in the am or with low
temps, is it the same issue?

I ask because, I have been dealing with the no start for several months
I hooked up a set of "jumper" wires in the engine bay to keep from under the
bus.
(I will soon be ordering the relay.)
I want to know if I have damaged my solenoid.
Later,
