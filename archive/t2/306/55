Subject: Wiper Fluid Issues

I followed the instructions in the owners manual on how to fill the wiper
fluid container and prime the system.  As soon as I started to prime it
wiper fluid started to leak out from under the steering wheel.  Now I
constantly get dribbled on and every time I get out of my Bus it looks like
a dog took a leak on one of my legs.  I'm kind of new to this whole Bus
thing (but I love every minute of it), so could anyone give me some pointers
on where to start fixing this?

TIA,
