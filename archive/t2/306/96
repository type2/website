Subject: 2003 Jan pages up

Ok i finally got the pages up and running a couple small bugs in the 2 slide
shows nothing major, i think on the 66 one if you X out the show it kills
the complete window. I still need to add a couple of links to the links
page, i hope to do that tonite or tomorrow. I  have been uploading for 3
days due to isp or webserver brain farts, i hope to hell they are worth it
,,,later. let me know any opnions please ,, thanks
