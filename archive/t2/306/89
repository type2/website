Hello,

Here are some things that I can think of. First,I
would make sure your battery terminals are clean and
the clamps are tight. Have your battery tested. If it
is good, I would slow charge the battery. Use it to
start the bus. Once the bus is running, check the
alternator to see if it is putting out around 13.7v. 
If you are unable to get the engine to turn over after
you have charged the battery, check the ground cable
on your transmission. Make sure there is a good
connection there. Those are the things that come to
mind first. If all fails to diagnose, shut the bus off
and remove the key. make sure all of the lights and
accessories are off (including the dash clock if you
have one). Disconnect your ground cable from the
battery terminal. Connect your volt meter between the
ground terminal and the ground cable. This should tell
you if somthing is drawing current from the battery
that is not suppose to be. Please List, it has been
awhile since I have had to do this so please add to,
criticize, or correct any thing that I am suggesting. 

Good luck and I hope that you find out what is killing
your battery. Have a great day!
