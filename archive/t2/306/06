There are some posts of mine in the archives on this. From what I can tell GL-5 is bad for yellow metals (brass synchros) in manual transmissions but GL-5/MT-1 is ok.  I confirmed this in email exchanges with techs from Amsoil and Swepco. I put in some Swepco last July to put it to the test. Plain old MT-1 without the GL-5 designation isn't suitable for cars.
