Subject: lost 3/4/R gears

List,

A few days ago I lost reverse. Yesterday I went to do the shifter adjustment, and couldn't get reverse to work for the life of me.

After inspecting all the linkage, I found a nut missing on the front of the tranny mounting. Not one of the two that actually keep the tranny from falling, but one of the two that screw on with an axis parallel to the front/rear of the bus. It is the #1 item in the bentley diagram of the late transmission "M10 nut"

I got a new nut and put it on.

Tried the adjustment again, and now I've lost 3/4/R gears.

This sucks.

Can you help?

Billy
