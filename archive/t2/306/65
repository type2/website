Hey there Tom,

I seem to remember reading something on the vintage bus list about a 3 to 1
mixture of moly grease to STP (fuel additive or tranny additive) being the
equivalent for the splitwindows steering boxes.

Yep, I did a quick search of the VB list at:
http://www.type2.com/archive/search-vintagebus.html for STP and steering and
got a few hits. Check it out, 'cause I'm not total sure about this.

Hopefully someone will correct me on this if this mixture doesn't apply to the
baywindow steering boxes.
