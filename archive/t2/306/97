I'm searching for a VW pick and pull junkyard somewhere in my area...but I haven't found any, so I'm expanding the radius of my search.

Anyone out there in type2land...I'm looking for a friendly yard in Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Michigan, or Missouri.

Or if there is a REALLY great one somewhere, where ever, that's worth a nice long road trip, let's hear about it.

Thanks.

Charles
