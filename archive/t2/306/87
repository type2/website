I installed fog lights in my 77 Riveria last week, and today I pulled them
out because they were drawing too much power.  When I tried to start the van
afterwards, the starter will turn, but I'm not getting the engine to turn
over, also I have headlights, and the gauges have backlights, but I do not
have any other lights in the instrument cluster, I.E: egr, high beam,
turnsignals.  All the fuses are fine under the dash, so I'm thinking I
must've lost a ground, or something else I don't know about.  Any ideas
where I should start looking before I wreck something.
