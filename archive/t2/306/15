Remove the brake shoes and back out the "bolt" from the adjuster.

Find a long bolt with the same threads as the adjuster.

Use a lot of penetrating oil on the adjuster, inside and out, for as long
as your patience holds out.  An hour works OK, A day works better, a month
can be magical!

Run the long bolt into the stuck adjuster until it bottoms.  Continue
applying torque and it should push out the adjuster.

When reassembling, use anti-sieze on the threads of the adjuster and in
its socket.  That is what the stuff is for!
