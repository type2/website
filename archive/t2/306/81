i have had classic insurance on my dormobile for years. recently i added my thing to the policy
and discovered a few new twists.
1. you must have another car to drive
2. the vehicle 'must' be worth 5 grand
3. it must be primarily used to attend shows and events. (not hard every campout is an event!)
 but no longer a max limit on mileage
4 your cost is dependent on stated value. ie you tell them how much you want to insure it for.
5 pictures of all 5 corners.

but it is so cheap by comparrison to regular insurance!  i pay 113$/year for both cars with 100
being the minumum policy amount.  i need to up the value of the dormo as i only have it insured
for $7k and i don't think that would replace it ;-)  but i could more than replace my thing for
the minimum $5k!  i use K & K insurance 1-800-637-4757

if your bus doesnt' meet the criteria try inquiring your regular insurance for 'motor home'
inusrance. that used to be cheaper.  i have progressive and discovered it to be 10 bucks more and
my car ins went up due to lack of multiple car so i left the 78 as just a 'car'.  i had heard that
state farm was favorable to this condition. but i have never used them.  even if you keep it as a
'car' on a regular policy and have invested money in it and it is pre 80 you should get 'stated
value' insurance or they will attempt to tell you it books for 2-3 grand and you'll have to prove
its worth etc if you ever have a claim.  stated insurance is where you tell them the value and
they garuntee that much money back.
