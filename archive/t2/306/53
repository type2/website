Subject: Update on shipping of Free stuff

Hello List,

I hate to have to tell everyone this that it concerns
but I have only shiped out half of the "Christmas
Presents". Things around my house are starting to
resemble some sort of normalsy so I should have them
in the mail soon. For those that I told, I did get
that job and my mom is out of the hospital recovering
pretty well so far. I get a free day off this week
(Sunday), so I can finish cleaning some things and get
them packed up. I just wanted to let everyone know who
I have promised things to or owe thing things to that
I haven't forgoten and I WILL have them in the mail
VERY soon now that things are calming down and I have
more usable free time.

Have a great day!
