Subject: Rear Breaks 75 Bus

I have a rear break cylinder that is leaking on my 75 bus and will be
replacing in next weekend.  I am wondering what other things I should do
since I will be working on the breaks. 

Things like: Replace the cylinder on the other side, new shoes, hardware
kit, turn the drums, replace hoses, replace master cylinder? 

I also am willing to hear any advice anyone has to make this job go as
smoothly as possible. 

Don
