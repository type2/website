Lucky folks with '71 and up buses don't need the cotter pins as they have
composite drums.  There is a handy divot in the hub that allows a socket
wrench to have a straight shot at the cylinder bolt.

Having done "precautionary" CV boot replacements with German Lobro brand

if the boots aren't cracked or leaking it is better to leave them alone.
I carry replacements and the tools to change them with on trips, just in
