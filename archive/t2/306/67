Subject: Newbie with a 75 Westy

Hello:

I'm a vintage Land Cruiser enthusiast normally but I just bought a 75 VW 
Transporter Westfalia Camper. I couldn't resist the darn thing. Now I 
would like to appeal to all your list great members to tell me what the 
heck I have? It's got 85,400 miles on it.

The older gentleman who sold it to me had an outfit in CA rebuild the 
engine using a 4 cylinder Porsche 914 engine. (less the heads) It's no 
longer fuel injected and has 2 Weber carbs and Jacobs ingnition. This 
was all done about 7000 miles ago.

It runs great and is in very good shape. It has the pop up camper, child 
hammock and he had an additional add-on heavy duty tent frame to give to 
me. (No canvas). It's orange in and out, no rust, and has an ice box, 
sink and several storage compartments. No stove. It's also got a black 
bra and spare with tire cover on the front. Orange plaid seats and 
cushions. The kids LOVE IT!

So I would like to know where to look on the web for a little history on 
these vehicles and let me hear any comments you may have on the engine 
modification.
