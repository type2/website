don, i think it has to do with levels of contentment, and if it ain't broke
don't fix it chants. consider how many miles since YOU've been in there
(not the PO). long story short, if you live in a dankity place like oregon,
or your wife is having a baby any minute, or both, and you just need to do
a quick cylinder change out, i'd stick to that just to get going and start
stopping. YMMV - and that is going to be apparent when you open up and
check out the world inside one brake drum. you may find its a real mess
inside the drum and have to deal. lessunder, i'm hesitant to suggest
turning drums. i fall on the side of the camp that says not to remove
metal. if you want to be industrious, certainly enjoy changing out the
rubber hoses. that is a routine service needed at least as often as brake
cylinders.
