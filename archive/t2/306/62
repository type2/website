This happened to me also.  I think the label on the kick panels in my bus
says 42 psi max but I bet it started to squirt well before you got there.

First check to see if the leak is coming form a split in a hose or from the
valve in the column. I think it's prudent to replace all of the hose anyway
because they are so old.

If you are increasing the pressure to get the water higher up the windshield
then perhaps the needle valve in the nozzles have corroded and no longer
produce a nice spray pattern but rather a dribble.  New VW Brazil nozzles
are available for about $5-6 each.  I did see German VW nozzles at
www.bughaus.com for $13 each but they couldn't possibly be that different.
