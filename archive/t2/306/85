Subject: 78 westy for sale $4000

Hi All,
        We recently purchased a Eurovan Camper and need to sell
    our  much cherished 78 westfalia camper $4,000.  This camper
    is in all around good shape and ready to go camping with 220k
    miles.  Don't let the miles scare you  this bus has been well 
    maintained. It had extensive body work and was repainted
    ivory in 98
    New front axle beam and ball joints in 96
    86 Audi 5 cylinder engine, has about 75 k total miles
    ( 15k of them on the westy) It works great / rocks. 
    86 audi heater/ defroster (the cabin is nice and warm) 
    Complete indash instrumentation
    cd player/ radio indash       
    Add on cruise control
     4 speed manual Transaxle replaced in 99, with a low mileage unit. 
    suspension, tires and  steering are very good 
     draw-tite hitch    
    This bus has always been garaged and has rarely been used on 
    bad winter roads. The westy  camping features are all standard 
    features,  with the original sage green interior includes onboard 
    water system with sink, ice box, pop top, upper bunk (sleeps 2), 
    also rear seat folds down and sleeps 2, various cabinets. front 
    seats are 91 mustang gt seats that recline, with lumbar support
    and the originals are also available if desired. Front passenger
    seat swivels so it can face toward the rear at the campground. Has 
    camping curtains all around. 115volt air-conditioner  that fits
    the driver side window at the camp ground.
