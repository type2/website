Craig,

Borescopes are more commonly used in the medical and *aircraft* 
industry...go make friends with a certified aircraft A&P mechanic!

Medical borescopes generally cost between $1200 and $15,000!

Aircraft industry(jet engines mostly) use them for inspecting
the turbine blades.

You might have better luck using a computer camera that just has the ccd 
on the end of a long set of wires.


Cheers, dave
