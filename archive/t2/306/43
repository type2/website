if the brake cyl is leaking then you can count on changing the shoes, and
if you change one side yer supposed to change the other.  
   just did the same job last week, get PLENTY of brakekleener, probably a
spray can per side...just to get all the old brake fluid off of
everything, brake fluid can ruin a pad or shoe almost instantly...

good luck
