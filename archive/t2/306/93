Subject: oil sheen

I just recently did a top end rebuild on my 71 westy.. now when ever i run 
the bus i get a light spray of oil inside the engine compartment, so 
everything is shiny, and it eventually collects in the pully tin and drips 
out... i lose about a half quart for two hours of driving.. i am out of 
guesses of where the oil is coming from.. any ideas out there? thanks .. 
scott 71 westy ..  1641 .. dual carbs .. 009 ...
