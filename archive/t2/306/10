Subject: Dimming Head Lights

73 Westy. The starter had seized up so my son and I put in a new starter this
weekend. Well, I supervised, he did the pulling, twisting and cussing. The
battery is less than six months old. After we installed the new starter, I
noticed when the heater blower is on, the generator light comes on. This is
new. But hey, I live in Tucson... how often do I need the heater? I've been
driving the bus around during the day for the past couple of days (no heater
on), it runs beautifully, starts right up. Then tonight while driving with the
head lights on (no blower), the lights got dimmer and dimmer. The generator
light did NOT come on at any point. Battery was completely discharged. I was
able to get a jump and drove it about a mile to my daughters place before the
lights quit again. Mys suspicion is that there is something amiss with the
blower motor and not the alternator. I had a similar problem a couple of years
ago when my new motor was installed. When I took it back to the mechanic he
said that there was something about the wire of the blower. Any ideas, oh
Gurus of Busosity? I GOTTA get this bus to BBB in Lake Havasu. Thanks! Nancy.
