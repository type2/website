[...]
If the bus has nor been run in a long time, run it for
a while(10-15 min), take all the plugs out and do a
dry compression test, write results down,(wet test)
put a couple of squirts of oil in the cyl's(one at a
time)test compression , if the pressure comes up it is
rings if it stays the same it is valves or valve seat.
