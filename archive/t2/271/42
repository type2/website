Subject: Hecho in Mexico

Hey All,

I bought a 71 transporter a few months back. It came
with papers that showed the engine was rebuilt in 98
and does sound and run really good. I just went to
give it a tune up this last weekend and while checking
the serial #s to see if it was the original engine I
found instead "Hecho in Mexico".

Is there any thing special I need to know or look for
when working on this engine? do I follow the same
specifications and tune up procedures?

Thanks for any help...
