Subject: Bk and info

I just wanted to inform everyone the web pages should be updated by this
weekend, I had a major system crash thursdayknocked out my OS plus locked me
out of my back up HD where the web pages were stored. My nephew and i spent
the weekend trying to rescue those files as well as my other stuff stored on
it. Thus the reason i missed the Octoberbus campout, sorry folks i would
really rather have been there. Well anyway thanks to some software by a co.
called Runtime Software we were able to use a program called Getdataback and
retrived every file on the HD. If not for that program there would be no
update this month.  To put it simply  they saved my a**. Ok ya'll have. a
good week.
ps i'm wading through my e-mail box asap,,later
