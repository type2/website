Subject: Alternator replacement write-up with pics 

Not too long ago someone posted a very informative write up with pictures on
a web site for the replacement of the alternator on a type 4.

My alternator is about to give up it's life.  She gave me a nice scare all
the way up in Bar Harbor, Maine but she made it home (Boston) although I
could never relax because I could tell something wasn't right.

(pulley shifts at idle but seems okay at speed).

If somebody knows that web page I'm talking about could you please send it
to me?  I searched in the archive but so much comes up that I couldn't track
it down.

Thanks in advance!

Mike
1977 Westy (original alternator for now).
