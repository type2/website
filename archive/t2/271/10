<< I coated the copper exhaust gaskets with a new product from NAPA, which is 
designed to seal exhaust systems and is claimed to withstand 2000 degrees 
of temperature. Six bucks a tube. It is a grey pasty material that in a 
plastic tube that has been totally evacuated of air.  The stuff starts 
curing when it hits the atmosphere. You put it where you want it, put the 
parts together, and leave it alone for a day or two. It cures in place with 
no catalyst other than the air. Then you start the engine and warm it up 
for 15 minutes, and the engine heat completes the curing process. It is 
some kind of high temperature epoxy, according to the NAPA counter man.
