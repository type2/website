I would look at the steering coupling right away.
Lift up the floor mat. Remove the screws holding the collar to the floor at
the base of the steering column. Slide the collar up.
The coupling is between the steering column shaft and the box. It
disintergrates over time.
Also look at the bolts that hold the box to the frame. Make sure they are all
there and tight.
