Subject: update on timing hybrid

I've finally gotten my hybrid 67-68-? engine timed and
running well. (Knock on wood...)

For what it's worth, here's what I did: I turned the
distributor until the engine ran the fastest without
stalling. Then I backed it off ABOUT 5 degrees. That
puts the timing at about 10 degrees, using a timing
light.

Some things I learned: make sure the idle is
correct...800-900 in my case, it makes a big
difference in the reading. And don't get the drive
ratchet handle anywhere near the whirling belt--yowl!

btw, if anyone is interested in a timing light, i've
got a really nice Acton chrome induction one, that has
been used only once--to test it. $25. email direct for
details.

(A friend gave me an old beat up one that works fine
for my purposes.)
