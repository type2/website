The full length rack is a great thing to have, even if you don't put cargo
up there/  Get a sheet of 1/4 inch CDX plywood, prime and paint it white,
and attach it to the rack with electrical conduit clamps.  You will get a
reduction in interior temperatures of 10 degrees or more with the top of
the bus shaded.
