Geez George you're taking too long at an hour. Buy one of the angle or die
grinders off ebay for 16 dollars (chinese man. of course, but at that price
use it and throw it away. Mine is on it's 3rd year and many hundreds of
uses, but still working), and grind that baby off in about 10 minutes. I had
a dremel for years , but saw the light when I decided to port some VW heads.
With the 1/4" die grinder the job is about 1/5 the time.
Take care,
Courtney
