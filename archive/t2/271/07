You need an Archimedes (a lever) or two. Use a prybar to push through the 
adjustment slot. Now use another prybar with a beaked end. (Any FLAPS will 
have cheap Chinese, round tapered and beaked, 4 bar sets of pry bars.) Use 
the beak to wedge between the upper slot bar and the alternator 
lug/housing. When you get the right angles of the KattyWampus to provide 
the tension, use your third hand to tighten the lock nut.

Note, if the KattyWanpus puts too much strain on the bracket, it can break.
