Subject: John Brown's Buses next weekend in Harpers Ferry, WV

It's less than a week away from John Brown's Buses  in Harpers Ferry, 
WV.  To all those listees in the DC area and those that want to make a road 
trip, come join us October 18-20th and enjoy the company of fellow Bus 
folk, a beautiful location, and the changing of the leaves.  There is no 
rain in the forecast and the temps will be in the 60s during the day and 
mid 40s at night.  Hope to see you there!
