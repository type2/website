	George:

	You wroted: "...a few abrasive cutoff wheels in a Dremel..." and
"This method takes some time..."

	Understatements of the decade, nay, the century ;-)

	Since F.M.S. (tm) is located 120 miles southwest of my domicile, and
the operations were scheduled to run over a weekend, so we say in my
business:  "Timeliness is next to Supreme Being-liness..."  IOW - "Why walk,
when you can take the Space Shuttle to run over a chicken?"  The proprietor
of F.M.S. (tm) - to whom I am closely related (if you hadn't guessed by
now), is always willing to try new and wonderful things with his toys.

	Speaking of which - a new way of filling hydraulic lifters was
discovered over the weekend.  Of course, it requires that you have a vacuum
pump and a tightly sealed jar filled with a refined petroleum product of
choice.  I would have used my traditional method of disassembly, filling the
lower chamber with oil, depressing the check valve with a stout wire,
holding the valve body in place with the "ol' scribe in the port-hole
trick", and reassembly...  But the manufacturer (starts with "Web" and ends
with "Cam") includes a dire warning with the lifters to the effect that if'n
they are disassembled, you'll go blind, a contract will be taken out on your
life, hair will grow on your palms, your motor will blow at first crank,
you'll go insane, or some-such such tomfoolery...

	I was thinking of just keeping this as a p-mail back to George - but
anybody else on the list taken apart a W-C hydro lifter to load it and their
motors lived to tell the tale?  FWIW it's a W-C 91H, going into a 78 x 96
motor, a/c.net crank 'n Scat Type 1 rods, Biral Babies + JE forged pistons,
Remmelle Level 2 heads, 45 Dells...
