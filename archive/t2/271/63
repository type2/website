Subject: Bird's chirping in my engine

Chirp chirp chirp, chirp. Compression test found the
bird 1-120 2-122 3-120 4-55. Down for the count, hope
it's just a air leak that can be fixed by resealing
the head, if it was'nt for bad luck I wouldn't have
any luck at all, I build engine's for other people all
the time and never have a problem with them, build one
for myself and have to do it twice. Phil
