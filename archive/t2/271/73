Subject: RE: [VB] RE: [T2] AridZona Full Length Bus Rack

Tom Conner claims over 400+ lbs. I believe the factory VW Tranporter
warrantee :) will be void if you exceed 220lbs of roof load on the
gutters. Larger racks help distribute this over all those legs. I've
touched at 250lbs of camping gear across the whole rack.
I think the racks can hold more than the bus gutters, and they remain
the limiting reagent here.

Anyone know how much you can load on one of these racks???

500 lbs?  10 4x8 sheets of 5/8" plywood?
