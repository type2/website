Subject: trying to get engine in my 71 

Hey every one, thanks in advance for any suggestions, this list has really 
helped my on my head replacement job.

OK, I have the engine in the bus minus one inch. I've tried turning on the 
pulley as maybe the spline was hanging up but it just doesn't want to go in 
that last inch.

The bolts to the tranny are lined up and going in ok, and I can't tell what 
is hanging the engine up.

Does anyone have any suggestions for getting my engine back in my bus?

Thanks,
Daniel
