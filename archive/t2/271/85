Subject: Help in Maryland:)

Hello,
I am new to the list and am hoping someone here can help me. I just was
given a 1977 camper, all I want is for it to be is solid running and rust
free. I am not going to run it hard just fair-weather camping etc. I believe
I have good leads on mechanical help: Peek Performance of Seabrook, MD and
Reiners of Adelphi, MD.
What I need is help finding a good shop or person to do some body work. Not
a huge amount I am not talking a complete restoration, just no leaks and no
rust. So please someone must have recommendations I hope. MD/DC/VA area.
Any help is much appreciated.
Peace
Meg
