Hi all.
I finally got around to removing the 2L motor and gear box from the '71 bus I
have (it's not the original engine obviously!). I bought this as a running bus
and did ~100km in it while driving it home. I knew this motor needed a full
re-build when I got it, but it will give me plenty of experience and hopefully
end up with a good spare motor for Andy long before I need it. I was amased
though by the movement in the crank, I could move the fly wheel ~0.5mm
radially! All that on a motor that seemed to run quite well and no major oil
leaks. I just hope the motor is worth re-building, judging by it's general
condition it's been run into the ground.
