Great story.  Good to here of success.  I hope
you lead others to consider there systems.  

I've heard that "it's supposed to run hot" and
"you're supposed to run vw's hard" crap from
these self-proclaimed guru's that really don't
know about making a VW run well and run for a
long time.  You'll know them by there chrome
009s.  

My guess is that, despite the list's efforts,
most are running around with hot engines, either
from poor timing, poor carburation, or poor
cooling.  I keep reading posts suggesting that
listmembers run 250 all the time.  This always
makes me cringe.  Others, usually the folks
without guages, say they floor it up the hills
and drive 70-80+ mph consistently.  No wonder
these engines don't last.  Dropped valve city.  

Kudos to you, brother.  Happy bussin.
