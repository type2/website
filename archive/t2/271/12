I used to think the Bentley manual was the "i" in "it" until I started this
engine rebuild.  I am finding my Haynes manual has much more text to walk you
thru it... and it even leaves much to be appreciated.

Anyways, I put together one bank and all the hydraulic valves did not "give"
like the manual (s) said.  I got to the other side and 3 of the 4 gave way
easy with the thumb test as described.  I promptly took one apart and "bleed"
it as I was told.  The Bently indicated that once you had her together, you
need a half of a push rod and a press to enable to push it down enough to get
the clip in place.  I tried it by hand and it wouldnt give.   I then
remembered that type2.com had some good articals and went about see what
others did at this point.  Boston engine has a good artical and notes that
you
can use the "scribe" that you use to drop the plunger, and stick it in the
oiling hole in the side to hold the plunger until you get the clip in..
Smart, very smart.  Now why dont Bently mention this????????

Now for my question.  Bently and Haynes say preload 2 turns.  That is a lot,
and a lot more that when I took my engine apart.  Boston Engine said to set
them at 1/4 to 1/2 turn, even maybe set them a .006" like its earlier
brothers
and sisters and later preload as mentioned once you know the air is out of
them.   Since Boston engine had the swell idea for easily bleeding, I am
thinking they may be a step or two ahead of Bently.  Do I pre load or not?
How much?  Just wondering...
