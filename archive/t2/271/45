Subject: blinking alternator light/flasher problem

Hi all,
I sent this out last week, but didn't get much of a
response. My situation is degrading somewhat and
hopefully someone has some insight as to what I might
look for first. As mentioned below, this thing going
on is completly random and intermitent. This morning
though, it was happening alot and when I pulled over
to note what was going on, I noted the following when
I turned on my flashers: flasher and alternator light
on the display blinking erraticaly, no blinking lights
on the outside and something getting hot under the
dast (small wisps of smoke). I used hand signals the
rest of the way. Anyone know where I should begin?
Thanks!

Hi listmembers,
For some time now, I have noticed that sometimes my
red light glows on and off with my blinkers as they
blink. This is completly random, sometimes doing it
and sometimes not. The red light also sometimes glows
very faint and then bright for a few blinks. This
behavior does not correlate with any other actions
that I can account for (stepping on brakes,head lights
etc.). I have cleaned up the ground wires for the rear
lights where they connect to the rear of the engin
compartment, but the funny behavior continues. Is
there any obvious place I should look first. As
always, everyones help is greatly appreciated.
