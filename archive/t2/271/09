Subject: re: baywindow windshield

Dear TYPE 2

I need a windshield for a 74 westy...I got hit by a rock from one one of 
those trucks...you know "building the carolinas one truck load at a time"...

I am in charlotte, nc...

it may be repairable, but i think it is too big of a crack...

we are still living in our van...we have been from charlotte, nc to 
newfoundland, canada to back now we are heading west...
