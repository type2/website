The limit stems from two concerns, handling (a bus is a tall, narrow
vehicle, and putting load on top adds to its tippyness), and dynamic
loading (200 pounds can become 1000 if you bottom out the suspension on
an unexpected bump).

Other than antennas, I use the rack for stuff that is dirty or smelly.
Extra spare tires and gas cans go up there nicely.  I've also seen
auxilary gas tanks mounted on racks.  Pretty slick, as they are too high
to easily get into to steal fuel, but if you slide the door open you can
fill them easily while standing in the opening.
