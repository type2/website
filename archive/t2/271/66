Subject: Single port heads up

    I ordered more single port heads from my main supplier and was shocked
at a price increase for them. When I asked what's the deal I was informed
that they have stopped production on single port heads. To verify this I
also called another supplier I use and they had even a bigger price increase
and was informed that they only recieved 200 heads out of an 800 head order.
Another thing that VW is stopping to make in Brazil? and the list grows.

ronnie  keeping those who care informed.

  Is this true or just a marketing gimick? Are they going away the same as
rebuidable fuel pumps, 40 hp big bore P/L and the list goes on
