Subject: got engine in, thanks listmembers

Thanks to all that helped, got engine in tonight.  Have 3 of 4 bolts 
tightened.

I just raised it a tad on the jack and pushed and pushed and turned on the 
pulley and pushed and wiggled and pushed some more.

The bolt that goes through the starter isn't showing up on the other side. 
Ran out of time but hopefully tommorow I can get that last bolt tighened.

Can't wait until I fill her up with oil and get the valves adjusted and 
crank her up.

Thanks,
Daniel
