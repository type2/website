Fine for torqueing it up, but for breaking the thing loose, use full-sized
3/4 drive handles.  I find a slide bar works well and is very sure and
stable for "step-on" torqueing, others like breaker bars for their
flexibility.

George <--who's broken too much 1/2 inch drive stuff on VW axle and gland
nuts.  Sure, Sears'll replace it, but I still have to drive down there.
