Subject: Loose fan belt.

Any suggestions on how to tighten the fan belt on a 75 2l engine? I
replaced the belt a few weeks ago and had trouble finding anything to
get leverage on to move the alternator. The belt has stretched slightly
since install and I am going to tighten it tomorrow. Hope there is an
easier method than brute strength.
Thanks.
