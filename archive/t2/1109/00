Thanks for the tip on leaving the spark plug in during injector failure to
maintain pressure. I've had it happen (bad wiring at injector plug, and
always wondered if I should have pulled the plug instead of leaving it in.

Great stories. It's interesting to me that when I first started thinking
about going air-cooled, the reads on these engines made them seem soooo
finicky and difficult. I suppose they are to a degree, and I found the FI
daunting at first- but the more I read the more it appeared that if you keep
an eye on things (timing, CHT, and leanness/richness) they really are tough
little beasts. Maybe a thread on Limping Home or On the Road Repairs might
be be fun too.
