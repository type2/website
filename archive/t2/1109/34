AutohausAZ wants $198 for the newer one so no real cost savings there, but I guess you are getting new rather than rebuilt.  Yes, the later boosters will fit but they sit right up against the frame (no clearance).  You will also get *more* power assist with the later booster than with the stock one.  I like it that way so I run the later booster in my '73.
