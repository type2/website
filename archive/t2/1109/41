Subject: engine bearer hitting heat exchanger

I'm in the process of final steps of installing rebuilt 2.0L FI engine in '78
bus.  I am converting the exhaust system to a 72-74 system for simplicity's
sake.  When installing the right heat exchanger, the engine bearer bar is
resting on the heat exchanger...this can't be right.  The exchanger is
installed correctly as is the bearer bar (i think it only goes in one way). 
When the engine was pulled, it was mounted into the bus correctly and did not
tilt to one side or the other and there was no damage anywhere so i have no
reason to believe the mustache bar is bent.  the exhangers are new danish ones
purchased from a reputable online vendor.  Is there something i'm missing
here?  can I assume that when the engine is installed that the weight of the
engine will be enough to lift the bearer bar slightly off the heat exhanger?  
thanks, greg
