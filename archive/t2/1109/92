Subject: Re: [T2] valve adjustment

Now that is just frigging brilliant. I'm impressed, but should you rotate the
PULLEY CW or CCW to get to #3?

Always be yourself, because the people that matter don't mind,
and the ones who mind, don't matter.


Point the rotor at the #1 firing position (the mark on the distributor).
  Now adjust the 3 front-most valves (towards the front of the car) on
 the passenger side and then the 1 rearmost valve on the driver's side.
 More specifically, this would be valves 1e, 1i, 2i, 4e.

Rotate the crank until the rotor points 180 degrees from where it was
 (pointing at the #3 firing position).  Now adjust the 3 front-most
 valves on the driver's side and the 1 rearmost valve on the passenger
 side (3e, 3i, 4i, 2e).

Only two moves of the crank and you're done!
