yanked the engine.

hauled it to Boston

today with  me looking on Gary opened er up and it was clear what happened
the oil galley plug above and behind the oil filter fell out.  oil presure 
stayed high, but oil never got to the engine...blew out the side almost at 
full presure...

number 3 bearing siezed hopefully that was the only problem.  so far no 
serious other issues noted...

still $$$$$
but less $$$ than it could have been.

Gary declared it "act of god"  also said he had never seen this particular 
galley plug fall out ever.


to be continued.

Bob
