Not the van...  but the behemoth is getting a motor and trans rebuild even as
I type.  the comment was "I could almost slide a popcicle stick betweenn the
piston and cylinder wall", so I guess it was about time.  

However, on to
"multicultural" issues - I think this will be the Summer of Rust - I have so
many rust issues on both vehicles, and now that my brother is back in the
area, he's volunteered to teach me the intricities of replacing sheet metal. 
I've been eyeballing wire-feed welders (any suggestions before I plop $$$
down) - I'm kinda drawn to the Sears 110 that runs either flux core or gas... 
I'd do 220 but I want something I don't need to rewire my house for!  It's
only like, if I remember, $300-400...  I've done stick welding (art projects)
but this is totally new.

I was also told I want an air compressor and a
plasma cutter...  (!!!???)  Comments?  Do I need something like that for these
jobs, or is it overkill?  Would a die grinder work jus as well?  Or am I
looking the wrong direction?

Sus
77 westy (Limecello) the maybe it'll run
someday project bus (at least it's green!)
71 Cortez 21' Behemoth (B!tc#ita),
the "don't believe the seller" special.
