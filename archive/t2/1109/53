Subject: RE: [T2] Replacing SC bed floor?

 I've been considering it too on my '78 Westy. I have a donor bus I'm trying
to cut the floors out of. I was really disheartened when I looked underneath
to see how many welds there are to be removed. YIPES!!

So this is something I've never done as the other 3 trucks I've had have
been OK, and I'm wondering...
 
First, I'm stupid to even consider doing this (I know that in advance,) the
thing is replacing the floor would take the '69 from average (can be a nice
driver but not pristine) to truely restoration class.  My intention had NOT
been to do this actually when I got it because aside for the wood strip
rivet holes and some extra holes added for??,
