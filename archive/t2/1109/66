I don't know how to tell sodium valves, but you could just adjust 
your valves for 0.008" (engine cold) and then heat the bus up and 
then pull the covers off and check for any valve lash.  If you have 
any, then let it cool completely, adjust for 0.006" and test 
again.  Lash gone, you're good to go :)

I'm sorry, but you never want a no lash condition for solid lifter 
setup. That will burn the valves pronto.
