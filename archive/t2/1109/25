Subject: Late Bay steering box replacement

Hi Volks,

Anybody here do one of these recently?

I just took delivery of a brand new TRW steering box for my bay. There 
was a spanish note on the bag that sounds like it's telling me I need to 
put 90W oil in it.

I have tried turning the shafts by hand and it's way too tight... is 
that normal?

I want to get this installed before Everybus.... sure wish the weather 
would go back to the 18C we had last week. Any helpful hints would be 
appreciated greatly.



Happy Trails,
