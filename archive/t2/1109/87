Subject: Re: [T2] sodium filled valves

Well, I wish that I did have the sodium-filled but I'd bet a bundle that 
the local VW guy who put heads on it for the hippie California kids 
didn't sell them on the idea of paying a lot more for longer-lasting 
valves.  That's how I got it.  They didn't pay the bill, he got a 
mechanic's lean and sold it to me.  Unfortunately, he's retired and 
moved so I can't even ask him.  Thanks, all....KR
