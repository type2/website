Subject: Pertronix Ignitor Electronic Ignition installation problems

Recently bought the Ignitor (part number 1847V) for my 1978 stock bus for the
distributor (part number 0 231 168 005)and I can not get the magnetic sleeve
to slip down the shaft all the way it needs to go.  Because it doesn't the
rotor does not fit properly.  I broke my first sleeve trying to get it on
(with too much force) and Pertronix sent me another but it is doing the same
thing.  Anyone else experience this problem?  I hate to whittle away on the
sleeve because I don't want to screw it up.  If you've had this problem do you
cut the bottom of your rotor off?  Any suggestions besides going back to
points would be appreciated

Thanks,
Kevin
