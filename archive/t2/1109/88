Subject: valve adjustment

Karl von Salzen had an easy method to adjust the valves by yourself 
using a remote starter switch and watching the valves.  I'm having 
trouble finding finding the timing mark on mine.  I don't have the 
normally notched pulley like I see in the pictures.  I don't know what 
the story is on that.  I tried to search the archives but didn't find it 
and didn't find any of Karl's stuff except for a couple of things in the 
library itself.  Are the list searches not covering the old stuff 
anymore?  Does anybody remember Karl's method?  Or know how to get it 
out of the archives?   I have no help right now and I find it difficult 
to do by myself.   Thanks...KR
