Don't worry about the timing mark - as long as your in the ballpark of 
#1 and #3 firing positions, you'll be fine.

This should help:

Point the rotor at the #1 firing position (the mark on the distributor). 
  Now adjust the 3 front-most valves (towards the front of the car) on 
the passenger side and then the 1 rearmost valve on the driver's side. 
More specifically, this would be valves 1e, 1i, 2i, 4e.

Rotate the crank until the rotor points 180 degrees from where it was 
(pointing at the #3 firing position).  Now adjust the 3 front-most 
valves on the driver's side and the 1 rearmost valve on the passenger 
side (3e, 3i, 4i, 2e).

Only two moves of the crank and you're done!
