To throw my 2cents in, I drive a Prius and find that Shell gas gets me 2-4mpg
more on the highway than any other.  Now if I'm lucky to get gas with no
ethanol then it goes up even more.  I will check on Chevron and see how that
goes. 

Not to open a can of worms or another thread but for those that wish may want
to check out this site:

I used it in a Dodge Stratus with nice results and looking to try it on my bus
when it becomes a daily driver, but not in my Prius (rubber gas bladder). 
Follow the 3oz per 10 gallons, more is not better!  Mythbusters had this as
part of a show but used too much and the mpg dropped alot.  Do your own
research but for me I am comfortable with the results I saw.

"I like sticking with Chevron gas because of the Techron. You used to
have to be a professional mechanic to get Techron to service fuel
systems; now it comes in the gas. Top Tier gasolines are my second
choice where Chevron is not available."
