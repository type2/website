Be sure to follow the directions on setting up the carb to a "T". The weber 
progressive is fussy.

Set the idle needle to exactly 2 full turns.
Set the idle speed to fully close the butterfly then turn screw 1/4-1/2 turn 
open. You can stick a finger in the carb to feel when the butterfly starts 
to move.
Get a full list of instructions for the rest of the details.
