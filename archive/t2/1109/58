If a US delivery, that would have been a 2.0 FI engine. You do have 
an oval hole in the vertical sheet metal adjacent the battery for the 
ECU mount?? And do you have the welded in mount for the FI 
aircleaner/AFM on the right side engine compartment, or evidence of 
it being cut out/removed?? FI tank with the return line fitting 
sealed?? Two slot type holes in the left frame for the FI fuel pump mount??

A 72 or 73 Bus with dual carbs engine.You have a FrankenBus. Join the club.

Those conversion kits are prone to air leaks. They use the standard 
Bug upright engine intake seals, and I have seen lots of those only 
last a year or two before leaking. The genuine VW seals, if you can 
find them, will last much much longer. Also, as a matter of regular 
maintenance, check the head flange bolts for tight, as well as the 
carb mount nuts. My guess is more than a 50% chance the backfire 
issue is due to air leaks in the intake system. Lots of idle problems 
are due to same.

Who boy, just the wrong curve for the T-IV engine. Get an original or 
an SVDA with the full 25 degree mechanical advance and further vacuum 
can advance in there. Difference in drivability is huge.
