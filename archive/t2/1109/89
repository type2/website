Subject: Re: [T2] valve adjustment

While you're researching that kevin, do a check on how to adjust your valves 
without a feeler gauge. I remember that it is by number of turns on the 
screw, because each 1/4 turn of the screw equates to a certain number of 
'thou' of an inch. I found that VERY interesting because of it's simplicity.
