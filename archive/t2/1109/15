Tony I don't think so if you have a good vacuum advance stocker in place.  I
bought one because the 1600 in my new SC has an 009.  If your stocker is
solid, I'd simply put a good CD ingnition on it, not even a  Pertronix or
other points replacement as the points will last forever (and stay stable
enough forever damn near) with a CDI and you can then always revert to points
if the CD box dies (unlikely but nice.)  My opinion anyway.  Often gain 2-3
mpg with a good CDI.  I have the old Universal I got years ago when Hoover was
on the list and mentioned the same.

Was about $85 at the time, works as well as a Mallory or MSD, they site
doesn't really say what current price is but I bet a lot more, course a 6AL
has gone from $120 to double in the same time...  MSD has a new entry box as
well, a lot cheaper than their 6A/6AL series.   You also see 6A's go cheap on
C-L if you watch.  For all of these,  you need an upgraded (downgraded I guess
inreality) rotor where you remove the resistor, I think John Connely sells
them pre made.
