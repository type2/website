There was a very loud 2-tone green w/blue stripes scheme for 1974:

Yeah I saw the samba paint codes. That's where I got the agave green idea.
It's a beetle color, early years 50's I think.

The loud two tone is awesome! But I think I am going to keep it simple and
camper/surfer themed.

Thanks Jack!
