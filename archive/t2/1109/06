Hmmm, if it was me, I'd stick with the bonehead simple dual carbs, which on 
a personal level I find much more understandable than the voodoo electrics. 
:-) Also, if you give us an idea of the miles on the engine etc, it might be 
a better way for us to make a suggestion. If you really want to bond with 
your son, there is nothing better than doing a rebuild together over a few 
weeks, which also teaches you the ins and outs of your engine. There is 
nothing wrong with mechanical lifters; just adjust them every 3-4 thousand 
miles. Once you've done it a few times, a 1/2 hr. usually covers it. I have 
mechanicals on my 77 Westy 2L and it's not a big deal.
HTH,
Courtney
