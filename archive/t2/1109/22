Subject: Re: [T2] Window seals and painting, which first?

Do the window seals after painting.  The best scenario is to remove the =
windows and seals and deliver the bus to the painter that way.  Sure, =
you'll get bugs in your teeth while driving down there but you'll get a =
better paint job for your buck.  I've done this and BOY IS IT WINDY!  In =
a regular cheapo paint job the shop will just mask the window seals and =
paint the body wherever it's visible.  The result would be that you have =
new paint everywhere except under your window seals.  It's much better =
to have them paint the area where the window seal rests at the same time =
as painting everything else.

Also, by taking out the windows and seals before hand you can fix up =
whatever rust you find there before having the paint job done.

Don't worry about damaging the paint with the window seal.  A good paint =
job that has fully cured won't be hurt a bit by installing seals.  It's =
the way that all the auto builders do it (paint first, seals later).
