I, too, have this problem with new Danish heat exchangers. There is
not more than 0.5mm space between them and the bar. When cranking the
engine the heat exchanger hits the bar making bad noises. If I compare
the heat exchangers to original ones, I can see a bit of difference in
height. I thought it was probably my fault, since I had to file a tiny
bit off to make it seal (according to Richard Atwells advice on his
website), but not this much! Also, I had to work on the "ears" with an
angle grinder to make it clear the fins of the cylinder head.
Furthermore, the sheet metal around the left one was so badly creased,
I had to open it up and re-crease it to make it hold together. I guess
these pieces are just expensive junk fabricated with huge tolerances.
I wish, I'd had good original ones or at least some plain stainless
steel pipes.
Cheers,
Timo
