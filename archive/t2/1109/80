Subject: '76 Kombi sliding door problem

My '76 Riviera (pretty sure now that it's a Rivi, thanks much to all of you
folks) has a sliding door problem. I've looked at the Type2.com archives and
technical articles and I can't find what I need, if my question is already
covered there, if someone would give me the link I will gladly go there to
look it up.

The door comes out of the track at the front end right away when I open it. I
can kind of lean on it and force it back in, and then slide it and slam it
hard with a hand pushing on the back and the front at the same time to get it
closed, but THAT's no fun! (I know all these things have proper names but I
don't know them yet, so please bear with my thingamajig-type descriptions.)
There is a bolt (?) at the top of the door at the front that glides back and
forth in the track. It looks like it has a nut on it that I can adjust to make
that bolt stick up further, would that help? If that's not the right way to
go, what should I do, or where should I go to find out the right things to
do?

I found videos of a major sliding door repair online at
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMuvhYZjjr0&feature=related, that guy rebuilt
all of the track on the back part of the bus where the door slides. Is there
any way I can tell from the symptoms my door is presenting if I have that kind
of problem?

thanks much,
