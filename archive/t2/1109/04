You should be able to get one that will be perfectly adequate for less
than that. One thing I was warned about was that the joint can let go
with a bang. Completely true! Not dangerous but loud when you are right
next to it.

There is a discussion on TheSamba where a particular brand of drag link
was recommended. I can't remember which one except it is Italian.
