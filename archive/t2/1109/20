Subject: re: SVDA

I've been running that Pertronix SVDA for almost a year now with no
problems. Its a quality unit. I installed it with their Flame Thrower coil,
which they say is hotter than 'old blue', but who knows if it makes a
difference. Works just fine for me. I've got a 34pict3 on the vac can, for
my 1600dp, sucks just right (that's dirty).
