You don't give year or engine type or carb type or?????????? so can 
only give basics applicable to all.

Causes of backfire = Lean mix, fuel filter, air leaks, weak or 
intermitent spark, valves. Save efforts by doing things in order, 
adjust valves, compression test, then ignition, then fuel delivery.

Go to any appliance store and get one of the big, triple thick, 
cardboard boxes the refridgerators are shipped in. Nice, big cushy 
pad to lay on. Keeps the mud off you and the parts and tools. Folds 
up to store against the wall. Or just dry it out and burn it in the fireplace.
