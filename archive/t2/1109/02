	Agreed; but aren't there 'hard' and 'hard'?  The senior 
fellas I respect told me, and I've found it works fine, that it's 
best not to 'drive it hard' in the sense of loading it down at wide 
throttle, but letting it rev up as it 'feels to want'.  This is best 
done on a long run, slightly increasing the revs on a fully warmed-up 
motor.  My schoolmate who is by now NZ's senior motoring journo 
(drives a Jegwore D-type  -  tho' a replica built in Timaru) says 
"you run it in fast, you get a fast motor", and all I've experienced 
or heard confirms that.
