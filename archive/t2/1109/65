I don't know how to tell sodium valves, but you could just adjust your 
valves for 0.008" (engine cold) and then heat the bus up and then pull 
the covers off and check for any valve lash.  If you have any, then let 
it cool completely, adjust for 0.006" and test again.  Lash gone, you're 
good to go :)
