Hey Kevin - yeah, I had the same problem many years ago on my 73 and more
recently on my 74 914.  Whatever you do, don't whittle away on the Pertronix
unit. I tried that once and the magnets fell out of it!  As you suspect,
just shave a little of the plastic off the bottom of the rotor and it'll
slid on just fine.  A coarse rasp works well or if you're judicious you can
use a bench grinder to do the deed.
