is sitting behind house, I miss my ride,  will do some body work and 
replumb the entire fuel system while it is idle so won't be wasted time I 
hope.

but had to reconfigure a camping trip scheduled for April and have to do 
the whole break in thing again.... but I guess it could be worse. although 
big hang up may be the severe shortage of bearings.  if anyone has a set 
of 2liter .0020 over size outside/.0010 under on the crank for sale get in 
touch with me. (pretty standard size for line bored/turned crank engine.)
