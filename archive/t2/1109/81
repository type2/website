Subject: Re: [T2] sodium filled valves

I'll go with John on this.  VERY hard to find Sodium Filled Valves these
days and they ain't cheep!  While I don't have the TRW numbers handy, here's
what VW's (Fiche) Part Numbers were:

021 109 611  33mm Sodium for 1.7 (72-74) & 2.0 (76-83)
021 109 611 A 34mm Sodium for 1.8

022 109 612 B  33mm Steel for 1.7 (72-74) & 2.0 (76-83)
022 109 612 D  34mm Steel for 1.8 (74-75)

I picked up 4 Sodium 33mm Valves awhile back.  Not cheep, but they have the
dimple and was going to use them in a project that never came to fruition.
So they're stashed somewhere in my storage room in the TRW box (it's always
"its in a box here somewhere"<grin>).  Guess I'll have to find 'em & dig 'em
out and put 'em on the Samba someday.  Paid about $45 each back then, prolly
sell 'em for that when I find 'em.

Gonna have to wait.  Got Bladder Surgery tomorrow, so I'll be down for a bit
(Bladder Cancer).
