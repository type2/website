Subject: sodium filled valves

Before I go on:

76 Westy, 1.7 L, 009, Weber 32/36 DFEV.  Working on valve adjustment.

Bentley says adjust the intake valves using a .006" guage.  Exhaust is 
.008" for later 1.7 and all 1.8 units because they use sodium-filled 
valves.  (I'd like to know the science behind that but that's the least 
of my worries right now.)  My bus is a Frankenbus with an earlier model 
engine.  How do I tell if it has sodium-filled exhaust valves?  Chances 
are that a rebuilt head does not, correct?  I think Haynes said if 
you're not sure, go with .008" and they may tap but you won't burn the 
valves.  Anybody know how to tell for sure?  Thanks....KR
