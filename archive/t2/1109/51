 I bought the welder at Lowes. For the veteran's out there... If you buy
anything at Home Depot, Lowes, and some Auto Zones, they offer a 10%
discount to veterans. There is a sign on the wall, but it's not in plain
sight. Just show proof of service, a VAMC card will do or a mini DD-214. I
always ask the clerk if they offer a discount to veterans. You'll be
surprised how many say yes!

Not the van...  but the behemoth is getting a motor and trans rebuild even
as I type.  the comment was "I could almost slide a popcicle stick betweenn
the piston and cylinder wall", so I guess it was about time.
