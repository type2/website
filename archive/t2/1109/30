Subject: [T2] What have you done for your bus lately?

Dropped engine and installed new flywheel(reman), Premium Clutch Kit from Bus
depot. Took off the gas tank panel and replaced vent hoses. No more gassy
smells in the garage! So excited!

Taking the whole thing apart slowly for paint. Interior is out! Bumpers are
off. Side covers for sliding door and driver's side removed, but I broke the
tension screw off the sliding door side. Hmm... don't know what I will do to
fix that. Anyway busy weekend.

Anyone ever seen a agave green baywindow? Thinking about paint colors and I
love that color. Probably two tone it with a white. Comments welcome!
