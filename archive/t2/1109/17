I agree with Courtney. Keeping it simple and minimal will reduce the
cost as well. You will spend a lot of money getting together fuel
injection components.

A rebuild will not only be a great bonding experience, but also a
learning experience. At the same time you both can learn how to check
the internal engine parts against specs and see if you can just
replace the damaged parts, which besides teaching you how to evaluate
the engine's condition, will also save you money by purchasing only
the needed parts.

A VW bus is not about power, but about slowing down and enjoying the
getting there as much as the being there!
