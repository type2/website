Hello,

I have a potentially expensive problem and need some advice from  
someone who's been down this road.  My 13 year old son has been a VW  
fan since he was 2 years old, sleeping in my Father-In-Laws' '74  
Camper Bus.  About a year and a half ago, my Father-In-Law decided he  
was done with the VW, so he gave it to my son.

While driving it to our house, we experienced a tapping in time with  
the piston.  We stopped, towed it to my house, restarted it and  
noticed oil residue blowing out of the exhaust.  Although I have not  
pulled it apart, I am guessing that a valve stuck open and is smacking  
into the piston.  It is an 1800cc, dual carbs, manual valves/lifters  
with an Auto trans - therefore at it's best it is a bit of a dog.

My son and I agreed that he would pay for half of the repairs, after  
all it technically is his van.  He's been saving money and we're ready  
to take this on.  I've wrenched on several older vintage cars, so I'm  
well versed in the basics but not specifically with VW's.  I also have  
a local mechanic that works on older VW's, so I have help on the heavy  
stuff if I need it.

The big question is rebuild or replace?  If we rebuild I would rather  
have hydraulic valves & lifters and maybe consider fuel injection to  
improve reliability.  Also, what is your recommendation for getting  
more power?  If we increase the horsepower do I need to do something  
else with the transmission?  And finally, if we replace it, what would  
you recommend?

If this Bus did not mean so much to him I might consider getting rid  
of it, but we love camping and really want to keep the VW tradition  
going. Any advice you can give would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards,
Joel Goldstein
