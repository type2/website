Subject: Re: [T2] sodium filled valves

You don't want the sodium-filled valves IMO.  Supposed to cool a little 
better but the stems are also weaker since they are hollow.  Porsche 
914s had sodium-filled valves, but lo and behold they had fatter stems, 
presumably to make up for the fact that they were hollow.  I bought a 
set of the skinny-stem VW sodium-filled valves many moons ago and ran 
them for about 10K miles.  Noticed that the face of one valve had become 
pitted so took all four out and ran stainless TRW $6.95/ea valves for 
years afterwards with nary a problem.
