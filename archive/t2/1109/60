Subject: Any member is live or work near Watertown, NY?

Hi Everyone,

I live in Canada and I need a part shipped from Arizona.  I'll be
honest the part is a transmission for a Ford not my 76 VW
(Transmission working like new after over 30 years).  I can get it
shipped to Watertown pretty cheap but to get it shipped to Canada is
very expensive so I was wondering if anyone on the list could help me
out.  Shipping to a business would be best but beggars can't be
choosers.

If anyone can help let me know.

Matthew
1976 VW Bus
