I started to tackle the rust on my '69 SC.  Took a wire wheel to the surface
stuff on the front and in the bed and coated it with some stuff that looks
like coffee (lots of creamer) that turns black with it dries. This weekend I
hope to pull the engine to clean up the gunk and put in a new engine seal.

Future things I want to do:
Remove the rust on doglegs, windshield, treasure doors, bed, and a few other
spots
Install sound deadening stuff to the interior
Remove drop-down sides and replace with wood
New interior (seats, headliner, carpet, door panels)
New paint, don't know the color but something bright

Also I may have a chance to take a job in Germany this summer (contractor to
the govt) and I would love to take it over with me so I have alot to do in the
next few months.
