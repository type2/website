Hi Volks,

That is the third one of those failures that I am aware of.

First one was Dennis Jolliffe's 77 "Sondancer", the plug popped in his 
driveway in 2001. Second occurrence was Dave Ireland, on the way home 
from EveryBus in 2002 his bus puked its oil on the campsite as Dave was 
about to roll for home that morning.

Always with an automatic transmission, and always at startup in cold 
weather.

Happy Trails,
