Weber 32/36 DFEV

>Those conversion kits are prone to air leaks. They use the standard Bug
upright engine intake seals, and I have seen lots of those only last a
year or two before leaking. The genuine VW seals, if you can find them,
will last much much longer. Also, as a matter of regular maintenance,
check the head flange bolts for tight, as well as the carb mount nuts.
My guess is more than a 50% chance the backfire issue is due to air
leaks in the intake system. Lots of idle problems are due to same.

I read on The Samba that part of the reason the seals don't last is the
poor mount from the plenum under the carb to the engine which allows the
carb to rock slightly putting stress on the seals. Unfortunately I don't
think there is a simple fix for that. (Apart from ditching the weber! Ha
ha!).

Before I swapped to dual carbs, I experimented with wrapping the inlet
pipes with insulation. I wrapped one pipe and left the other bare. After
a few minutes idling the wrapped pipe was noticeably warmer than the
unwrapped one. When both were unwrapped they only got warm for the first
few inches when the engine was idling. I didn't go any further with my
experimentation but I presume that done properly this could help
overcome the dreaded winter icing.

>Who boy, just the wrong curve for the T-IV engine. Get an original or
an SVDA with the full 25 degree mechanical advance and further vacuum
can advance in there. Difference in drivability is huge.

Totally agree! I "converted" my SVDA to a 009 by blocking off the vacuum
and swapped it back after 2 minutes driving! It was so amazingly bad!
