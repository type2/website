you probably have the 003 auto tranny which has a vacuum triggered shift 
the transmission can be made to operate reliably, if you wish to replace 
it I wouldb highly reccomend considering the 010 auto tranny which is more 
reliable and parts are still avaliable and is a govenor shift tranny. and 
is almostt a drop in fit, you do need to swap the flex shaft linkahge 
between the tranny and the shift rod from the front, may also need to swap 
accelerator linkage too,,

but it is worth the swap.  switching to a manual tranny would be major 
work

congratulations on your new baby
