Subject: Window seals and painting, which first?

I'm very close to taking my '78 tin top in to get some minor body work done
and painted.  But I also need new window seals all around and am not sure in
what order I should get things done.  I think I should put the new seals in
first so I don't damage the new paint.  But then I saw a bunch of resto.
pictures and the glass is always out during a repaint, so I don't want to
install new seals if the painter is going to take the window out anyway.  I'm
sure there is a standard way of doing this I just don't know what it is.

TIA,
chandler
