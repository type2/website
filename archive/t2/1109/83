those doors have about 50 ways to adjust and they need to be pretty close 
to right on.  check the reasons why it won't then get that adjustment

Bentley manual has 7 pages on how to adjust the door..

chapter 1 (Body and Frame)
section 5.11
pages 18-25


good luck it is slow but follow the instructions.
I put a new slider on last year too days to get the adjustments right but 
it works nice now

good luck
