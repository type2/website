and how many trips down that 1/4 mile strip, even 4,000 is barely a 1,000 
miles.  I suspect you want your daily use vehicle to go more than 1,000 
miles

and I doubt you really care how much oil you use in the 1/4 mile. probably 
change it ever run or two also.

there are probably as many different break in methods as there are 
rebuilders but most are pretty close to the same....

if not broken in you will probably have an engine that burns oil and and 
probably won't go as far as it would if you had done it right.....
