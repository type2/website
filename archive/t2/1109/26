	I don't know the answer for sure, but I do see a question: 
should a steering box have (as I suspect) EP 90 gear oil, or SAE 90 
sump oil if that exists?
	EP 90 is not nearly so viscous as would be inferred from what 
you know of, say, SAE 50 sump oil.  There are two viscosity scales, 
contrived so that they rarely if ever overlap in numbers; but can we 
settle this steering box oil question right away?  People who say EP 
doesn't matter are poorly informed.
