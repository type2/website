Subject: Replacing SC bed floor?

So this is something I've never done as the other 3 trucks I've had have been
OK, and I'm wondering...
 
First, I'm stupid to even consider doing this (I know that in advance,) the
thing is replacing the floor would take the '69 from average (can be a nice
driver but not pristine) to truely restoration class.  My intention had NOT
been to do this actually when I got it because aside for the wood strip rivet
holes and some extra holes added for??, it isn't more than lightly surface
rusted, just beat to crap from a life working on a tree farm.  Thing is I
hadn't really noted how good the rest of the bus is until this weekend.  My
inclination is still to just fix the holes, paint the bus, and then spray
bedline the inside of the gates and the bed but I'm wondering.  One of the
gates is going to take some major deconstruction to really straighten as well,
though it isn't really rusted.  Anyway on the floor, how does it all pull,
what would I be getting into here.  Is the steel thicker than standard floor
material repair sections (which I might be able to
 get in Anchorage) as if it is I'd have to order and the shipping is going to
be ludicrous which probably kills the idea.  I may just stud weld the worst
areas and see what some judicious pulling can accomplish.
 
Inquiring (my) mind wants to know from someone who has done it.
 
TIA
 
John
