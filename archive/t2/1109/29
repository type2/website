Subject: Brake Booster, 73 Bus

Hey guys,
 
    I know I've posted about this a couple of times in the past, but with
school, work, and kids, I rarely every get a chance to drive my bus. I just
started it up for the first time in like 6 months because I was selling a
small block chevy that was on a stand tucked behind it in the garage. I
charged the battery the day before obviously, but it started RIGHT up and the
hydraulic lifters hadn't even bled or lost pressure. Awesome!!!
 
Anyway... where can I get a brake booster? The thing is, I don't really want
to send my old one out to have it rebuilt.
 
What I really want to know is... is there ANYWHERE on the net that I can go,
click "Add to Cart" and then click checkout, and suddenly a brand new (or
completely rebuilt) brake booster will show up at my door???
 
 
Thanks guys!!!
