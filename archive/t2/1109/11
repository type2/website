Personally, I'm a fan of the CompuFire, but I'm sure the Pertronix would 
be a great buy, especially if it's already installed.  I have yet to 
re-adjust my timing after years and years and years of running the 
electronic points.  Yes, I've pulled the distributor out and reset the 
timing a few times here and there (because the distributor was removed), 
but it's never varied from it's set point.  Definitely the way to go!
