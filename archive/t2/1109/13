Are you referring to this one:

http://www2.cip1.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=PER-D186504

With description:

"This cast "Flame-Thrower" distributor from Pertronix is not only
affordable but features a custom mechanical advance curve that
delivers optimum performance and driveability. It comes with
Pertronix's famous "Ignitor" ignition module already installed. The
"Igniter" eliminates the moving points so there's nothing to adjust.
You get twice the voltage delivered to the plugs which increases
horsepower while it improves fuel mileage and those spark plugs will
last longer too.For 12 volt electrical systems. Shoud be use with
ACC-C10-5842 Flame Thrower Coil."

That doesn't look or sound like a Bosch distributor with a Pertronix
installed, it sounds like Pertronix is now making their own
distributors.

I tried on of CIP1's Bosch knockoff's a few years back (with the
product label of "Bruck Germany") and it wasn't good.

Perhaps there's some review of this new product on thesamba.

Let the buyer beware. YMMV
