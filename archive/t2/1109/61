Go with the big names. Hobart, Lincoln, Miller, etc. Avoid the no-name 
Chinese welders at all costs. I have a Lincoln 180 220V machine. 
Actually have two b/c I bought one for our shop at work too. Anyhow they 
Lincoln 140 is the same welder but it won't weld the thicker materials 
b/c it doesn't have the amps. For sheet metal it is fine. You MUST use 
gas. I don't think I have done any good reliable welds with flux core 
wire on sheetmetal. Fluxcore is okay for heavier materials. For patch 
panels I use .025" wire, gas, and a low setting on my welder. There is a 
chart inside the door that helps get a starting current/wire speed. 
Adjust from there.

When I bought our two welders I used http://www.weldingmart.com/ and got 
free shipping and a "free" cart. Oh - and no sales tax.

More recently I found that one of our local welding supply stores must 
be hurting a little and selling their Lincolns at similar prices when 
before they were $150 more. Just something to think about. Good to buy 
local b/c they are going to be your gas supplier and can SHOW you what 
you need in person.  Just something to think about.

I just bought a "Morgan" air compressor via Northern Tool. It's a 60 gal 
upright formerly a Kobalt compressor but remanufactured. Saved me ~$100 
over the store bought version. Maybe more compressor than you need but 
I'm sure that "Morgan" has smaller compressors. Bought the extended 
warranty which is longer than the store bought version I think. Have it 
shipped to the store nearest you to avoid any shipping cost.

As for a plasma cutter - again buy big names. I have used a Miller. A 
MUCH cheaper solution would be a "nibbler".

I have the silver one but a different much cheaper brand. You could also 
buy a die grinder:

And the angle version for a sanding disc and accomplish all of the 
cutting you'd need to do for a fraction of the cost of a plasma cutter.

Yeah, I'd rather have the plasma cutter too but it's not in my budget 
right now.

Dunno how long the cheapest Chinese air tools last.
