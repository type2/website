Subject: Re: [T2] valve adjustment

Now that's interesting!  I'm finding nothing in the archives.  I seem to 
remember that you wait 'til the number one intake closes and just as two 
(intake?) starts to come up, that is TDC.  But it fires 1-4-2-3 so I'm 
not sure about that.  Anybody???  Thanks....KR
