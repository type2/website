And that's for the piping on the inside of the bus.  The outside of the 
bus has always been standard rubber propane hose just like you use for 
your BBQ (with crimped ends, of course).  Unless it was completely 
enclosed, I wouldn't want to use copper pipe on the outside of the bus 
in the event that something struck it at high speeds, it could easily 
puncture it.  Plus, making those bends around the bottom of the bus 
to/from the tank would be major PITA.
