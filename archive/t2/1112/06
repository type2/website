I've always installed them dry.  Just make sure the manifolds and cylinder
head is CLEAN and dry and the gasket material on the block(s) are in good
shape as well as clean. Never had one leak yet in 25 years or so.

This is even more important on 79-83 California Buses & Vanagons that run an
O2 sensor.  Some people will use Permatex that is not rated for use with O2
Sensors and ruin 'em.

YMMV
