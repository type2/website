Subject: re:WW T2 accel pedal lever fix

I guess WW doesn't really care about this issue, or they are just selling
back stock, because I had the same issue and received the same response, and
I did the same thing-I didn't install the replacement, but rather modified
the replacement.

 

Here is another pic of my install.
