Also, for those that are interested, I'm doing some research to see if
it's possible to get quad CHT logging.  This would mean that you could
get the cheap under-the-plug sensors and one box that could log all of
the information and have it available on your laptop.  This is already
available for EGT, but it would be really cool if it could happen with
CHT as well.  And the cool part is this is all totally independent of
the MegaSquirt - it's an additional I/O board that can work in tandem
(and communicate) with the MS, or just function and datalog on it's own
- very cool stuff!!

I'll keep ya posted with with my progress.  I'm really looking forward
to be able to start and log some of this temperature information with
all of my other data logs as I've never had a way to correlate
temperature information with engine information (never been any
appropriations for CHT with the MegaSquirt).  While CHT logging isn't
for certain just yet, EGT is probably the next best, if not better, as
most of the top head builders will say to watch EGT because that's what
really kills our heads.
