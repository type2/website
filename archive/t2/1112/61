Subject: RE: [VB] wiper motor upgrade?

Hey Chris,

Yeah I will probably go back to the original armature, I just figured while
I had everything apart, and it just takes a couple minutes to swap
armatures-why not do that.

I'm trying to figure out if I have a bad armature, or if it's possible that
the armature can fit, but not really be compatible, and therefore not work. 

Just trying to get some knowledge before calling the place where I bought
it.

I do get a good bit of rain here in Boston, and remember when running the 6V
motor on the 12V system, it always made me a bit uneasy-sounded like the
thing was not going to make it.

Hi Kevin,

I would vote for keeping the 6V motor. Thats what I did. Nice wiper speed. 
Been that way for 35 year now. Of course I live in So. Cal. with little 
rain. I did use the bus as a daily driver that way for almost 20 years.
