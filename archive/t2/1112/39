If you had a leak in your brake booster line, then yes, you'd have a 
funky fuel mixture.  However, it's a closed system so anyone that usess 
manifold vacuum would have a big problem if you had a leak EFI or carbs. 
  I'd tie as many together because then you'd get more consistent vacuum.

Heck, if you're gonna pull the manifolds to tap them, I'd just tap all 
four and connect them together. Then you have clean, consistent vacuum. 
  Besides the labor involved, it's still cheaper and more reliable than 
some electric setup.  Plus you don't have to fiddle with relays and 
what-not.
