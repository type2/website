When you crank it you ARE deflecting the AFM flap due to the manifold 
suction!  That's why you can jumps start a FI bus if battery is good. 
Superfluous to do the screwdriver thing unless you have dead battery but 
can check the plug contacts on the AFM with an ohm meter.  However I 
have seen faulty afm contacts (likely due to backfire) that had to be 
bent into the right position to make contact- this requires removing the 
top of the AFM.
