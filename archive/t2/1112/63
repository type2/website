Subject: Re: [T2] lights, locks & more lights...

I just went through my stash of random parts from the PO. I found two
headlight trim rings, with a drain hole at the bottom. A left and a right.
But these also have three holes on the front. One to hold it on, and two to
adjust the headlight. Sort of like the ones on my '65, except my '65 ring
has a big tab on it, that the retaining screw goes through. I don't really
know if this is right for my bus-lookslike it would work for some different
type of light bulb scenario than the one I have.

 

Was writ:

Isn't there a hole drilled in the bottom somewhere? Seems like I remember
the Beetle versions being hole free but the bus versions having a drain
hole. (???)
