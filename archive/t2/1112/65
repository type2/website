All
I had a chance to drop
by and see Steve yesterday and he does have alot of
stuff to give away, bug/bus parts, camper stuff and the buses too.  Both buses
have some
rust and need some cleaning and TLC but for the price it's a great
deal for the
right person. If I had a place the '73 camper would have been
coming with me
but it just couldn't happen.

 

I intend to drop by again and
pick up anything
that doesn't get claimed before he tosses it all out.  Hate
to see that
happen.  So if your in the DC area drop by and take a look.

 
Also Richard, apparently he has some plaid
fabric that he put aside for you a
few years back, drop me an e-mail and I'll
pick it up for you.

out of my life! Included in this offer are a couple gas heaters, a pair of

tents, some cabinets, and two complete non-running buses ('73 and '80)."
