I'm in the process of replacing all my fuel lines while the engine is out, 
the old ones are less than ten years old so were not a real worry but I 
have been trying to find one of those valves and have not had any real 
luck, because FI you would probably need two of them really

also was looking for a quick release fuel line connector so making taking 
the engine out easier etc. can't find those either

ideas????
