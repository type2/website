Wild.  I read some follow up to this and didn't see the same comment
that I was going to make:

I have the exact same configuration on my '71 Westy.  The left trim ring
held all the water and gunk and the right trim ring let everything out
through a small hole in the bottom.  Turning my left trim ring upside
down, it was just another right trim ring, I think, because the hole was
then on the bottom.  Must've been replaced at some point by a PO.  I
assume there's an actual LEFT and a RIGHT trim ring, and not just one
size fits all?

It's never been a high priority to replace, since I have the Bus under
cover now, and don't tend to drive it in the rain.  But eventually it
will rust, so I might as well replace it.

--When I removed the trim ring on the passenger side, a ton of water
poured
out. No water on driver's side. Apparently the water was stuck behind
the
trim ring.
