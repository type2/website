It's a 2.0L aircooled engine.
The engine case number
( not the number on the shroud)
would be helpful.
Measure the clutch disc at 228 mm.
The Vanagon aircooled engine is 2.0
The watercooled Vanagon engine is 2.1
Yours could be a "big bore" 2.1 ( or 2.01:) aircooled,
and you verify that by measuring the piston diameter,
but the flywheel is the same.
