For most LPG installations that I've seen it's copper tubing all the way.  If it were my bus, I'd replace most of where that hose run with copper tubing
usually 8mm or 10mm diameter tubing will suffice.  Use pipe clips to mount the tube out of the way where it won't get all banged up.
Careful with bending the tube.  A general rule is that the minimum bend radius should be 4 times the tube tube outer diameter.
If you need tighter bends, then get some brass elbows with compression fittings.  I like compression fittings because no soldering is involved to make or break the joints, but it's up to you.
For the terminal connection to the tank, you can use a suitable length of LPG hose to make life easier when changing out tanks.  
You just need a fulham nozzle (that fits the diameter of your LPG hose) with a compression fitting to mate with the copper tubing.  
Cinch up the hose with some o-ring clips or some properly-sized jubilee clips.
The other end of the hose is for you to connect as will.
If the tank is permanent, then go copper all the way if practical.
This also goes for the terminal connections for your gas appliances.

Mix some dish soap and water.  Apply it to your joints then turn on your gas supply and look for bubbling.  If you see any then you have a leak.
Either tighten up the joint a little or remake it.  You shouldn't need to use thread tape (teflon tape) with compression joints.  Either the compression
joint makes the seal or it doesn't.  Using teflon tape may hide an improper joint.

You should be able to get most of this at a plumbing supply store or maybe a DIY store like Lowes or something.

If  you decide to go copper then, I would recommend taking a look at some handy PDF leaflets from the UK Copper Board.
There's some good tips on general copper installation as well as specifics.  From allowances in measuring to to how to make compression joints.
Take a gander at http://www.ukcopperboard.co.uk/literature/tipslist.shtml


DISCLAIMERS:
- I have no qualification in LPG installation.  These are tips from my own DIY experience and research.
- I have no affiliation with the UK Copper Board.
- Some of the UK terminology used (Fulham nozzle, Jubilee clips) may not be suitable for your location
- If you blow yourself up, please have the foresight to record a video so it can be posted to youtube for edutainment of others.
-  If my e-mail isn't clear, I'd be happy to clarify
- Good luck and happy trails!

Subject: [T2] Hose going from propane tank is rubber with radiator hose  clamp???

I've been looking at my propane tank setup, and it appears to have a rubber hose coming off the tank up into the cabin to the propane stove.
