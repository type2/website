If you can get the rust STOPPED you're fine.

I bought this book:

How to Restore Volkswagen Bus: Your Step-by-Step Illustrated Guide to 
Body and Interior Restoration Microbus, Camper, Kombi & Transporter All 
August 1967 to October 1979 Models Does Not Cover Rear Bodywork of 
Pick-up Models (ISBN: 9781845840938)  by Paxton, Mark

They restore a blue British delivery van that I would have passed on due 
to it's rust and do a good job.

Worth a look for anybody fighting the rust bug.
