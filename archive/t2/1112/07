Hello James,
My 76 Westy did this last summer about 3 times, and eventually got 
diagnosed with "failing fuel pump." Replaced fuel pump and problem stopped. 
Fuel pump was costly. One tip-off was no fuel smell ay tailpipe after 
repeated cranking with failure to start. Diagnostic test of fuel pressure 
verified failing fuel pump.

'77 Westy, stock F.I.

We had to leave our bus last night and get a ride home.  It turns over fine
but doesn't seem like it is trying to start, maybe an electrical issue.  It
is near the bottom of the tank so we added about 1 gallon of gas, and
nothing.

About three weeks ago it did this .... Before we could fix it, it started 
up the next day.
