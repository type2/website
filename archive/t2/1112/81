Subject: Urgent need flywheel for 78 2.1 FI bus - Sacramento, CA

Hi volks:

I'm in the middle of an overhaul of my 78 westy and my friend (the REAL 
mechanic!) just called to let me know the flywheel is cracked.  We need 
a replacement, hopefully within 3 hours of Sacramento by car (me driving 
of course).

It's a 1978 CAL 2.1 FI..  I have a recommendation for a place called 
Norcal Relics, in Woodland, Ca but the number I was given is bad. 

Right now I will take new or used (with no crack).

Please email or call my cell if you have any recommendations.  I'll call 
Busboys and Busted Bus if I can't find one closer.

Not urgent as much for me but my friend wants his driveway back!

Thanks,

BEN
