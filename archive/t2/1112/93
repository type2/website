Hi LJ,

The pop-top paint article you mention can be found on the T2List here:
http://www.type2.com/library/camper/poppaint.htm

I originally found it here: http://www.rivieraregistry.com/links.php

Lots of info (-at-) rivieraregistry.com.

A copy of the sales brochure can be seen here:
http://wetwesties.tripod.com/riviera/index1.html

or here: http://www.rivieraregistry.com/lit.php

Some Rivera background info can be read here:

I'll look up my source for the pinchwelt - but I had to buy it in bulk. You
might be able to find a hardware store to order a specific length.

Here's a a few pinchwelt pics:

 What I would love to find is more info about the Rivieras.
