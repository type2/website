There are 12 volt solenoid valves that you could attach to the fuel line 
as it comes out of the gas tank (before any rubber lines). $50 or less.

When the 12 volts was turned off through the key or a toggle switch it 
would spring closed and stop fuel. This would seriously improve your 
chances of fighting a broken fuel line fire because the stock gas tank 
design simply gravity feeds the fuel right onto the ground. You could 
graft in fuel pump that pumps out of the top of the tank so that if the 
lines ruptured the pump would stop and no more fuel would reach the 
ground or fire - no gravity fed gasoline supply!

This has got to be the worst part of the Type II design. The rest I can 
live with happily.

Have lots of fun with your Riveria!!!
