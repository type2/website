 Hi James,
             The Bosch FI fuel pumps do not like to run dry.  Even if you have
"some" fuel the pumps may starve due to vehicle attitude or cornering forces. 
They need the fuel to keep cool.  This is probably true of all immersed fuel
pumps.  Running them dry can precipitate failures even some time after you
have raised the fuel level. AMHIK. jon
