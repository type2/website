Subject: Hose going from propane tank is rubber with radiator hose

I've been looking at my propane tank setup, and it appears to have a rubber hose coming off the tank up into the cabin to the propane stove. It is held on by a rad clamp which seems NOT to be ideal to me. What did these originally look like? To use the words from a good old rock song, I think I'm "Flirtin with Disaster"?
