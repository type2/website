Yes, that I do know.  The reason I mention it is that it's much easier 
than running wires to the pump and it tests a lot of circuitry in the 
process.

Again, another reason to test the AFM.  If it's faulty and doesn't kick 
over the pump when it's deflected, then you'll know why it's not starting :)
