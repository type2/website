What did you build? I bought an Acer Revo to put in the '70.

At 7" x 7" x 1.5" it should mount just about anywhere. 

I've bought a plain laptop/slim SATA DVD burner and built a USB power
cable for it and god got an eSATA cable for the DATA line. Attach as
needed, store in a cabinet otherwise.

I'm looking at custom building a small (7" to 10") touch-screen display
for the front to use for GPS and music management plus a USB video
capture device for cameras. I'll dual boot XP and Linux until I get
everything I want running in Linux then I'll dump the XP.

I'll keep a long HDMI cable in a cabinet and if I plan to watch movies
on a trip I'll load up one of my desktop 22" monitors for use in the
back.
