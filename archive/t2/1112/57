Definitely not cool!  I can't remember my setup, but I think there is a 
rubber hose with clamped-on fittings on either end that runs from the 
stove down to the floor, at which point there is a bulkhead fitting, and 
then another rubber hose with clamped-on fittings runs from the bulkhead 
to the tank.

You can always go to an RV shop and they can fab up a new hose for you 
to whatever length you need.  That's what I did for the one under my bus.

I'd highly recommend shutting off the gas and do not use it until you 
get a proper hose!
