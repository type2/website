Subject: RE: [T2] RE: Starting out: general questions

So what does that pinchwelt stuff DO, what's it FOR? Is its purpose to hold
the edge of the fiberglass nice and tight, firm it up, maybe, so it is
encourage to sit right in the gutter?

I left the top up and it snowed last night, just a little. Surely that can't
hurt anything, but now I won't put it back down until it's completely dry. But
also will get someone's help, maybe two someones, so we can guide it down into
the gutter track on each side so it sits right.

thanks for links for more Riviera info.
