Subject: electric vacuum pump

I am running dual IDF 40's and an thinking about connecting up the brake
booster again.
My manifolds have no vacuum access. So I look in the achieves and found
nothing on electric vacuum pumps.
Since the electric vehicles and some diesel's use them,  has anyone here
experimented with them?
Of the people I have talked too, most said to leave it disconnected, they
did...not worth the cost.
I think I would rather work the issue and solve it.
I can find them used for about $150 bucks.

I have been looking and the newer Beetle TDI, Audi A4's and others...
even GM , Ford, Volvo and RV's have had or have a supplemental vacuum pump,
some electrical some mechanical.

The big issue is cost....speed shops sell them for about $300 for the guys
with big cam's in there hotrods.
They have little or no vacuum at idle (if you want to call it an idle), but
that is way overkill for our buses.
Not to mention the pump noise of the bigger units.
Any ideas?
