In addition to what the others have said about how to test the pressure, 
have you verified that the pump is actually running?  An easy way to do 
this is remove your air filter, turn on your ignition, and stick a long 
screwdriver in the intake to deflect the flap.  Do you hear the pump 
running?

Even if your pressure is low, it should still fire once or twice or 
idle.  I had an intermittent blocked port in my fuel tank (fuel injector 
bottle foil) and it would cause the engine to hiccup under acceleration, 
but it would idle fine.

Did you try the starter fluid to see if it kicks over?
