Thanks Chris, I appreciate the info. I'm going to hide in the garage
tomorrow and get to work! I'm so close to finishing the engine I can taste
it!! Or maybe I just bit my fingernails and found some grease!

Just make sure that the headers are straight and not warped.

I run a file over both ports of the pipe at once to see if the edge files
clean equally and simulatnoeuly. Plcing those ends ona  glass top table
would do the same. Shine a light towards you on the other side of the pipe.
If you see light leaking through it is time to file them flat. 
I did a long winded post in the archives about this once upon a time. 
Look up warped headers.
