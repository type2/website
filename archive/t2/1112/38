They currently don't have a port.

BUT.....if I tap into just one side of each manifold does that not make
those two cylinders run differently than the other two?
These intakes have direct routes to each cylinder.
The two you tap off, lets say #1 and #3 for example,
would have a lean condition compared to #2 and #4,
even with the check valve, right?
I think I would have to tap off of all 4 and tie them all together, I may be
wrong.
