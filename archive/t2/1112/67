It's pretty sad right now.  I have it leaned out a lot so it doesn't run 
that great - I've just been so busy that I haven't had a chance to 
really dedicate much time to tuning it (it's been like this for at least 
a year .. hehe).  I was going to do a little bit of tuning in the next 
few days to at least richen it up a hair so it's not bucking quite as 
much.  I just don't want to get it too close to stoich because then like 
you said a while back, I run the risk of one cylinder going hotter than 
the others and frying my heads, and I have no way of monitoring it. 
Plus, I'm a bit paranoid about these heads because I spent a pretty 
penny on them..

But yeah, it's going to be interesting to see the temperature variations 
of each cylinder before I do any injector trim adjustments.  I just had 
the injectors cleaned and flow tested not too long ago so we'll also see 
how much that helped.
