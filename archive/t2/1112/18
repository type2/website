Looks like your outrigger / jacking point.

See item 14 in the following page:
http://www.vwheritage.com/vwh/VW-Camper-Van-Parts/Bus-Parts-1968-79/Chassis-Parts/?templateID=vwh

That might be one of that parts you need.  Unfortunately it's in the UK, but there may be a US supplier somewhere.

If you want photos of underbody repair work, then browse on over to this thread on the VWKD forums:
http://vwkd.co.uk/bb/viewtopic.php?t=1378

This guy has done a LOT of metal work here and he even touches on the areas in your photo.
Sidebar:  As much as I love the aircooled lump in my bus, some of the alternate engine conversions on the VWKD forums have me browsing the forums for hours.

Hope this helps!

It looks like this van was not very well maintained bodywise from the P.O.
I've tried to keep the rusting under control by limiting the van's salt intake
in the winters, but after installing the hard start relay and working on the
cv boots, I discovered another rust area. I'm wondering if this van is getting
too far gone to redo. I've put a picture up at flickr to show you what i
discovered with some judicious use of a screwdriver. This is behind the
passenger side wheelwell. Is there a repair panel for this? Anyone seen any
pics of this section being redone?
