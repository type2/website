Subject: quad EGT AND quad CHT

Looks like it's going to be possible to do both quad EGT and quad CHT!!

Here are some of the features of the base I/O board:

"the board is based on an 8-bit Freescale microcontroller that has 24 
12-bit ADC channels, 10 timer channels, CAN, 2 SCIs, 2 SPIs, 2 IICs and 
more with a 24MHz bus speed. So there is room for expandability. This 
board has the CPU, CAN transceiver, power supply, and 4 VR conditioners 
with differential inputs all mounted on the board in SMDs. It has 
circuits for through hole components for 6 high current drivers, 6 low 
current drivers that can be configured as either inputs or outputs 
(default will be 3 inputs and 3 outputs), and 8 ADC conditioners. All of 
these go to a DB37 and the high current drivers have their own 12V and 
ground connections separate from the rest of the board. And all the CPU 
I/Os are routed to headers. There is also a small 1"x1" proto area."

And the add-on logger+ board (that can do both EGT and CHT):

"There is a second board, which will be ready soon, with an RTC 
(real-time clock), 3-axis accelerometer, USB connection, an optional GPS 
module, and an SD card. There are also 8 more ADC circuits which can be 
used for generic analog inputs or for EGT measurements using optional 
dedicated EGT amplifier chips.  The idea with the SD card is that this 
would make it a 2-board standalone datalogger."

This has a lot of potential to change the landscape of all those 
aftermarket CHT vendors that are charging an arm and a leg for data that 
you can only see, but do nothing with.  The possibility with just this 
board alone (with the MegaSquirt) is quite awesome.

This is all just too cooooool!!!
