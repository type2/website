Subject: Urgent need flywheel for 78 2.1 FI bus - Sacramento, CA  UPDATE

Hi all:

I just spoke to BustedBus.  Apparently my bus came with a 2.0 FI.  The
2.1 is from a Vanagon.  Is there a way for me to tell if the engine is a
2.0 or 2.1?  the PO said it was a 2.1 BAP rebuild.  The engine is out so
if someone has a picture that would work to.

Thanks,

BEN

Hi volks:

I'm in the middle of an overhaul of my 78 westy and my friend (the REAL
mechanic!) just called to let me know the flywheel is cracked.  We need
a replacement, hopefully within 3 hours of Sacramento by car (me driving
of course).

It's a 1978 CAL 2.1 FI..  I have a recommendation for a place called
Norcal Relics, in Woodland, Ca but the number I was given is bad.

Right now I will take new or used (with no crack).

Please email or call my cell if you have any recommendations.  I'll call
Busboys and Busted Bus if I can't find one closer.

Not urgent as much for me but my friend wants his driveway back!

Thanks,

BEN
