Just make sure that the headers are straight and not warped.

I run a file over both ports of the pipe at once to see if the edge 
files clean equally and simulatnoeuly. Plcing those ends ona  glass top 
table would do the same. Shine a light towards you on the other side of 
the pipe. If you see light leaking through it is time to file them flat. 
I did a long winded post in the archives about this once upon a time. 
Look up warped headers.
