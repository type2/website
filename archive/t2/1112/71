I didn't take any other pictures during the install.  It went in pretty
easily once I sat down and really teased out the instructions.  I had to
cut a path in the center support piece (the one that fits around the
handbrake lever) and make a couple other minor mods, but overall it went
in pretty nicely.  It also has the added benefit of holding the front
vinyl panels in place, which had a tendency to otherwise flop over.

It's also become a great framework to mount equipment to.  On the
current implementation I have an inverter, a couple 12v plugins, a small
computer, a wireless access point, a couple other widgets, and soon a CB
will installed there was well.  At some point I should get some photos
of my setup posted somewhere.
