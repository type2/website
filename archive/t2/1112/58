Subject: Throwing stuff away

Volks,

I am cleaning out my basement and garage.  I am, especially, going to get
rid of a boatload of VW parts.  If you want any of these parts, please come
by my house in Alexandria VA.  Anything you want, take!  Free! just get it
out of my life! Included in this offer are a couple gas heaters, a pair of
tents, some cabinets, and two complete non-running buses ('73 and '80).  I
have to get rid of this stuff one way or anther and having it all hauled off
would be a shame, but it will be done.  Please email me if you want to come
by.

Steve Dolan
