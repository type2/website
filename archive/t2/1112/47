What I ended up doing is drilling out the hole, and installing a clevis pin
on the WW model.

This is working fine so far...

I may check it again soon, to make sure everything looks ok under there.

You could drill and tap the WW part and replace the pin with a shoulder bolt

if you can find one with the right diameter and length. The thread likely 
would be long enough to go thru and spin on a locking nut to make sure it 
does not come loose. One could also cut off the head of the shoulder bolt 
and cut in a snap ring groove for the E washer. I do this on my drill press 
with a hack saw blade.
