much easier, safer, and fulfills a diagnostic purpose if you take off 
the air filter and deflect the AFM flap with a screwdriver.  That way 
you know that part of the double relay circuit is working correctly and 
there's no need to crawl under the bus.  Plus, it tests that the wiring 
is good instead of bypassing the harness, and you don't need to crank 
the engine over.  Also, if you crank the engine and the pump doesn't 
run, then you know the other part of the double relay isn't functioning. 
  Lastly, if it starts when you deflect the flap but doesn't start when 
the flap isn't deflected, then you know the circuit that is supposed to 
supply power during cranking isn't working...
