Here is a thought.
I see the broken off pin on the WW part and the worn out rusted original. 
The CIP part just looks odd and not right.
You could drill and tap the WW part and replace the pin with a shoulder bolt 
if you can find one with the right diameter and length. The thread likely 
would be long enough to go thru and spin on a locking nut to make sure it 
does not come loose. One could also cut off the head of the shoulder bolt 
and cut in a snap ring groove for the E washer. I do this on my drill press 
with a hack saw blade.
