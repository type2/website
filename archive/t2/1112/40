Mike's right about the closed system. The only time you would draw any air
in is when the booster needs a recharge.

I ran a '72 with a 1.8 liter and dual Dellortos for years with only one
manifold attachment. Never had any problems with vacuum or running lean.

I'm not sure how much of a difference it will make in the performance of the
engine if you tap all four and tie them together, but there are reasons they
are separated.

Just drill and tap one manifold. If you don't like the way it works out, you
can always do the rest later.
