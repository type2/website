Subject: Accelerator pedal difference

Hi,

Working on a '75, went to lube up my accelerator pedal tonight and
ended up breaking off one of the metal loops that the pin goes
through. No problem, I pull the pedal off my '71 parts bus. But,
despite the fact that vendors sell a 68-79 pedal, I'm noticing some
difference between the pedals. For one the "stop" where the pedal hits
the floor is much shorter on the '71 pedal. Also, the hole where the
linkage connects is in a different spot (lower down the pedal towards
the floor).

Haven't taken it for a test drive but it seems I'm not hitting the end
of travel for the linkage on the carb end (single Webber 32/36).
Anyone see any problems if I hit the end of travel of the carb before
I hit the pedal stop on the floor? I suppose a simple soution would to
simply be to add some slack to the cable.

Collective thoughts on the year differences and interchangeability?
