If you don't have a pressure gauge, attach a long hose to that T in the 
fuel rail and check the volume of fluid pumped out-in the words of John 
Muir, a beercan full in ten seconds.  Do this both while cranking as if 
trying to start, and by running a wire directly from the battery 
terminal on the starter directly to the positive terminal on the fuel 
pump.( You do have a test wire of at least 16g 4 ft long with alligator 
clips on the ends?) If it works only via the latter, then power is not 
getting to your pump.  I can tell the pump is working using the wire and 
LISTENING for the pump "buzzing" and gas being returned to the tank 
through the pressure regulator.
