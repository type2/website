For fuel injection, on the left injectors fuel rail is a nipple. 
Remove the screw and hook up a hose to your fuel pressure gauge. You 
can also pull the "tee" fitting at the cold start injector for 
hookup, as long as the motor is warm enough to not need the cold 
start function to start.

For carbs, just pull the fuel line and crank the starter. If it puts 
out more than a teaspoon or 2 of dribble in 5 seconds, you're good to go.
