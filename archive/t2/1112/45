Subject: Accelerator Pedal Difference

I don't know anything about your year VW, but I did recently replace the
accelerator pedal linkage on my '69 singelcab.

I had all sorts of problems with fit, and parts from vendors.

Here is a pic of 3 different linkages, and original, one from Wolfsburg West
and one from CIP1, the replacements were both supposed to fit my bus. You
can see the angle is different on the repro from cip 1. The WW one broke
about a week after install.

I also noticed one of the kits came with a pedal-but it was plastic, so I
didn't use it. My floor has some holes in it, that look like they were for
some pedal linkage connection, but are no longer used, as the new connector
is shorter.

Hope that info helps a bit.
