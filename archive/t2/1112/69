Hi Tim,

Just missing some background here. Before you got back on the list
there were some long threads about this article at GAMI:

http://gami.com/articles/bttfpart1.php

Normally when we say lean is hotter, the term is relative, meaning
"leaner", but still on the rich side of stoichiometry. The GAMI
article talks about crossing over to the lean side of Lambda where
lean mixtures run cooler and cooler until combustion fades out due to
lack of fuel, which is where Mike's bucking is coming from.
