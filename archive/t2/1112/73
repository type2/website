Subject: Type 4 Engine/Parts for Sale in San Diego

Hey Volks!

I recently finished installing my new-ish engine and have no use
or space for the old one. So it's up for sale. It is a 
Porsche914 1.7 engine,
case stamped EA010941 - A.K.A
Volkwagen Type IV 1700. It has a blown #1
cylinder and valves but pretty much everything else is in good shape.
Obviously, the engine is not running. With that said, it has
some very usable
parts. 
 
Left side Head, Cylinders and Pistons, Push Rods and Tubes, Rocker
Arms, Valve Springs etc. Fan and Fan Housing, Air Flaps and Control Arm,
Alternator, Oil Cooler, Oil Filler w/ Cap and Dipstick, 215mm Flywheel for
Porsche 914 with matching Clutch and a Brand
New never used 215mm Clutch Disc,
and more that Ibm sure Ibm forgetting. Happy to sell individual parts but
would prefer you take it all.

 for pictures, here's the link to the Craig's
List ad.

I also have
the Heat Exchangers available for sale.

Willing to trade. Looking for:
Exhaust Manifolds without heat exchangers, Cooling Tin, Tail Lights, Front
Turn Signals and some other stuff.

Make me an offer.

Thanks guys! -Peace
