Subject: Re: [T2] Heater boxes

I have run without heater boxes for over 10 years now and have an oil temp 
guage and have noticed no difference in the engine temps, neither higher 
or lower.

now you do have to get the "fiddly" bit of tin above the push rod tubes in 
place that can't be removed but pretty much everything below that is gone. 
have duplicated the pipes exactly so distances etc are the same and as I 
have a 78 I replace them with a 74 system and muffler as they are better 
and cheaper.

YMMV
