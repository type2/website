Subject: RE: [T2] lights, locks & more lights...

Yeah, I thought I remember reading on the list a long time ago about holes
in something or other around the headlight bucket. I thought it was in the
seal-not in the chrome ring. But then again there are no seals there at all,
but I think maybe there should be. I don't think I want to drill holes in
the chrome ring, I'll see if I can find the original rings, these look like
they were replaced by the PO.

As for the back up lights, just installing a ground to them helped, and now
they work.

Tailights not blinking...
I will try to clean up the grounds on the bulbs. I was just wondering if the
fact that these seemed to stop working after I disengaged the steering
column or is the problem more likely in the relay, or at the lights. I guess
the question is: If I hear the relay clicking, and my front signals are
going but the dash pod light is not flashing, and the taillights are not
blinking-where is the problem most likely to be found. Oh yeah, the tail
lights do light up-which makes me think the ground is fine back there. They
just don't come on when I am 'turning'. 

I am online to two locksmiths found on the list, both with great
reviews-Gabe & Steve. I'll see how it works out, so far I have learned that
they can't all be keyed alike.

Thanks for the suggestions...
