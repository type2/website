Hi Ben,

The Vanagon air-cooled engine has a different crankcase breather
configuration. On the bay window bus, you have the open square top
that you clip a breather box onto.

On the Vanagon, you have a closed top with a hole that you slip the
"Top Hat" style breather into.

 2.1 is from a Vanagon.  Is there a way for me to tell if the engine is a
 2.0 or 2.1?  the PO said it was a 2.1 BAP rebuild.  The engine is out so
 if someone has a picture that would work to.
