Subject: EGT and stuff!

I just ordered 4 exhaust gas temperature sensors for the bus!  I'll try 
and get them installed in the next few weeks (will need to weld the 
fittings on).  Then I gotta wait for the needed MS3 expansion board 
(MS3X) to be released as that will allow me to tune the output of each 
injector independently.  I'll also be ordering the thermocouple 
interface and the I/O board to allow me to bring in all of these EGT 
inputs into the MS.  At some time or another I'll throw my second WB02 
sensor on there, but I haven't had a chance to do that yet.

Anyways, when I get that all up and running, it should be a fun 
experiment to test out the stuff in the GAMI article.  The I/O board 
that I'm looking to get also has an accelerometer and GPS, but I'm not 
quite sure how I can use those just yet...
