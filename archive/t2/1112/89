FWIW, The ASUS T91 9" convertible is worth a look, drops a couple of 
small features but it's a very small device with a 9" touch screen 
already on it, works OK and if fairly cheap. While on the subject, many 
of the 19" LCD TVs coming out now are driven off an external 12v power 
supply, got one for a friend's caravan, so you could have a TV as well as 
watching movies off the computer.
