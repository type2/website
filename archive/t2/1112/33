yes especially the two small openings in the bottom of the fan housing, 
gotta block those.  but basically remove all the heating stuff.

plug all the cooling holes and you should be good to go.

lets see
. the pieces above the pushrod tubes remain.
. block two big holes in tin from aux blower ducts
. block two 2x3 inch holes in bottom of fan housing.

can't think of anything else at the moment.
