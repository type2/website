Hi Volks,

I'm hoping to recondition and install a BA-6 heater in my bus before the
snow flies, but I need a wiring diagram to bench-test the heater before
installation.

The links to this info at type2.com are currently down... if anyone can
p-mail me a working link or the relevant info I'd appreciate it.

Last night we drove home from a campout and I discovered it's already
getting decidedly nippy in these parts late at night.

Thanks!
