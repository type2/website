Joshua,

On my '70 the table utilizes the jump seat as the support, so in otherwords,
its level when its flipped over and resting on the jumpseat.  I can e-mail
you a picture if you want.

The interior worktable (1971 Campmobile) which is attached to the
refrigerator/sink, will not fully extend, instead running into the
rear-facing
passenger seat. What is going on? Could one or both be non-stock parts,
refrigerator incorrectly installed, etc. ? I'm clueless.
BTW- I'm also looking for original or repro curtains, the ugly beige,
offwhite, yellow plaid type.
