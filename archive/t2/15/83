Thanks for all the help everybody, but I still have
one question, that is: what about the pressed out
portion of the caliper piston?  No one addressed
whether its OK to have one side up and one side down. 
Everything I understand equals that both sides should
be down.  But again, everything I understand also says
that the pads should have a pressed out portion to
meet the piston.  What gives?
