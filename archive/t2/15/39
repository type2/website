   I just got the word and I will have the samples this weekend for NEW BUS
FLOORMATS.
   I will have late 59 (forward shifter) to 67 floormats and also 1968 to
1973 floormats.
   The samples will available for Viewing at Jerome and the container is
going to arrive at the end of September.
   All the molds for the mats were made off of NOS parts that I supplied to
the manufaturer and are EXACT copies of the originals. For all you Bay bus
owners this should make you happy as these mats haven't been avaiable for
years!

ps. Early 55 to 59 mats will also be available in the near future (will be
in next container)
