Subject: Another 009 related question

Following the recent 009 thread, this has reminded me of a question I asked
some time ago and don't think ever got an answer to.
A few months back I decided it would be a good idea to obtain a rebuild kit
for my distributor - nothing wrong with it but the bearings are getting
slack.  I phoned at least two Bosch specialists and was told they couldn't
get hold of any parts for it.  Does anyone know what parts are common
between the 009 and the various vac advance (+ retard) dizzys?  Then we
could all buy 009s to convert to vacuum or use for parts.
