Subject: Re: [T2] adjusting my weber progressive carb

Gee, my "when will it ever die" 78 with 227,500 kmi on its engine uses a
quart per fillup.....and I'm running 20 psi oil pressure at 3000 rpm
when 240 degr!  Yes it's overdue, but I'm playing the game of "how long
will it last" and will quit only if a cyl. is 20 lbs lower than the
others.  (125-140 range now).  18mpg is respectable for an old engine on
a single carb, I get 18-20.    Your bus  may not necessarily be burning
oil, if you see little splatters over the rear hatch outside, you are
blowing the oil out of seals somewhere into the cooling stream.  Oil
cooler?>  Rear crank seal?  This can be from bad seals or from excessive
crankcase pressure due to blowby (rings).  What's the engine compression
test say?   What do your plugs look like?  How black is the tailpipe
when you stick your hand in there?  How well jetted is the single carb
on the 2000?  I'd think it might even be lean.
BTW, 75 was fuel injected- you still have the ECU in the wall behind the
battery?
