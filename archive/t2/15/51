oh boy!?, I've had many VW's and have had mine now for 8 years so I know
it pretty well, and I would consider that a serious trip, but would
probably be able to make it without major problems, but
  you have never actually driven this VW right?  so you don't know the
normal sounds'' the not normal sounds that won't cause problems and the
serious shut it down NOW sounds.  
  your looking at, at least 35 hours of driving with no problems.  I
wouldn't even try to drive faster than 100kmph, slower if it is hot, (over
30C) you at least are doing it in the winter so that should help.

>check before I leave? The engine has been rebuilt within the last 2 years

how mechanically inclined are you, do you have a good complete tool kit?
are they throwing any VW parts in with it?
do you have an AIRS type help system?
Brisbane to Darwin puts you through some pretty "empty" territory too

I guess the first thing I would say is make sure your auto club insurance
is paid up and your cell/satellite phone is working and charged up

Brakes???
fuel lines??? (buy/bring a fire ext)

I personally would rent a truck and haul it home.  That way if you break
down it is SEP (someone elses problem).  I really would hate to see you
broken hearted by your new VW almost as soon as you get it.  

understand this is a 26year old vehicle that you know NOTHING about,
except what the person trying to get rid of it told you.

you may have no problems what so ever, or it could fail to stop at the
first traffic light.

as for what to take.

. all the manuals you can get your hands on especially Bentley
. all the tools you can carry
. all the spare parts you can lay hands on.
. TWO spare tires
. emergency gear to keep you alive for at least a week
. two good jack stands
. two good jacks (one a hydraulic floor jack)
. a 2 meter length of pipe.  big enough in diameter to go over your tool
handles.  Leverage!
. dist cap, rotor, two sets of points
. rabbits foot for rear view mirror, lucky charm in pocket

good luck
