Subject: long term storage

Hi list...
10 months ago I put the 70 westy up on jacks and carefully followed list 
advice for the long term storage proceedure. Other than a little advancement 
in the rust below the wind screen, things look great.
The best piece of advice was the desiccant - it took about 3 litres of 
moisture from the air in those months - water that might have seriously 
mildewed the interior - thanks!
Now, once again I turn to experts for advice on getting back on the road
Is there anything I shoud do before putting the battery back in and trying 
to start it up.
I had stabilized the gas, changed the oil put oil in the cylinders, and had 
the battery charged.
But I just know you will have invaluable advice that will add years to the 
life of my bus.
Thanks and as always,
Duane
70 Westy, Lesley Van Gogh
