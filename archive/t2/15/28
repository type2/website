Subject: Re: [T2] '74 wiring harness

If you want new wiring, why grab a junker harness that could have as many
flaws as your old one if you're willing to spend for new anyway?

You could spend the effort to compare the 72 and 74 wiring diagrams and find
the differences, adding a few cables here or there to the 72. They can't be
terribly different for those years, both carbed, both bays, etc...
