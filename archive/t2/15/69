A too tight belt will put excess load on the belt, the pullys and the
alt/gen bearings. If the belt is burning, the sides will get glossy. A
little too loose is prefered to a little too tight.

I watch the belt while reving the engine. If it is fluttering excessively
(more than 1/2") between the pullys, it's too loose. Remove one shim and
try again. If the slack is adjusted properly and it slips and screaches,
put on a new belt. Inspect the pulley halves. The surface the belt rides on
should be flat. If worn, replace them.
