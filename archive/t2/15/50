I'd take a few extra days and make some local trips not too far from a
prominent 
Brisbane WV mechanic.
If everything checks out just pack some food, water, Fosters in the ice
box (tall cans) , extra liter or so of petrol and a few extra liters of
engine oil. Best to get 20/50 or straight 40 wt.
Check to be sure your spare is good, get a cheater arm for your lug
wrench or check that you can get the wheel lugs off.
When you get ready to pass another car be certain that you've made an
appointment to do so.
Thats it, don't be paranoid.
AIRS in in Australia too, I think.
As for the type of engine, ask the guy that sold it to you.
