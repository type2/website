I have been a student of the wiring diagram from thom's  (fitzpatrick?)
link on the type2 tech notes. It's a brainbuster, but I'm trying to
basically see the diagram and the loom itself side by side in my mind. If
using the diagram, I recommend getting the translation table for the German
wire gauge (cm2 in cross sectional area) to American (AWG) to insure a
easier time replacing cables.

I like the idea of a homemade loom. No more too short lengths of wire,
change things if you want etc.  Also, who knows your bus better electrically
than you after such an ordeal, create your own electrical diagram. Pay me to
do it! Just kidding, sort of.

So no flame taken, none intended Bob, I know more about wiring than I do
about buses just yet, furthermore, I drive a 76 with 79 cal engine, so I
must digress to those of you who drive them.

Bill.
