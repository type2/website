Subject: '74 wiring harness

The main wiring harness in my project '74 Westy is in dire need of
replacement.  But the closest I can find in catalogs is for a '72.  Does
anyone have any experience in modifying the '72 harness?  Or are there any
other alternatives?  The bus has a non-FI 1.8L.

Thanks,
Darren.
