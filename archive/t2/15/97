the cut-out part of the piston should be positioned the same on both sides (mirror images of each other.  the piston can be rotated to 
accomplish this.  the position of the piston is maintained by a thin metal plate between the piston and pad.  the plate has two small 
punched out tabs that keep the piston from turning.  See the Bentley for the correct piston position.
