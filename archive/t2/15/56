Subject: Re: [T2] remanufactured brake parts

I don't have my Bentley here, but I think that the '71/'72 calipers are
smaller and the pads are thinner than the '73 and later.  If they gave you
the latter (fatter) pads and the earlier calipers that would explain why
they don't fit.  Also, do you have the piston retaining plates?  (See
Bentley)   Finally tracked down a set, after not having them for many years
(Thanks, Joe at BustedBus) and put them in last night.

Good news - no more squeal.  Bad news - no more squeal.  (That distinctive
squeal was our Early Warning System that told my wife that I had arrived at
her office to pick her up.)   8^)
