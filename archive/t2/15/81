Subject: Help fitting thermostat cable

Asking advice from those who have replaced the thermostat cable in an 
original type4 2000cc engine in a 1976 Westfalia.

My cable is gone and I have no diagram or picture to work from in any of my 
manuals.

My engine is out of the vehicle and is upside down on a work cart, recently 
having had the exhaust pipe studs in the head replaced. This makes the 
thermostat easy to work on, so I am trying to get it working again.

I have fitted the new cable onto the bellows and have run the cable to and 
around the pulley, and now must thread it through a horizontal piece of tin 
and out onto the top of the engine.

The piece of tin has two holes in it and I don't know which to use. One is 
oval, the other round. They are about a quarter inch apart. Both will take 
the cable to the top of the engine.

I think I should use the oval hole, because the cable will swing through an 
arc as it acts to move the flap lever. But I'm not sure of this.

My view is of the bottom of the engine, looking past the pulley. I see two 
possible openings: One is oval-shaped, and the other is round, larger than 
the oval, and has a slot in it. The cable can pass through either opening 
and come out the top of the engine, after which I must insert it into the 
clamping device on the flap control lever.
                               __
Poor attempt at diagram:     (__)  or   O-  [and the circle should be 
larger in diameter than the oval.]

After all that talk about thermostats this month, someone will know the 
answer. Thanks in advance.
