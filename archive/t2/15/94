In addition, German rubber isn't exactly the best available.  It is adequate, but it seems that the stuff that comes on American and 
Japanese cars is much more resistant to UV and ozone deterioration.  I think the important thing is the molding and formulation, not 
where the rubber was made.  We lean on guys like Ronnie to do our research for us so we don't get stung with the junk.
