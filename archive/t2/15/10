Browsing and searching are mutually exclusive. =^)

If you get into the MHonArc reflector (click "Type2", then click 
"Read"), you can read the most recent 1000 messages (in reverse 
chronological order) by continually clicking "Next Page". There should 
be about 50 iterations of this in the reflector. About a months' worth 
probably.
