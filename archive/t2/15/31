Brad,
I agree with Frank.  There are many other sources for bus parts than
FLAPS.  I tried getting a guy at the parts counter to understand what
an oil pickup screen was when my usual VW parts shop was closed...

When I need parts, I make it a practice to check www.bustedbus.com ,
www.aircooled.net , www.bus-boys.com , www.busdepot.com , and on occasion
www.gowesty.com .

You can also make sure to hit every VW swap meet in your area for parts.

Have fun,
