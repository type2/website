Subject: 1971 Campmobile accessories

The interior worktable (1971 Campmobile) which is attached to the 
refrigerator/sink, will not fully extend, instead running into the rear-facing 
passenger seat. What is going on? Could one or both be non-stock parts, 
refrigerator incorrectly installed, etc. ? I'm clueless. 
BTW- I'm also looking for original or repro curtains, the ugly beige, 
offwhite, yellow plaid type.
