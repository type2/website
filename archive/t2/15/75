Subject: RE: [T2] Brazilian cab gaskets

You would be amazed at how many of your so called German gaskets are
actually Brazil or Mexico (even India) repackaged or just called German. The
parts warehouses in Europe buy just as the ones here in the U S do, from all
over the world. Just because you get something from Germany doesn't mean
that's where they were made. A good example is I import 62 to 71 tail light
seals from Germany. The last order I got I was shocked that the seals sent
to me were the same ones another supplier of mine has made in INDIA, the
SAME EXACT SEAL. Needless to say I was very disappointed on this, but my
overseas supplier did say they would make it right. Another thing is that
there are many manufacturers in Brazil and Mexico, so one might make an
excellent seal where the other is pure crap. This is were you have to rely
on the vendor you chose to purchase from. I personally inspect all items I
sell as to not have quality issues and have even refused to sell the
inferior product. Check out my dollar box, you could seal almost a whole bus
up with crap rubber.

Ronnie   hope this information gives you a little insight
