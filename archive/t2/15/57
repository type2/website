Subject: Re: [T2] remanufactured brake parts

I had the same thing happen to me. I think I was able to 
get one pad wedged in, and when i tried to force the 
other one in, my effort was rewarded with a pad that was 
slightly thinner for an inch or so. The guy at the shop 
was cool and gave me a break on the correct pads (he 
admitted that he'd given me the wrong one. Come to think 
of it he also sold me the wrong rear brake shoes, and 
was the guy who said a 009 was just what i needed. I 
don't shop there anymore.
