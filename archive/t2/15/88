Subject: Back from Mexico with my Riviera -- Carb question...

Hi all, I successfully drove back from Juarez, Mexico in my "new to me" 1974
Riviera. After doing some minor tune-up/checking-up on the engine down in
Juarez, I journeyed back to Colorado Springs. The bus made it fine, but
started running pretty crappy up in the higher altitudes of New Mexico.
Anyway, despite one broken alt. belt, I made it back.

Now the questions begin, The engine is still the original AW code engine
that came stock with this car, but it has been converted from a dual-carb to
a single Weber carburetor. Is this a normal thing, what would be the
benefitor detriment of going from dual carbs to a single one...?

first in the series of many, many questions. thanks ahead

roger
