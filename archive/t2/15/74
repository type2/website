this may be a wiring problem. common power for the inst cluster. should
be a black wire I think going to the last fuse.

The knobs are held in by  nylon buttons on the shafts. Look at bentley. if
you get in there with a thin blade you can pop them out. then the knobs
and shafts slide out. they are still somewhat firm in there due to metal
clips that put pressure on them (dont lose these) .I dont replace the
buttons afterword because the knobs will stay in fine without them.
look for a black wire that jups to all of the lamps thadont light and
follow it down to the fuse panel.

good luck
