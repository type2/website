Ever since a disgruntled owner gave me a '73 bus a month ago, I've been 
reading the digest with great pleasure and enjoying the parade of expertise 
displayed.
I'm replacing all mechanical components as money allows and "Tulip" has been 
on the road for two weeks now.
Yesterday I installed all-new vacuum hoses and found Home Depot has a 
reinforced PVC hose that appears to work well. I used two sizes: the 1/2" ID 
for the main line running to the brake booster and 1/4" ID off a tee and 
going to the automatic transmission. I used a regular 5/8" thick-wall hose on 
the booster vent connection.  I spent about $8 for all hoses.
Hope this helps someone who might not want to spend the money at this point 
for the OEM hoses.
