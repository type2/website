I have a 75 Westy I looked up the m codes for,,

I was just wondering if some of the unknown ones have been figured out yet?

you can see photos at http://www.globalserve.net/~jrivers/fs-75westy.htm

It has a sink and a fridge, no stove, 
there was a swing out table and a over the shifter table
I don't know about the radio, it is PO installed

I was surprised that the KN port of Kanada isn't known?
