Whoa......there are a few discrepancies in your ''75'' Westy:

On your site you mentioned that it has a 12v fridge.
Yes, in one pic you can see the vent in the top of the rear lid. BUT the bus is
missing the control panel on the wall.
And then above you say it has the city water connection. The city water
connection only came on the deluxe model. Your ''75'' is not a deluxe, it does
not have the 2 burner stove. The sink unit is from a standard/pop top Westy.
On the data plate, it say P27. That means it is the correct color and interior,
sage green w/green plaid.
P27 also means it is a deluxe. [P21 is a standard Westy and P22 is a pop top
Westy]
Someone has cannibalized 2 Westies to make it!
In your last pic, you show a plate on the angle. I have 3 77 westies and a 79
Westy, [one of the 77's and the 79 are gone now] all with the swivel seat and
NONE of them have that plate there. In all the buses in the wrecking yards I
have looked at/ removed parts from [at least 100!] I have NEVER seen that plate
there. But the holes are there! Maybe a non-USA thing??
Seeing the BA 6 heater, the 63 ah battery, and the 70 amp alternator....this
tells me it is 100% Canadian with out even seeing the KN code. The 79 deluxe I
had was a Canadian bus, but it did not have the plate......
