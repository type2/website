Subject: more dizziness(re:another 009 question)

After reading all the 009 realted posts, I found myself 
wondering if I could graft the vaccum adv. unit and 
centrifugal mechanism from my stock dizzy onto the 009 I 
am running right now. Btw, I have never been impressed 
with how my bus runs since i put it in.
My stock dizzy had excessive freeplay in the shaft, can 
i replace the shaft and/or bearings with those from the 
009. Or are those parts available seperately?, I would 
hate to tear both dizzys apart and end up with 2 non-
functioning units
