Subject: Seals again

    I have Genuine VW/AUDI packaged outer scrapers and also inner scrapers.
My front door seals are imported from Germany and are made by the same
company that makes the rear hatch seals. I also have molded windshield seals
with or with the groove for the trim.
   I have not ventured into the later 68-79 type 2 bus market as
availability on a lot of products was questionable and the pre 68 market has
kept me quite busy. In the coming month's we will be expanding our product
lines to cover the 68-79 year range, this in both OE parts and used. I have
parted over 25 buses in the last few years working on building up a full
inventory of late bus used parts.
   The only problem that I will have is that I do not personally drive any
68 or later buses so I have no way to test products except by customer
feed-back. Now if it was pre 68 We (type2parts.com) have tested virtually
every product we sell over the last 4 years.
   Another new item I will have in the next few weeks are the front floor
mats for 1968-1972 type 2's of which I was involved having made.
