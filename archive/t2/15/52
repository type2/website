Subject: remanufactured brake parts

Howdy all.  I have a '71 Campmobile, and have been
changing the front brakes.  I had the one-bleeder
style calipers, which I traded for core on the
remanned two bleeder type that Advance said was it. 
Also, they gave me two of the same side, as any way I
turn them, the pistons are turned differently, i.e.
one side is up and one side is down.  I think they
just gave me two of the same side.  The real problem
lies in that the pads they gave me are too large to
fit between the interior of the caliper and the rotor.
 Yes, the pistons are in all the way, but the pad will
not even engage the piston, as it is stopped by the
caliper.  I contacted Advance about the problem, and
they said that one company listed one part number for
'71-79 for front pads, and that another company listed
a different part for '71-72 and for '73-79.  The '71
pads from the other company are on order to check if
they work any better.  My question to you, list, is 1.
 has anybody else encountered this, and 2.  What the
hell did you do?

thank you,

Blake
