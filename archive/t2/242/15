Subject: Re: Starter Troubles

I bought an '82 Vanagon on Sunday.  Asked the seller if he had ever 
had the hot start problem.  "No...?" he said.  This guy hadn't driven 
it much and then only around Minneapolis.

About a hundred miles back to Wisconsin we stopped for gas.  Guess 
what...the same old same old VW trick...no start.  I was on my back 
tapping the solenoid and trying to cross the terminals to get it to 
spin with no luck.  Asked my SO to get a small plastic bag full of 
ice from the station and put this on top of the solenoid (which I 
assure you was VERY hot).  15 minutes later we were on our way.

So tell us where to get this Bosch reman. SR17X?  I have used the 
Bosch relay along with a pushbutton switch that crosses the starter 
terminals directly.  These will work, but if you say I can be done 
with this nonsense once and for all I will pay the price!!!
