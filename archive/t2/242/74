Subject: oil leak main seal can i drive far?

so i want to go camping this weekend, my 71 (type1 eng.)bus has a leaking 
main seal. it seems to leak the most when i first turn it off. my question 
is can i drive it for 1 thousand miles this weekend without tearing up 
somthing else? the clutch? the pressure plate? both brand new. i would 
rather camp than pull the engine and replace the seal:)
