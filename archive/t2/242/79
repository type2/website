Subject: Dual circuit brake  safety?

Hi All,

Dual circuit brakes are designed to maintain pressure in half (two wheels) 
of the car if the other half of the system fails.

But how much pressure is maintained during one circuit failure?

I simulated a major failure (no pressure)in the front wheel circuit and 
measured the pressure, at the master cylinder, of the rear circuit.
(The only thing connected to the rear output of the master cylinder was the 
pressure gauge before and after simulated failure).

The pressure in the rear circuit fell from a normal of 3200 psi to 300 psi. 
The master cylinder vendor claims this is normal.

Any comments?

Chuck
