Hey Mark, tell us, who is the Troll???

Anyways,  My best success with hotels and motels has
been priceline.  AAA has not even come within any
reasonable amount for a hotel I wanted.  With
priceline, one chooses the city they want, even
chooses the neighbourhood, then chooses the level of
service.  2 star is Best western/comfort inn, 3 star
is Holiday inn, 3.5 stars is Sheraton, Radisson, you
get my drift,  I have stayed at the Radisson Inner
Harbour Baltimore for $40, really nice hotel, a Best
Western w/ a full breakfast buffet in Fairfax for $20,
many times at Homestead suites in the fairfax/reston
area for $25, and the best one of all....  I am
staying for three nights overlooking Niagra Falls, a
block from the falls for $35 a night at the Sheraton
Four Points!!

In the above, AAA couldn't touch the radisson for
under $115, and $89 for the Sheraton, go figure,

I am a member of AAA, and I have been towed about four
times each year since I have been a member, a great
service (I have old cars) the triptiks and travel
books and maps (even city maps) are more than worth
the price of admission alone.

Bus content; every time I have needed the Bus towed,
they have always sent out a flatbed to avoid damaging
the steering or towing on the tranny.
