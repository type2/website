     I dealt with a company called Broadway Title in Birmingham, AL.  They 
were excellent!  Their people are a little hard to get in touch with on the 
phone (They use an answering service), so I admit I was nervous, but it all 
went very well.  I used them to get a title for my 74 bus.  It cost me about 
$150, you will need an extra $50 because you live in NC so expect to pay 
$200 (not cheap, but not too bad considering the price you paid for the 
bus).  The process is legit, though only to the letter of the law probably, 
and not it's intent.  What they did for me was basically bought my bus (I 
had to fill out a notarized bill of sale to them, yes scary, but I kept the 
bus) then they sold it back to me through AL.  That gave me a bill of sale 
from them in a non-title state and a receipt from their own auto auction 
company, which is all MD requires to title the vehicle.  I don't know how 
they do it for somebody in NC but they handled me quickly and it all worked 
really smooth.  They do not offer a rush service for NC, but they do handle 
cars from there.
