Whoops, not necessarily for an 82. Check with any Bosch authorized parts=20
supplier for the correct Bosch item for your year. The SR17X fits earlier=20
models, though if you're air cooled, it may well be correct. I'm not at the=

shop and can't look it up.

Regardless, this condition is typically founded in a starter that has=20
served a loooong life, and putting it behind you with the least cost is=20
best done, in my opinion, by replacing the starter with the genuine article=

that lasted so long to begin with.

itself when on vacation and long drives at 100=B0. I just replaced it=20
immediately, and will not have to fuss with it again for many years.

If you are having difficulty in finding a supplier, let me know and I will=
=20
look it up and quote you.
