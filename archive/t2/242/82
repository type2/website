Hi y'all,

Just wondering if anyone has ever put in a 12V heater in their Van?
I have a 72 van as some of you know but I recently tore out the old =
heater boxes
around the mufflers. i didn't like the idea of having the hot air from =
the engine coming into the cab.
plus if any oil spills near those heater boxes you have a chance of =
breathin in the bad air.
so anyway thats why i'm wonderin about the option of a 12V =
heater......cause winters comin soon.
Darren , the Canadian guy.
