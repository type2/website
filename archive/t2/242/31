I had good luck with them.  My wife bought a "AAA plus" membership a month
before I nailed a mule deer with my dad's (non-VW) van just east of
Eureka, NV.  Nearest repair was in Ely, 75 miles away.  Driver came out
the next morning, drove 15 miles past the van to pick me up in Eureka,
went back, put the van on the flatbed.  While we were driving, he was on
the phone to the mechanic telling him what parts to get to make the van
drivable again.  Six hours later, we were on the road.  At $5 a mile for
towing, the charge would have been $375 for the tow alone.

My only objection to AAA is that they are basically an insurance company,
but the represent themselves as having a "constituancy" of their members
when they lobby legislation.  They tend to support legislation which
will bring them more revenue, not that which is good for the members.
