Subject: Bus must go. 78 Champagne westy. Best offer.

My need for an empty garage is now greater than my desire to get this bus on
the road. Sad, but true.

78 champagne edition westy, in good shape, but engine is out. Located in
southern Virginia. No rust-though on body, rear windows are out to fix
surface rust. Low-mile engine and tranny included. All interior bits present
and in good shape, except front seats have been re-covered.

First person who would like her can have her for a decent offer. Possible
trades considered (rebuilt 091/1 tranny desired). I'll have pics online
tomorrow for those who are interested.
