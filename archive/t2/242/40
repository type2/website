Yes. Swing axle VWs rear wheels travel in an arc around the CV joint.

When you set it back down friction from the wheels, being closer together
while hanging down, is keeping the wheels together. You don't even have to
drive it to straighten them. . . Just roll it a few yards.

On beetles (well on my dune buggy anyway), if the wheels are hanging free,
the CV boot can actually be pinched and punctured between the axle and the
frame.

A damaged CV boot is probably the source of the oil.
