1.8L engine installed with new: main bearings, cam bearings, NOS p & c,
rebuilt heads. no previous noises.

last winter the supposed confirmed and widely recognized T4 guru (let's
just call him "john") made a house call and gave confidence the cam and
crank were fine and usable. fast forward to this month. the engine turned
over and the T4 mechanic from the only reputable vw only shop in the county
came over to hear the first turnover. we looked at each other and he said
cam noises. but he said things may loosen up. rechecked valves and
everything was right on. i put 25 miles on it and stopped in at another vw
only shop on the way home. owner and lead mechanic agreed: cam noises. i
asked "john" to stop over again and he did. now with 50 miles on the
rebuild he said, guess what. cam noises. i have enormous certainty the cam
rivits were tight tight. before i go in an do surgery again, do folks on
the list have any comments as to whether there are other things to consider
besides the cam. it sounds like bong drums in there, and gets louder and
more consistent as the engine warms.     - steve
