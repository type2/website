Subject: brake pads

ok well there is a long story that lead up to me asking this question but i 
dont really feel like retelling it. so my question is.... I accidently drove 
around with the BRAKES depressed for about a mile. Not the E-brake but the 
brakes themselves (In case it makes a difference). Well now that i have the 
brake pedal unstuck i felt like i should check the brake pads for excessive 
wear. My question is is it neccesary?? and if so what should I look for on 
them that will tell me they are no longer good or whatever. well thats it. 
thanks


p.s. when i stoped the car and got out i could smell the brake pads burning. 
if that helps...:-/
