High all,
I recently got a parts bus ('74) with a type 4 motor, either an 1.8L or =
2.0L (probably bits from each looking at it). It runs as good as you'd =
expect a $100 bus to run (I drove it ~100km to my place OK). When I =
tried to turn the engine by hand to check the timing, set the valves etc =
it has a very tight spot, it 'feels' like the piston hitting a valve or =
something and I need the starter to get it past that point! Other than =
that it turn freely and runs OK. There's no loud knocking sound when =
it's running (other than the usual warn bearing sounds).
Any suggestions on what it could be? I do plan to re-build this motor, =
but want to know what to watch for.
