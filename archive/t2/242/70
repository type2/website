Subject: Engine types in a camper.

I'm just starting to look for a camper.  I really need something
with a big pop up, not like the smaller splitty pop ups I've seen.
I also want reliability and repairability.  I'm familiar with the
type I engines but not the type IV, I know even less about the
waterboxers in the Vanagons.  I like the Vanagon interiors better
I don't really like green or orange plaid!
The fact that they are newer isn't bad but the waterboxers scare me.  I
know the in '80-'83.5 they came with the IV.  
So I guess what I'm looking for are experiences with each type of
engine in a camper.  Also, if I get a water cooled engine, which really
does seem wrong, am I out of luck getting help from AIRS?

p.s. I'm joining the Vanagon list also, FWIW
