Thanks List!!!!!
This is a MUCH friendlier, more helpful list than I remember it being a few years back.  You all are great!  I requested information packets and forms from Broadway Title www.broadwaytitle.com and International Title Service http://www.its-titles.com.  I will check them out and let you all know how it works out.

Thanks Again,

Eric
