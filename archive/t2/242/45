Yes. This is also the correct starter for the Porsche 911/912. Same starter 
as well as the 928 EXCEPT the 928 rotates the opposite direction, so 
carries a different no. but the case and solenoid and guts are the same. A 
VERY robust starter, as would be expected of anything approved by Porsche.

I'm not sure. Don't have the book here at home to verify.

Yes.
