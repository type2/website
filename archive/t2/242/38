Subject: Can anyone help with a Vintage Q

Hello All,
I have posted this to the appropriate list, but I am impatient.

I jacked up the 66 last evening to check the reduction box oil level.
Noticed the wheels would tilt inward while up.  Didn't think much about it.

I just opened the garage, and noticed a very large puddle of oil smack dap
in the middle of the vehicle, and both wheels are tilting inward.

I found the oil, it seems to be leaking from a bad CV joint boot.  Doe this
need to be replaced?  Obviously, but I am considering a road trip this
weekend.

I am curious, because it didn't leak before I messed with it, nor did I add
any fluid.

What's up with these wheels?  Will they straighten up when I drive it?

Thanx in advance,

Frank
