Ok
for the 4700th time...  I just got a Great '74 transporter NO TITLE in NC. (for $50 Woohoo)  What do I do???  I keep hearing about Title service companies.  Has anyone ever dealt with one?  The "legit" process here requires an insurance bond and many, many days.  Please help me.

Thanks,
Eric and ZebraBus
