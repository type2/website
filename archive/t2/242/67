well one way is to use a screwdriver across the terminals at the starter,
what I have done is run a heavy wire from the soenoid to a switch in the
engine comp, then directly to battery, have it mounted to the top of the
engine comp near the battery.
  while I put it in for "bumping" the engine when working on it, but if
the ignition switch is on the engine can be started with it also.
