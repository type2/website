Subject: Re:Brake Reservoir

Ray,
    When we bought our '71 the fill reservoir, behind the driver's seat, was
cracked.  After washing it out, and letting it dry completely I repaired it.
I used a small soldering iron (about 15 or 20 watts) and used it to melt the
plastic back together.  I pushed the plastic around in a circular motion
almost like you would do with a welding tourch.  Then I dragged plastic from
the surrounding area over the crack by melting it and slowly pushing it with
the soldering iron.  That all done, I cut a small piece of fiberglass window
screeen, just a little smaller than the size of the entire side of the
reservoir, and glued that on using epoxy.
    That was in '99 and here we are years later without any problems.  I
know my description of the work isn't that good, but check the type2
archives as I think I explained it better to someone else some time ago.
