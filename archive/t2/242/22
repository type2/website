While I agree whole heartedly with Dr. Tim on this point, you can get it 
pretty close using your ear. Turn the screw until the engine is running 
lean, and begins to idle roughly. Then turn the screw back towards rich 
until the idle just smooths out and then about 1/4 turn more and you 
should be pretty close. This is what Probst recomends to do when you are 
lacking the gas tester to do it right. This got me 1/16 or so of a turn 
lean when I had it tested. Not bad for by ear. It will at least get you 
running well enough to get to the emissions testers.

I had to mess with my AFM fairly recently. For my writup on what I did 
search the archives for 'probst,AFM' and it is the first post to come up.

Hope this helps,
