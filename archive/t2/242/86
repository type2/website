Subject: RE: [T2] Dual circuit brake  safety?

I thought the brake circuits were dual diagonal meaning that the passenger
side front and driver side rear brake are on one circuit and the passenger
side rear and driver side front brake are on the other circuit. If you
simulated both front brakes leaking then you disabled both circuits.
