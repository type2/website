Great numbers Bob, I just want to remind everyone of a few points:

a) Just because a battery says 100 amp-hours on the front doesn't mean you 
will get that much out of it.

b) You should never drain an automotive battery all the way down.  They are 
designed for short, high-current loads like the engine starter, not 
2-day-long .7 amp loads.  For a typical automotive starting battery like 
99% of us use in our bus, draining it 50% with a light would be pushing 
it.  That's 21 hours by Bob's calculations.  At that point you are already 
shortening the lifespan of the battery.

My recommendation is still to NOT use the starting battery for something it 
was not designed for, and to therefore limit discharging to 25% or less of 
the battery's capacity.  12 hours at .7 amps is in that ballpark and if you 
are not, for whatever reason, able to fit an auxiliary battery, you can 
probably get away with it.
