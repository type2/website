Subject: knocking sound from wheel, CV Joint?

Have an intermittent knocking sound coming from the
left wheel of my 83 westy.  The knocking sound only
appears when on the gas in gear.  As soon as you let
off and coast (even in gear) the knocking sound goes
away.  I was able to eliminate the noise on my
roadtrip by pushing the transaxle arm toward the
tranny, and sometimes the knock would dissapear all on
its own.  What is the main offender here, and could it
just be a lack of lube in the joints or bearings and
could be fixed by getting a new rubber boot cover and
regreasing?  or do I need to replace the entire thing?
 Thanks

p.s. just took my 83 westy on her maiden voyage to
yellowstone, tetons, and rocky mountain national park.
 other than the knock she performed admirably, and the
camping was oh so cushy.  I've had her now for about a
month and i think I am hooked.  thanks for all the help
