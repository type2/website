Okay here is my expereince in TN next door to you.

If you don't have a title, they can have a police officer inspect you VIN 
numbers and they run checks to see if the vehicle comes up stolen someplace 
or has a lean against it.

They make you sign some paperwork that says you promise it isn't stolen and 
is legitimate. Also a notorized letter saying the same from the previous 
owner is always good.

By the way if you can get the previous owner to help you, you can get them 
to apply for a lost title in the state where it was last registered.

I have also heard of processes that involve titling the vehicle after it's 
storage fees exceeded a certain amount or a certain period of time.

The title services are legitimate and simply taking advantage of loopholes 
in certain states like Alabama to title the vehicle as a lost title vehicle 
in that state.
