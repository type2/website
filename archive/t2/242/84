Subject: oxygen sensor and tune up

after reading how to turn off the oxygen sensor light
I ran into a bunch of article from the list talking
about how to tune your mixture with the oxygen sensor
and how to install one.  I have an 83 aircooled and it
seems that it already has one.  do i need to get an
aftermarket oxygen meter to test the fuel mixture? if
not, do I just need a volt meter to test the voltage
of the oxygen sensor is .5?  Also, should I reset the
timing before or after I check the fuel mixture?  I am
particularly interested in the fuel mixture because I
live in Denver and want to have the optimal for the
altitude.  thanks a bunch

keep it positive
