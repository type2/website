Subject: 73 automatic to 4spd 

I have read e-mails about searchin the archives for previously learned
lesson.  How do you search the archive for problems encountered with
switchung from an auto trans to 4spd.  other than the obvious parts
differences does the body accomodate the shift tube and clutch cable
housing?
