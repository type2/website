Hey thanks for the plug Adam, yes we do still have some tapes from the
seminar, I have had to make more because of the demand.  Contact
<PINKNEWELL(-at-)aol.com> for prices.

I used to think the same thing about gas heaters, that they wouldn't stand
up to constant use, but have seen and used many that were the only source of
heat.  We never worry about the blowers in water cooled heaters wearing out,
same way with the blowers on the gas heaters, they will run a long time and
never need replacing.  I like the Eberspacher heater design, but I think the
Stewart Warner South Winds have much more durable parts and are easier to
get.

And the REALLY COOL (pun intended) part of a gas heater is the fact you can
put an RV thermostat on them and the bus will remain the same temp whether
the engine is running or not!!  Turn it on before going to work and get in a
toasty warm bus with the windows all defrosted and ice melted off!!  Great
for overnight camping too, set the thermostat for the temp you want (I don't
mean high/med/low, I mean the EXACT TEMP) and sleep warm and worry free, no
fumes or exposed flame, only warm air, dry air.  The gas heater works just
like your forced air furnace in your house, same principal.
