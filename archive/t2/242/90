Subject: RE: [T2] Dual circuit brake safety?

Steven,

My 77 bus has front and rear circuits but I must confess the measurements 
were taken on a 73 Datsun 610. It has a front/rear system  similar to my VW.


The master cylinder circuit under test was not connected to the rest of the 
system, only the gauge.

My point is that in a newly rebuilt master cylinder a single circuit brake 
failure leaves me with much less than normal system pressure in the 
non-failing circuit. And I am told by the vendor this is normal.

Chuck
