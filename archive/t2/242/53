tripple AAA coverage changes depending on the state. This includes number of
tows and even what vehicles are covered. A buddy and I were in Washington in
his one ton dodge when it broke down,  AAA WA didn't want to cover it as
they don't cover one tons on their passenger car plans, took some calling
but they had to as AAA Oregon does.
