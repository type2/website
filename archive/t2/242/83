Subject: Fw: CALL FOR HELP!!! Newark, NJ to Hannibal, MO

hey guys, my friend is going to pick up a vanagon he bought in NJ. he has
real good luck with getting cars and making it home with them even though
he hasnt driven them. anyway, he is flying in to newark airport and would
appreciate a ride to little ferry, 17 miles north. well, just read what
he wrote at our local club (although we do have some members around the
world, most are from here)

thanks guys, i will also tell him about the AIRS list... is there a way
to ask AIRS for a ride from the airport?

Alrighty then kids. I'm set for the road trip. I will be heading to 
Newark Airport on Thursday morning and picking up the Doormobile 
Vanagon dieselright hand drive and heading back west towards 
Hannibal, Mo., for the Busses Nowhere Near The Arch event. I will be 
passing thru NJ,Pa, Ohio, Indiana, and Missouri. If I have a problem 
along the way, is there anyone on my route that will be there for me? 
I am a decent guy and not a smelly street bum. Can you provide a safe 
driveway to park in for an overnight nap? 
If so, email me privatly at VWSottnik(-at-)aol.com

Also, is there anyone who can deliver me from Newark Airport to 
Little Ferry, NJ 17 miles north? Any leads as to how I can do that 
would be appreciated.I get in at 11:14 AM on American Airlines flight 
2950.

Pete
