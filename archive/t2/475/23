Subject: heater cables at dash

Darren, thank you so much.  However, what I really need is the front 
end at the dash, not the heater boxes.  Sorry.
I need to know what holds still the black plastic sheeths (?) so that 
only the metal inside cable moves when you move the lever.  I have a 
metal plate with 3 notches that the sheeths rest onto but nothing to hold 
them onto that plate.
Anyone else?  A photo would be awesome if anyone can.
