Not as bad as the liability on repair work you do for hire.  Be sure that
the buyer signs a bill of sale stating that the bus is being purchased in
an "as is" condition without liability to the seller.

This won't stop a slimy lawyer, as they can sue for anything, but it will
slow them down.

Personally, I wouldn't regale the buyer with stories about how you
singlehandedly rebuilt the entire brake and steering system.  That sort of
stuff can come back to bite you later on after they have an accident and
swear that a brake or steering failure caused it.
