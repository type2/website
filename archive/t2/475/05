I have worked as a mobile mechanic for 13 years, use a
73 bus with middle seat out, tools in the back, jack
and  jack stands in the middle. I charge $40.00 to
come out and $40.00 per hour. 15 minutes to fix a bad
set of points, 40.00+2.50 for points 42.50 total. I do
a lot of overhaules, pull up to their house, raise the
car pull the engine and take it home with me to work
on. I have personal liability insurance to cover the
bad guys, have never had to use it but there is always
that possibility. Phil
