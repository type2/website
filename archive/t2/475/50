Subject: sticky accelerator pedal

SO glad to have my bus running again. Really makes me appreciate it.

I know I've seen posts on this before, so I apologize for asking agin, but I 
don't know how to find them.
My gas pedal seems to be a sticking a bit. It only happens when it is almost 
all the way up. then it sticks. When you push it all the way down it returns 
about 3/4 of the way fine.
THe bus has been sitting a couple weeks so I don't know if that has anything 
to do with it.

Thanks,
Kyle
