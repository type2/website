Subject: RE: [T2] BA6 and stock heater

From what I have read, the BA6 has a flap that blocks the air from the
rear when the BA6 is running. It has an extra fan that pushes air
through. Once the stock heat starts to blow, this flap is pushed aside
and the stock fan system helps push air through the BA6. So in short,
your stock heat should work fine with the BA6 in place, although you may
have to be moving to feel any air flowing through it. I think the stock
fan in the engine compartment may not be enough to move the flap.

This is just what I "think" happens. I have not actually seen one
working to know for sure.
