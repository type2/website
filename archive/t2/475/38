Subject: TV riders

I have a TV but no VCR. I've gotten the full range
of comments on it. I never try and justify to the
nay sayers and just smile at the people who think it
is cool to see a TV in sucha "old" vehicle.
  I have used it while waiting for kids after school
when they were younger. When my son got older I would
take him and a friend of his.. load the canoe on top
and set them loose on a small lake in the area to fish
and poke around on their own. I would watch the
baseball game or read. It was a treat for them to be
on
their own. Andy, by this time had his canoe merit
badge plus the countless hours he spent in it with me.
 When I was that age I was playing on Lake Huron in a
14' alum. boat or canoe so it was nice to let them
"be out on their own" for a bit.
  Technology can be your slave our you can be it's
slave.. it's up to you. If you hate TV's thats fine
with me.. I would ask the same consideration in
return. Let me enjoy what I enjoy and I will do the
same for you. (I wont force you to watch mine)
  An John.. I did get a kick out of all that child
raising advice I got from people without kids. So
clueless. :-) How things change when they do have
kids!
  As for bus content... is there anyone on the list in
Toronto that has modified their heat system with a
bilge blower fan? If so would you be willing to help
someone do theirs? Not for me for someone else ( I R
in Seattle). Contact me off list and I'll pass the
info
along to them. 
TIA
