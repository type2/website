The engine hatches of the modelyears 1972 and 1975 are
the same. From modelyear 1977 until 1979 a different
hatch was used. The difference is in the hinges. The
1972-1976 hinges are fixed to the body with two screws
each. The 1977-1979 hinges are smaller and fixed with
only one screw each.

So if in doubt compare the hinges.
