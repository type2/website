Well, I was the guy that first responded with the comments on the
TV.  I meant it to provoke debate, but the debate got large pretty
quick.  The way I handled that problem was to simply stop posting on
the thread.  I mailed you privately on Wednesday, ferinstance.

Agreed.

I think there is an underlying assumption here that having kids should
not change one's life-style at all - that if one drove all day to get
to a campout without kids, then one should still be able to drive all
day to the campout _with_ kids, by doing whatever it takes to keep
the kids happy during the drive.  I disagree with this premise.

There are at least two more options that I can think of.  3) Don't go
on the trip.  4) Go on shorter trips.

It doesn't work that way.  The thread doesn't get killed after you have
the last word.

Good deal!  Were either of the Library links helpful, or did you find
another write-up that was better?
