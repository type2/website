Subject: Trade 79 parts bus with title

Hey Y'all.
I know this is a strange post, but I assure you it is
not an attempt at dishonesty. I have a 79 parts bus
(sunroof passenger bus) with title in my name and VIN
tag that I will never use.  I have a 67 bus I am
restoring with no title (I do have a bill of sale from
P.O.) So I'd like to trade you my old 78 parts bus
with a title (in my name!) for a title and VIN tag
from your old 64-67 parts bus. I only want a title and
VIN tag from your bus, you can either have my entire
bus, including its title and VIN, or just the title
and VIN.  Of course, if you want to include your whole
bus in the trade, I'll take it. I've got my flame suit
on, so if anyone wants to harass about how you think
this is inappropriate, go for it!!
