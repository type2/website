Tom,

Is it a one or more wire o2 sensor.
You know how these things work, right?  They are supposed to flucuate 
rapidly back and forth between lean and rich when at running rpm and 
unless you have a heated one, they have to get hot before they work.

If it is a one wire, then you have to have a good ground where it is 
installed.

I don't think that you are going to get much action out of the o2
sensor with the CO screw at idle.

Cheers, dave
