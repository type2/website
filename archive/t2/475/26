Subject: Re: [T2] Trade 79 parts bus with title

I had a 1958 Isetta 600 for several months.  When I decided that I wanted to
sell it to fund my Subaru Sambar Van Passion, I needed the title.

It was easy.  I downloaded the affadavit off of the va dmv website,
(dmvnow.com) signed it in front of a notary, sent it with sales tax ($35)
title fee ($10) and administrative fee ($30).

Waited 40 days, because they had to do a vin search etc, and I got a legal
title.

My isetta then became so much more valuable for just $75!!

If your state does not allow a similar process, then there are several title
companies in Alabama that will do it for $200-$240.

By all means, don't break the law!!

"Nothing in the world is more dangerous than a sincere ignorance and
conscientious stupidity."
Martin Luther King, Jr.

"The dominion granted to man by the Creator is not an absolute power, nor
can one speak of a freedom to 'use and misuse', or to dispose of things as
one pleases. The limitation imposed from the beginning by the Creator
himself.... shows clearly enough that when it comes to the natural world, we
are subject to not only biological laws, but also to moral ones, which
cannot be violated with impunity."
Pope John Paul II, The Social Concerns of the Church, 1987

Hey Y'all.
I know this is a strange post, but I assure you it is
not an attempt at dishonesty. I have a 79 parts bus
(sunroof passenger bus) with title in my name and VIN
tag that I will never use.  I have a 67 bus I am
restoring with no title (I do have a bill of sale from
P.O.) So I'd like to trade you my old 78 parts bus
with a title (in my name!) for a title and VIN tag
from your old 64-67 parts bus. I only want a title and
VIN tag from your bus, you can either have my entire
bus, including its title and VIN, or just the title
and VIN.  Of course, if you want to include your whole
bus in the trade, I'll take it. I've got my flame suit
on, so if anyone wants to harass about how you think
this is inappropriate, go for it!!

Hey John why don't you just sell the bus for 200.00 and use that money to
get a title through one of those title search places?
