Hiya Ian,

I have two 1970 VW vehicles, a Bus and a Bug.  In both the little square 
headed set screw for the hockey stick was torqued in so tight it took a real 
struggle (I actually broke a new 8 mm end wrench on one of them) to get them out.  
On top of that, both screws had a hole through which was a safety wire.  That 
safety wire was then wrapped around the hockey stick/coupler assembly.  No way 
was that screw coming out.

Mike
