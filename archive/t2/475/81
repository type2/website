Subject: Re: [T2] Report...trip to germany

No, I didn't discover any secret parts caches, but did see a few
buses.  On a train trip to a town about an hour outside of Frankfurt,
I did see a bus picture #1 here...

This bus was parked at the train station, I didn't try
to translate the lettering...maybe someone else?

der Frosch => the frog

i would guess that it has to do with the color of the bus. for additional
good german to englisch translations and dictionary look ups point your
