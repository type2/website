I forgot to comment on sleeping sideways in the rear bedseat when not
unfolded- this is less safe than sleeping in the rear with a barrier to
keep you from smashing into the hard cabinet or into the front seats. 
I've tried to sleep on the full 74 bedseat we put into the 78 camper
( http://www.geocities.com/mike_benthin - if down, too many hits and
email me for pics)- but it is awkward to use the stock belt and I make
sure any passenger doing this has their head on the noncabinet side or
rig up the tarp I discussed to prevent flying off the seat.
