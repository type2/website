There are basically three maintenance items:

- take the slack out the accelerator cable when you tighten the nut that holds it to the throttle body.

- there's not much to the pedal other than the hinge,the pin and the spring under it. It's easy to drive the pin out and take a look down there. Clean up that are and the part and use a little grease on the pin when you reassemble.

- where the main spring is on the throttle body, it's probably pretty gummy and it could use a very good clean.

When all those items are in good shape and the engine is in tune with good compression the bus feels quick. I'm not sure when the cable needs lubrication.
