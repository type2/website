Subject: Late model heat blower on early bay

Anyone ever wired up one of those 72& up heater
blowers to their early bay window engine to help with
heating?  I have a spare and was considering putting
it on my 71 and hooking it up to the heat exchangers
and plug the holes in the fan shroud where the hoses
normally attach.
If you've done it, How did it work for you?
