There is a small metal clip that wraps around the cables. You should see a
small hole on the right side of that metal plate. One end of this metal
clip fits into this hole to anchor it and other end of the metal clip is
bent so it snaps onto the left hand side of the metal plate after wrapping
around the cables on the front of the plate.
