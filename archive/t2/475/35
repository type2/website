Hi James.

Oh boy. I have a feeling this is going to be worse than the TV thread. 
Here's my $.02.

Not any more. On the overnighter I drove down to "John Brown's Buses" 
in 2002 we travelled with the bed down and my kids slept while I drove. 
In retrospect this was not a good idea: I discovered there are a LOT of 
deer on the PA highways at night in the fall.  This year I took an 
extra day off work and drove down during daylight. Safer in both 
respects.

If my kids *ask* for something out of the cooler, I will let them 
remove a belt to get it when I feel road conditions are safe. As soon 
as they return to their seat I start listening to hear the belt 
click.If I don't hear it soon, I demand they do it up. Being without a 
seat belt is not acceptable unless pre-authorized.

It's against the law in Ontario. They take points off your license and 
fine you $300 per belt.  The points will be certain to raise your 
insurance rates. That said, Ontario roads have two things you don't see 
too often in saskatchewan: hills and curves.

I'd suggest you either travel in daylight or get them used to sleeping 
with the belt on.

Happy trails,
