In the bargain Closeout Bin of Sears I found a roll of that stainless
safety wire for $3.00 (was almost $9)....could not believe how you could
kink it forever and it would not break!

 The hole is for placing a safety wire so it cannot come
 loose. I use stainless safety wire like used all over aircraft. Stock
 design installed stock works perfectly every time all the time.
