Indeed, I have seen such out of print books on ebay. I would also check 
http://powells.com. They have a whole city block with 3 layers of new and 
used books and a great place to find such as old references. Find something 
published in say 1990 and most Vanagon and Type2 times will be shown going 
back 15 years. Get a 1980 edition and it should go back to mid 60's and all 
the carbureted era cars. Mitchell, Motors, Chilton all publish them. Flat 
rate books. Go get them and learn to read and interpret them properly for 
rule of thumb time/values.
