Subject: Cache Valley Utah Listies??

Greetings,

Besides attempting to get to know some local bus folks I am trying to find 
some sort of shop space/garage to rent in order to finish my 78 Westfalia 
restoration Project. I live in Logan.  P-mail me if you live in Cache Valley 
even if you don't know of any place as it would be nice to meet up. I need 
about 2 months worth of space (at least I hope).

Thanks,
Brandt
