It's one-wire, and I understand completely how they work.  I had driven
around for 20 minutes or so before pulling back into the driveway to begin
the test and all the fluctuations were on the "lean" side, .3 volts and
below.

I grounded it right at the sensor itself, which should be as good as it
gets.

No, if everything is functioning properly you should be able to run it from
dead lean to over-rich using to CO screw at idle.  It's the only "official"
adjustment in the whole system.
