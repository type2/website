Whoops!

Sorry guys, another difference between regular and Champagne edition

http://www.72camper.com/champagn.htm

Rims on the Champagne edition were painted the top color(Fox Red).
Note that the westy champagne edition look to be either white or 
silver...can't quite decide.


Interesting!

Cheers, dave
