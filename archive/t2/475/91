 you how I fixed mine.  When we bought our 71 the fill reservoir had a
 crack in it.  I couldn't find a new or used one anyplace at the time I
 needed it so I decided to repair what I had.  First thing to do is
 remove  and thoroughly clean the reservoir inside and out.  Make the
 last of the cleaning a rinse with plain water and then let it dry
 totally.  Then I used a hot soldering iron with a brand new tip to
 melt the plastic around the crack and seal it up.  I just held the tip
 to the plastic and slowly swirled it over the crack to move the
 plastic around.  It was kind of like welding the plastic.  It's 1
 month shy of 4 years since I did that, and it still holds without a
 leak.

I guess you have not seen a 68-only upper reservoir. They are as thin as tissue paper
and as fragile a snowflake. Once they start to self-destruct, you can kiss them goodbye.

I would replace the upper, lower, and tube with one from a 69 or 70. 68 to 70 masters are the only ones that
are 100mm from center to center, so these are the only years that will work. The
69-70 upper reservoirs were round and not much more substantial than a 68.
Once you replace the metal 68-only tube, you could then use a 71 and up square upper reservoir.
These are stronger.
I have not seen a good used 68 upper in about 3 years.
