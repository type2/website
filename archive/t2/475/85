The hatch is the same, the hinges are different,, but the interchange in
this way.........

The late hinge hatch with the bent wire and one mounting screw will fit
the early body with 2 screw holes.. without modification

the other way around,, you would have to modify something,, you pick ,,,
the body indentation needs to be wider, another hole added to the body,
the hinge on the lid cut in half? I dunno if that is possible

Hope that helps
