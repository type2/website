> The connection between the rod (I believe it's called the hockey stick?) and
 the transmission under the bus at the FRONT of the Transmission ... is held
 together by one small screw.  The screw goes through a rubber and metal
 U-shaped coupling and into a *shallow* indentation in the rod coming out of
 the tranmission (called the nose cone?).  Well, if you still follow me, this
 screw disappeared, and thus I could not shift.


Sounds like all you need is a new shifter coupling. Yes, they are cheesy but they usually stay together when
you have all the pieces.

The long center screw is self-tapping and it kinda locks into the female part. Seems to be designed as a
use-it-once and then replace it. If you take it apart and use it over, the threads don't hold as tight.
