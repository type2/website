Hmmm, can't find it in the dictionary and I am not
that good at German...sorry. The bus didn't exactly
come out of the Frankfurt region. The licenceplate
starts with 'HH' which stands for Hamburg.

Nice option! Perhaps a conversion for a sight-seeing
bus or something. Looking at the seals it looks like
it was done after it came from the factory. But it
looks professional, may be a special bodywork company
made it.

Yes, that's what I heard as well. It is the
environmental regulations they have in Germany since a
few years. It is the end of the old village junkyards.
I am affraid we will get this over here in The
Netherlands as well.

Finding a T2 on a junkyard in the Netherlands is kind
of hard these days. Most of the junkyard vehicles were
exported to Congo (former Zaore). Every now and then
Africans who see me driving in my 1971 panelvan ask me
if it is for sale for export.
