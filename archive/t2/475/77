Subject: bus for sale?? 69 many extra parts

If i can't fix the tranny i might have to unload this faithful vessel.   i bought it from the original owners about 1.5 yrs ago. I replaced the original single port 1600 which threw a rod with a dual port 1600 with low miles and good compression 130 all around. the engine came out of my friends 71 super beetle. It ran strong and smooth and up to 70 mph easily till I lost 2nd gear  and then 3rd.  I t has brand new exhaust, new brakes front and back and good tires with much life. The tranny is shot. the body is ok no dents some rust but nothing major. It's been in california since 1971 or so. it's green with a white top. all the doors open and close well even the slider and the freaking heater works it's been well taken care of. I'd like to get 700 but will entertain any reasonable offer. If you have a good line on a transmission or an old bus with nothing but one this could be the bus for you. I will throw in the old single port engine for parts along with many extra parts. I'm in the
 San Francisco Bay Area  Berkeley to be exact.
