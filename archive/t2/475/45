I've seen several graphs of the voltage vs. AFR for single wire O2 sensors in books and over and over it seems to indicate that between .3 and .8 volts the AFR is near the stoichiometric point. When the engine starts to go very lean ( > 0.3) the voltage changes quickly and the sensor loses it's accuracy.

When everything is working correctly otherwise large adjustments of the screw can have little effect on the CO.
