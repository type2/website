Subject: Re: '71 Brake Warning Light

Hi follow up on the brake warning light - it is still on, except when
depressing the brake pedal.

Decided to test each switch individually by pulling the connection to
the other, one at a time. Both switches successfully activate the
brake lights (rear brake lights), however disconnecting each switch
individually does not make the brake warning light go off.

I will re-bleed everything again in the morning.

Please, if you've seen this before let me know what you think.

FYI, I didn't bench bleed the brake MC but used Bartnick's technique
which I found in the archives:

Thanks
