	I too got v good service from 6-ply-rated  Yokohama light truck tyres.
	One reason why we end up at cross purposes is that tyres' 
lifetimes differ so greatly, even for what looks like a given make & 
model.  Behind that variation lurks that point I mentioned  -  if 
kept in a cool place they harden and gain longevity (at the price of 
grip).  This 'cool storage' needn't be under your house before 
they're installed  -  it can be many years ON the vehicle, if you're 
doing only a small annual mileage.
