unfortunatley DON there isnt anyone close enough to turn wrenches with and the only one i know i like turning wrenches with hurt his back and couldnt make it today....
  i stuggled all day yesterday to get this right and nothing.....
   
  all day today and nothing.... tomorrow makes three weeks now i have been dealing with this on my DAILY DRIVER~!~
   
  i have looked at the pushrod and looked at the pushrod and looked at the pushrod but dont get it.... i am afraid to twist that thing and end up in a worse mess  than what i am already in .....with somehting that was suppose to be simple....
   
  i just called advance and they have a vaccum bleeder there for 44 bucks and some change for rent and thats for 45 days and if i give it back within the 45 days they give back the 44 and some change.... so sounds like a good deal....
   
  wife just called and is on her way there now .... course her sister totiing her cause now the wifes car is messed up also...
   
  i want to thank everyone for there patience and help...
   
  you know i did everything i was suppose to do as written in the bentley through 1st and 2nd and now third master cylinder but i just cant seem to have any luck.... 
  i have did the same routine over and over now bleeding brakes and never have i ever had this type of trouble.......  
   
  wish me luck with the vaccum bleeder.....lets hope its in good working order when i get it to use...
   
  peace

  Chai,

Is there anybody on the list near you?

This sounds like one of those times that just having a second person
with you will make a huge difference.
