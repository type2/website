While my 78 Westy is undergoing a major restoration at present, a few
years ago I started modding it for hf.

I had a local Porsche shop fabricate an adapter, of my own design, to
mate one of Shakespeare Military's Humvee brackets.  This in turn
mounts their 16' m120 hf antenna system, which is connected to an
IC-706MkIIg via a SG-231 coupler. (I have the complete 32' ground
mounted vertical system and use it to good effect with my ARES/RACES
group.)  I upgraded the auxiliary battery to an Exide deep
cycle/starting hybrid design and saw no trouble with voltage over
several hours of 100w operations.

Using this setup, I even worked 160m at a Field Day site 2 years ago!
Next on the Christmas list is Shakespeare's NVIS adapter :-)

Sadly, my Exide battery got toasted when I left the refrigerator on
overnight last year.  So add to my shopping list a low-voltage
disconnect and HD charging relay; that little Bosch 40A unit toasts real
quick when connected to a dead battery!
