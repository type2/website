I have mentioned this to you a few times now but you
have not referred to it at all: Are you getting full
RETURN of the stroke - meaning, do you have SLACK or
some space or a gap - however you want to say it -
when the pedal is at rest - up - not pushed down -
however you want to say it! You can't get fluid into
the chamber if the ports don't get uncovered on the
return stroke.

Now the "REGULATOR" - It's a device to lessen front
end dive and rear wheel skidding. You said you got
fluid out the rear bleeders before, so this is not a
problem. All it is, is an inertia valve. There is a
large heavy ball that sits on a perch normally but
when the brakes are applied hard, it rolls forward
partially blocking the port to the rear brake circuit.

If you do open it up, have some VERY THIN gasket
material ready to hand-cut and reassemble with. Your
last phase of cleaning should be with clean fluid to
flush away whatever solvents you used in initial
cleaning.

I know several people have told you about flexible
lines - how the hoses decay on the inside and
sometimes develop a "flap" that acts like a valve -
when there is a movement of fluid, it causes the flap
to block the inside of the hose. I don't remember if
you replaced your hoses, but just thought I'd bring
that up.

Once again - is there slack in that pushrod up front?
There NEEDS TO BE! -BaH
