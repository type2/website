Is that running or not running?

A normal battery will read about 12V sitting, and near 14V wihen 
running.....

I would.....

I would certainly do three things before getting a new battery.

1) Remove the cables and clean the terminals GOOD
2) Inspect the cables where the ends are attached, if there is any sign of 
rust or corrosion, take the ends off (cut if you have to) and repalce the 
ends with new ones over nice shiny wire....
3) remove the battery, charge it and check again

>would it cause any of the FI components to not work?

Not that they wont work, but the FI needs a constant voltage to keep the 
injectors happy (and other components, I would find the root of the problem.

Enjoy!
