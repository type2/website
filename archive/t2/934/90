Subject: '71 Brake Warning Light

Hi

Replaced my master cylinder today because I was having a problem with
the front brakes dragging. Also replaced the two switches while I was
at it. Installation went well, no major issues. While bleeding the
entire system I decided to give the Bentley procedure for testing the
brake warning light a try. So with the left rear bleeder screw open I
turned the engine on and pressed the brake pedal. Brake warning light
did not go on while I was depressing the pedal, but instead activated
upon releasing the pedal. I turned the engine off, finished bleeding
the brakes and wrapped up the project.

Well here's the thing, I just went out for a test drive and now the
brake warning light is on continuously unless I am braking. What have
I done, and what is the solution?

She's a '71, so that means the brake warning light is the "push to
test" variety.

Thanks in advanced for any suggestions.

Brakes work well and no front brake drag.

I'd really like to get this fixed before driving over the river and
through the woods for thanksgiving tomorrow.

peace
