Or a vacuum pump.  I had to use an improvised vacuum setup (using the 
vacuum side of a mattress pump) to bleed some motorcycle brakes because 
we couldn't get it to bleed a dry system.  You can get vacuum pumps from 
your FLAPS in the brake section.  I believe it comes as a kit w/ the 
standard brake bleeding setup.
