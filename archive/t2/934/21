Okay - if you don't know if your brake pushrod from
the pedal to the master cylinder is adjusted properly
with a little bit of slack in it, Nobody can tell if
your MC piston is returning far enough to let fluid
INTO the cylinder. If the rod is too long, the piston
keeps the port covered and fluid can't get into the
cylinder. All that you have said indicates to me that
this is the problem and that is why I keep emphasizing
it. Sure there may be some other problem, but if you
don't check the pushrod adjustment you might as well
change lightbulbs and hope it helps the brakes!

That "regulator" is a proportioning valve by title and
ten years ago they were available still from VW for
$650 each! -BaH giving up!
