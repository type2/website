Subject: Abandoned Bus on PA Tpk.

Saw an abandoned hard top westy painted green with the Phila. Eagles logo on 
the side on the PA turnpike yesterday, roughly 10 miles west of Valley 
Forge.  It was on the west bound side and I was heading east and couldn't 
stop.  Anyone on the list?  If so and you need help, drop me a pmail.

Matt
