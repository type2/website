Subject: Broken Library Links

Hi,

Found a few broken links in the library on type2.com:

Brake Section:

Convert to Self-Adjusting Brakes by Karl von Salzen
http://type2.com/library/brakes/selfadjust.html

Suspension section:
Do-It-Yourself Alignment  by Calvin Sanders
http://www.vtr.org/maintain/diy-alignment.html

Total Wheel Alignment  by Craig Nangle
http://www.abrn.com/archives/0897tech.htm

There are probably more, these are just a few I came across casually.
