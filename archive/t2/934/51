Subject: Re: [T2] Nominal battery voltage ... Resoloution

Thank you to everyone offering help on this. Given a variety of  
factors (especially the weather and the need to be on the road this  
AM), I replaced the battery. Must have had a bad cell for a long time  
- the starter sounds like it has some real zing.

The original problem I was trying to resolve was hard starting on  
cold mornings. Pretty much had gotten to the point of trying to  
figure out if the Cold Start Valve or Thermo-Time Switch was non- 
functional. Tested the connector to the CSV and saw a good ground and  
signal path back to the Double Relay. While cranking the starter,  
there was no voltage across the leads on the CSV connector. Very odd;  
re-installed the recently replaced DR (different issue), but same  
result no voltage getting to the CSV. The engine does eventually  
start and runs normally, so this is puzzling. Anyway it was at the  
point of not seeing volts at the CSV that I checked the battery  
voltage - 10.6, etc.

Seems the conclusion is a low battery volts can result in the double  
relay not passing voltage to the CSV.
