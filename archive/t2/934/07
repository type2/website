 Found a few broken links in the library on type2.com:

 Brake Section:

 Convert to Self-Adjusting Brakes by Karl von Salzen
http://type2.com/library/brakes/selfadjust.html

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Strange, I went to www.type2.com and clicked on library, scrolled down to Karl von Salzen and clicked on the
1st link, convert to self-adjusting brakes and it opened right up.
http://www.type2.com/library/brakes/selfadjust.htm

Only difference between your dead link and mine is the www........
