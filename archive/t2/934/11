  Hi,

My bus is an earlier model than yours ('71), but there's a regulator between
the master cylinder and the rear wheels (it's located under the bus not far
behind the master cylinder). I seem to remember reading somebody's account of
servicing it and it was very "gummed up". Perhaps that is your
problem...dunno...

                                                                Better start thinking about sealing up those windows and leaky doors....
  Winter months are on there way,dont forget to break out the heater and Lets Go CamPing~!
