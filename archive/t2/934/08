Ahh, there's the article.

Thanks for the working link.

To get to the broken one:
Open up type2.com
Click the Library Link
Scroll down and click the "Brakes" Link, Brakes page opens
Scroll down to "Convert to Self-Adjusting Brakes by Karl von Salzen"
Note 404 error.

The critical difference is that this link points to "selfadjust.html"
while it should point to "selfadjust.htm". The extra "l" is the link
breaker.

Back to bus content (although it is Friday) - self-adjusting rear
brakes seems like a great upgrade. With the proper availability one
might even be able to make it happen with new components. If I'm
reading it right you'd need 2 backing plates, 2 wheel cylinders, 4
shoes, and all the springs etc, but not new drums because you could
use the bay drum with the vanagon backing plate?
