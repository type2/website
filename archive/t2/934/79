I did a special event station at BBB a few years back.  Call sign W7V.
Lots of contacts ranging from Iceland to Japan with 100W on 20m and 40m
and a wire antenna at about 30 feet.

If you decide to do this, make sure you have several operators to man the
station or else you won't get to enjoy the bus event at all.
