  Sorta Type2 related. I'm smoking the turkey in my gas smoker. On the table next to it is sitting POR-15 prep products. Metal Ready and I don't remember the name of the other one. And a couple of oven mitts and a propane grill lighter. It's running along at 300F. I go to the store, come back, and the table is on fire. What would have ignited first? Is the POR-15 stuff that flamable?? Probably it was the lighter which was right underneath the cloth mitts. But it was a nice fire. Just glad it didn't interfere with the great looking and smelling turkey that we'll enjoy tomorrow. But that POR-15 stuff is not cheap! I'm just glad I didn't have the $30 POR-15 can sitting there. It was inside the house. And I'm glad the house is brick. Whew...KR
