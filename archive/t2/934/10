Hi,

My bus is an earlier model than yours ('71), but there's a regulator between
the master cylinder and the rear wheels (it's located under the bus not far
behind the master cylinder).  I seem to remember reading somebody's account of
servicing it and it was very "gummed up".  Perhaps that is your
problem...dunno...

Bruce.
