"Jaever" have one of those days, boy?  I had lost some of the "fixins" for
putting the Westy together, so went down island to get some.  WhoHoo!  On my
way home, it is foggy and rainy, and I am so happy to have acquired parts, I
am not paying attention!  A big white Chev van rips past me, then his brake
lights come on, and there is a RCMP pointing "us" to the shoulder.  I pull
over, and after the van has received his ticket, and moved on, the officer,
comes to my window and says, "hi how are you doing?"  I say fine, and I was
not speeding!  He syas I know that!  I feel relieved and plan to move
away,...but he says, "can I see your license and registration?"  I show!  He
says "good", but I want to do a walk around and "see" your vehicle.  "Put your
lights on please."  I say they are on.  He says they are not working!  Try
your horn please, nothing!  And I also notice your left front tire is totally
unsafe!  He gives me a 30 day inspection notice, and if I don't have it done
and checked by "them", they will pull my plates!  The he says " and thank you
for stopping!!!!"  So as my wife states, you should have fixed "those things"
earlier, the Vw parts, are once again "on the shelf", while the rest of this
stuff transpires!  Aren't Fridays Great!!
Ps  Fixed 1/3 of the problem, and have installed VW parts!
