Subject: junkyard find and engine price

hey,

out driving today and stumbled across a salvage yard.  saw a two tone
brown bus.  stopped in later after finishing some business and found
the bus still had a complete engine and manual transmission.  if i
wanted to buy this from the pick and pull type yard what is a
reasonble price for an engine and transmission about which i know
nothing?  i'm in the stl area as is the afore mentioned bus.  the bus
itself is actually in pretty good condition also.  lots of good usable
parts inside.  good mirrors.  door vents.  arm rests.  etc.

thanks,

jeremiah
