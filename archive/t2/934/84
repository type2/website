Well, I didn't realize our new emissions testing law requires you to be re-tested every year.  But I passed again!  1976 Kombi (says that on their report), 1.7L, single weber, 009.  The report:

HC: 61 PPM  Limit: 500  Pass!
CO:  3.44 %  Limit:  5.0  Pass!
CO2:  5.58%  doesn't say what the limit is on that

Nice black lady that did the test looked worried when I pulled in.  When she got the report she said, "man, you done great!"  Last year the guy told me I ought to go frame it.  

Would I pass in Cali?  
Now I'm afraid to mess with upgrades.  And she runs near-perfect.  Stoked...KR
