Yet another reason I won't be moving there anytime soon.  (Another is named Pelosi.)  But I must admit, even with the immoderate degeneracy, San Francisco is one of the most beautiful cities in the world.  And I've seen a bunch of them.  Nice place to visit, wouldn't wanna...yeah, like New Orleans.  Before the flood. Ah, the stories I can tell around the campfire on that one.   

"Cal emissions refugee"  ROFL!  I passed the proctologist.  Ouch!  

Say, when are you gonna come and get that door?  I realize now that I have both doors.  But only the passenger door has a good window slider.  Cheers...KR

Can you pass the gascap breather test?  Timed per manufacturers' specs?  Dyno?

Then there's the proctologist.
