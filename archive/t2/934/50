getting eat  up in there hanging up the trhwo out bearing on her beetle  68....??



hey Chai    They make some TOB clips called super clips.  These have a coil 
on the outside to create a spring action, This coil also  allows you to wire 
tie the clip to the crossshaft. Do so not too tightly and the  TOB has to pivot 
some.  later  mark Dearing
