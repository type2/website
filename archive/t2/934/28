That was what precipitated my practice, but the real eye-opener was the
difficulty I had in finding a proper replacement.  I wasted hours and
finally had to settle for an incorrect tire to continue my trip.

With an extra spare I just continue my trip with confidence instead of
trying to hunt down that elusive 185R14C size.  It's also handy in the
winter where I can mount chains on both spares in case I have to chain up.
It's easier to change wheels than it is to put chains on!

If you travel mostly in civilized areas one spare is fine.  If you like to
go into the boonies then two are prudent.
