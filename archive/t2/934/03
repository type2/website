I think that the answer is the difference in the suspension systems
between then and now.  Newer cars don't need as much tire cushioning as
before so tires are getting shorter and stiffer in search of more
immediate response to steering inputs.

Now for our buses I never remember floppy sidewalls being a good thing.
In fact, the radials from the factory were all reinforced.

Now, I don't particularly worry about the ride of my bus, so I like stiff
tires.

I do know from experience that the worst combination is to have stiff
sidewalls on the front tires and floppy sidewalls on the rears.  You end
up with a bus that goes into oscillations with every change of direction.
I drove 400 miles that way once and finally figured it out as I sawed the
wheel back and forth.  Swapped tires front to read and cured the problem.
