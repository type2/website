well brakes brakes brakes... boy i have had my dealings past few weeks now...
  i gotta rebleed my brakes maybe this weekend ... my e brake light comes on when i push the brakes but on the third pump if i pump it wont come on when pushing down on brake pedal.........
   
  i think my problem is i havent bleed mine out right good enough yet and my e brake light is saying that to me... in your case... are you sure your havnt switched the plugs to the wrong ones... not sure if that would matter but maybe..?
   
  everyone by now knows i am not a qaulified brake master .. LOL....
  but my learning it all the hard way will help me better down the road from all the terror i have been through on this...
  good luck 2 us both...

  Hi follow up on the brake warning light - it is still on, except when
depressing the brake pedal.

Decided to test each switch individually by pulling the connection to
the other, one at a time. Both switches successfully activate the
brake lights (rear brake lights), however disconnecting each switch
individually does not make the brake warning light go off.

I will re-bleed everything again in the morning.

Please, if you've seen this before let me know what you think.

FYI, I didn't bench bleed the brake MC but used Bartnick's technique
which I found in the archives:
