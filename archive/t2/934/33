Subject: Re: [T2] sliding door replacement

now that engine is running (reasonably) got around to finishing the
sliding door swap out that I had hoped to have done by John Browns
Buses..over a month ago.  finally got glass in etc etc.  so Friday took
the old door off (those buggers are heavy) swapped out the hardware and
got the new(er) door back on in about 2hrs..... and then to adjust the
door to work smoothly,  two days and about 7 hours of fiddling got the
thing to work reasonably well... dang there were a lot of in/out up/down
backward forward adjustments on that thing.  And I probably started with
every one of them wrong.

   somedays I wonder why I keep this beast, then I get behind the wheel
and it all comes back to me....
