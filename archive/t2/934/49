Subject: Re: [T2] Ham Radio and Bus Pilots

Say, I know some of you guys are techs.  My HF rig is off the air anyhow.  But if you wanted to meet up on IRLP sometime we could have a VW Bus discussion.  I used IRLP some when I was working on ships.  It has grown so fast that there are nodes near most places these days.  I've got an HT I can hit one with from here.  Some request a modest donation.  But it works great.  Anybody interested?  If so, send me where you live and I'll find out where the nearest node is.  Then we'll just set up a time.  If you want to check out the IRLP site it's:  http://www.irlp.net/index.htm

Cheers....KR
