Subject: sliding door track replacement

Hello,

     I am in the process of replacing my passenger's rocker panel and 
possibly the bottom track for the sliding door. on my 73 bus.  I was 
wondering if anyone has done this recently and where I could order a good 
part for this project.  I'm also wondering how much of the rest of this 
whole assembly is included with the part.  I know that the track is welded 
to a support section at a right angle that runs the length of the track.  
The inner and outer rocker panels attatch to this support.  I'm wondering if 
this support is included with the sliding door track or if there are other 
parts I need to buy.  Thanks in advance for your help. -James.
