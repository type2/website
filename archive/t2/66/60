Subject: bosch(cereal box) good reading

Folks,

This morning, wwhile waiting for my coffee to warm up, and noticing the
box for my new Bosch wires, I read the box.....I really should not have.

First thing that caught my eye was "Bosch Premium Wire Set"..hmmmm this is
good.  So I started reading....kinda like the cereal box at breakfast.

Read all sorts of good things including "4 cyl engine, 6 wires in
box"...hmmmmm(in early morning haze)...why *6* wires in box?...ohhh, two
different lengths of coil to cap wires...well...that's ok...now I have an
extra!

*But* Then I read the side panel!!!

Right on the side it states "For American and Asian makes only."!!!!!!!!!

Uhhhh, still in early morning haze....This bus(78 t2) was made in
Germany!(-at-)(-at-)#$%^&*()!!!!  Does this mean that Bosch won't handle the
"Limited Life Time Warranty" if I put these wires on my bus???

So I go back and look at the top of the box and it *clearly* states...
"Fits: Porsche/Volkswagen".

To my knowledge, *no* Porsche has *ever* been made in the good ole'
U.S. of A.

I'm sure the rice burners would enjoy this<grin>....just goes to show...do
*not* read the box!<grin>

BTW the wires worked perfectly well on my "made in Germany" bus....at
least I hope it was made in Germany......<grin>

I just had to go look...yep, the 78 bus  says "Made in West Germany" on
the manufacturing sticker.....ROFL...what do I do now!!!

Merry Christmas, dave
