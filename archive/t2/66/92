Subject: Question for a friend

The dude i trade my '66 to emailed me and said he was getting NO electricals working anywhere in the bus.  Said he checked the battery and it was fine.  No lights, no starting no nothing.  So assuming the battery is good and hooked up correctly, what other things are likely to create this complete lack of power?
