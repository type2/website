Thanks. Chris<<

Chris,

this was a recent topic of discussion on the vanagon list. 

someone reported that they used one of those U-haul wardrobe
boxes to ship 2 vanagon front seats. 
i think they said they had to remove the armrests, though.

also, there was mention of a freight company that would ship
said package for about $40. i think they were called "Forward Air"
or something like that.

HTH.
