Well it is Christmas time and i want this bus gone before it starts snowing 
here in N.IL so I have for free a 1969 camper. Has decent pop-top canvas. 
Body is not really bad. Does have rust but for free you cant complain to 
much. No engine or trans. Clear title. Bus is located in Rockford,IL. Please 
someone come get this bus. Merry Chirstmas.Thanks
