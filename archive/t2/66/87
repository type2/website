>>I am interested in turning the single seat in the back into a cooler.  This 
is the seat that is in between the closet and table.<<

i am assuming you mean the jump seat?

the drain would be easy.  go to your favorite local hardware store & do some
browsing.  get a rubber grommet & some tubing that fits snugly inside of it.
drill a hole that will accept the grommet in the bottom of the plastic.
drill a corresponding hole in the floor of your bus (cringe) to drain the water.
might be a good idea to put a grommet and/or sealant on this hole as well.

seems like a pretty simple concept. have you thought about insulation? a plastic
tub will hold the ice yes, but if its not insulated then the ice is
gonna melt in a hurry on a warm day!

FWIW, i just installed a 76 westy interior with the icebox & i love it.
no more carrying a separate cooler on camping trips.

HTH & good luck.
