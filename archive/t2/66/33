Subject: belt broke / ouch hot gen?

I broke a belt on the xway on the way home yesterday
(1600 sp / gen/ DH) unfortunately it bent my dipstick sender so bad that
it is cracking when I bent it back. bummer.
Heres the rub though.
When I went to replace the belt I almost got burned by the gen pulley nut.
:|
I swapped the engine around 2k back and dont remember ever having a hot
generator before.
I checked it today and indeed the Gen and Pulley do seem to be pretty damn
warm.
Questions.
The plasic bits that cover the pulley side holes where the brushes are. Do
these belong on or off?
Does the gen get air blown through from the shroud?
If so maybe I assembled the backing plate assy wrong or oriented it wrong.
Is there a diagram or an explaination?
Any other thoughts welcome...
TIA
