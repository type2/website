Subject: Oily Air Filter

I have a 74 Riviera, 1.8 ltr, Weber progressive carb that uses the
rectangular filter. I was adjusting the carb the other day and noticed a lot
of oil in the air filter tray, say about 2 tablespoons or more. Any ideas as
to a cause? I am uncertain of the breather element's functionality; is there
a way to tesat them or clean them? Could this be caused by oil viscosity
being too high? I'm running 20/50 synthetic and the temps around here have
lately gone to around freezing at morning start-up time and 40's/50's during
the day. Maybe a switch to 10/40 or 5/50?

Thanks,
Dave
