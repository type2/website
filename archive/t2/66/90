Subject: Starter buttons, ignition switch's and The elimination of

Thsi does not relate to the Type 2's, but it does tell a story of runing
down and eliminating a starting problem I had wth my 85 Vanagon.

It just didn't want to start all the time, when I turned the
key--sometimes it would, sometimes it wouldn't.

I repalced two starter's--( figured the first one was bad )
the ingnition switch, the neutral saftey switch ( automatic ) ran new
signal wire from the saftey switch to the starter solinoid, repaced all
the ground wires and added a few new one's, ran welding cable for the
starter supply wire from the battery, new battery, and the darn thing
was still spuratic, at best.

I was so aggravated, I took a D-8 Cat starter button, ran a wire off the
battery to the switch, and tagged into the solinoid signal wire on the
neutral saftey switch, and the problem was over-----

Direct drive starting--no more CLICK-CLICK, no more crawling under the
Van to jump the solinoid, no more swearing.

Old wiring is crazy--and I eliminated all the hokus pokus, guess what's
next guessing game.

This set up will work well in the bus's also.
