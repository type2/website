Subject: OH CRUEL WORLD!!!!!!!!

My life just sucks as of now.
 Not only did i wreck my 68 singlecab last month but some one saw fit to
pull out into traffic today right into the side of my 70 bus. Just made a
mess. Npw i dont have a work vehicle and we think he is actually isnt even
insured.  I wish i had beed driving the passat instead......
