Definately switch to a lighter weight oil in the winter.  I run 10W30 
synthetic.  Oil in the air box coming from the breather... that's been a 
problem for me also.  I am not sure yet, but I think that excessive blowby 
due to worn rings and/or valve guides is the culprit.  I plumbed in a catch 
can between the breather and the air box which helped some.
