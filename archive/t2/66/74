Volks,
After a lot of testing/contemplation, I think I am going to rig a push bu=
tton for my starter on my 81 vanagon.  It has the classic turn the key no=
thing syndrome.......I can put a rench between the battery lead and termi=
nal 30(maybe 50) and it cranks right up....new solenoid, same result...di=
fferent good starter, same result.............. Checked ignition switch s=
eems fine................3rd time in 1 1/2 years, and i already have the =
Bosch wr-1 kit installed.  Rewiring is a possibility (seems to lose 1 vol=
t from switch to starter on the starter end at the ignition switch lead. =
Prior to this last bout I had been popping fuses in the WR-1 relay kit...=
..15 amp ones.


Is there somewhere on the net that gives a how to?  Would like to have it=
 work only when key is on, then mash button to engage.  =20
