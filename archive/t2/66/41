Subject: Transporter Back Alive/ Thanks

Well, I had a long talk with my landlord this morning
and we had both calmed down a little bit. I'll admit I
may have been acting a little in haste last night but
you have to understand that I was at wits end. It
looks as if both my oil cooler is wet with oil and
there was oil coming out of the rocker arm covers on
the left side. I'm not sure which one. I put new
gaskets in both sets of covers but in the new gasket
set I bought there was a set of eight green rubber
o-rings that came in the same bag as the push rod
cover gaskets (the red and black ones). I replaced the
red and black but I never saw where the green ones
were supposed to go. What are they for!    
    Moving on, My landlord agreed to let me park the
van in his big garage (I live in a sizable warehouse
in boston) and work on it until april for $40 a month.
Things are looking up. When I read everyone's
encouraging e-mails it really perked me up and gave me
something to fight for. Friday I'm gonna sit back down
with the thing and get back down to business. I'll
write with more questions then. And again Thanks. You
guys kept me from making a big mistake and just
quitting a project I've been working on for two
months. 

Fight Forward
