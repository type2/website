Bug Works. Owner's name is Noel Clemmer, as I recall. Years ago when I used
to buy used parts from him for my bus (pre- Bus Depot), his prices were
quite reasonable as far as VW specialty yards go. (In other words, more
expensive than a U-Pull-It yard that might sell you a gas heater for ten
bucks because they don't know what it is, but cheaper than many VW
specialists who might try to gouge you for $300 for said gas heater.) He
used to send along a free Bug Works coffee mug with your order if you were a
regular customer. Don't know if he does anymore, but I still have mine. :-)
