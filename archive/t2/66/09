I think I have another one from radio shack that's a tiny little thing..
wallet sized.. you might want to check if they have them.  It uses
button cells and tests resistance and continuity (beeps).  It also does
voltage.  That's all you need it for with a bus.  Probably 30 bux like
Sean's.. or maybe even the same one..

later,
Mike
