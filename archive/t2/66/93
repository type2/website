I'd think an ice chest under the jump seat would be very easy to design and 
access. I don't have a belt or a way to bolt one in there, and if that's 
standard, while driving at least the chest is out in the open and you only 
have to displace one person at any rate. I'm planning on putting an 
auxilliary battery setup under my (as of yet unacquired) jumpseat, to leave 
the rear left panel open for a gas heater. Seems like it's basically wasted 
space if you don't do something with it.
