Billy:
You are essentially correct on most points. ( I'm a licensed electrial contractor and Master Electrician- at least that's what the certificate says.)
The GFI ONLY provides ground fault protection, not short circuit or overcurrent protection to keep the wires from burning up. Campsite pedestals DO have circuit breakers, but some may be 30 Amp- the ones with the funny diagonal blades.
MOST ALL campsite pedestals should have GFI protection anyhow, but putting another one in could't possibly hurt. The GROUND terminal does NOT need to be connected at all to provide ground fault protection.
Basically, what a GFI does is compare what goes out the hot (black) wire (amperage, not voltage) with what comes back the neutral (white) wire. If there is even the slightest difference
(seems like about in the range of .001 Amp), it shuts off the power in about 1 cycle (1/60 second).
This would possibly occur if the return path went thru your body to ground possibly via the body of your bus and your bare feet.
I liked Scott Fraser's approach of taking apart a plug strip. I suppose that most any good RV store or RV mail order place should have suitable replacement parts.

80 Westy- is it the rustiest 80 westy on the list?

> I would take scott's advice and rig up something to make it work. Keep in mind, a GFI outlet is to provide protection from a short to ground situation (ie water). It acts as a circuit breaker in that particular situation, but perhaps not in other ones (ie: excessive current draw). So a GFI doesn't provide complete safety. Also, I believe they require a real earth ground to perform their function of comparing potential voltages, so unless you tied off to a water pipe, it would be useless anyway. Find a breaker that works for you.
