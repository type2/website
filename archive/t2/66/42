Subject: Removing tension pin in handbrake handle

In one of a flurry of cosmetic improvements to my Westy, I bought a new 
handbrake handle. But I can't get the old one off: The tension pin (Bentley 
calls it a rolled pin) seems to be in there for keeps. I've used a punch and 
a drill and tried to press it out too.

I've uploaded an image of the culprit here:

Any ideas?
