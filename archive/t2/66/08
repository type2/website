Subject: Re: [T2] Which meter to buy

Sean:

I got a nice general purpose multi-meter (volts, ohms, amps) at Radio Shack
several years ago for something like $30 or so, and it's worked just fine.
It has nice long leads, a small, swing-out wire "stand" that allows me to
set it upright, and a large, clear readout that's easy to see.

I use it once or twice a year on my '81, I'm careful with it (no greasy
hands, no dropping down into the engine, etc.) and I expect it'll last as
long as I care to use it.

You can spend a heck of a lot more for these items, but unless you're using
a multi-meter every day, why bother?
