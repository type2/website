Subject: Back seat ice chest.

Tracy, the '76-'79 westy had an arm rest cooler that just has a drain out
through the floor.  This is a really neat way to drain the cooler as you
never have any standing water, and so nothing is floating.  These ice
chests are very well insulated and even in hot weather, the ice lasts a
long time.  Another plus of this system is the fact that it is VERY handy
to get to, you don't have to move anything to get in there and if you are
sitting on the seat, it is right under your arm.  I would think an under
seat ice chest would be very hard to design, insulate and seal not to
mention try to get into, I can hear it now, "all of you will have to get up
so I can get into the ice chest", not very handy.
