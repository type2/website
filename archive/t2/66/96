Have him check the main power wire to the fuse block to make sure it didn't
fall off.

The dude i trade my '66 to emailed me and said he was getting NO electricals
working anywhere in the bus.  Said he checked the battery and it was fine.
No lights, no starting no nothing.  So assuming the battery is good and
hooked up correctly, what other things are likely to create this complete
lack of power?
