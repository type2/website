I feel certain Al Basse is on the right track. Go one step further with the
jiggle tech. Jiggle at the back of the fuze block, the starter and the
light switch. Umong those three items comes all 12v feeds except the
starter/alternator. Since the items affected have independant grounds, it
is highly unlikely the glitch is in the ground side of things.

Disconnect the battery ground a'cause what follows can zap things faster
than the speed of Ali in his prime, or even Donahue in an 800hp Porsche at
Talladega. Now check the terminals at the big bolt on the starter. Replace
any that show heat stress. Brighten them all with 220 grit. Snug the nut
down till it comes up firm, but don't lean on it too hard, just tight
enough to insure it won't come loose on it's own and the terminals are
pressed together fully. Then dismount the fuze panel and pull it down and
look over all the big (10/12 ga) red & red/white wire terminals. Replace
any that show heat stress or don't fit snug. Then check the terminals at
the light switch. Dismount it and pull it down where you can quite
uncomfortably put the eye/light tech on it. Pop out the instrument pod for
much easier access to the light switch.
