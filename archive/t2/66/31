Subject: THANKS and Question...

First, before i ask the next question in the long slow process of "vw zen 
troubleshooting mastery", i want to thank the guru's, and apprentices for 
all the mutual information shared in past posts. My 77 is happy, although 
the 73 continues to be a PITA!
Now, since i have dutifully scoured the archives, and still seek answers, i 
continue with the "gas in oil" thread.
Q: I installed a fuel pressure regulator on my, ahem, NAPA fuel pump to make 
sure it was not pushing fuel through the carbs too fast and flooding the 
cylinders ('73 bus dual 34pict 1800cc). the oil still smells like gas after 
being in there for less than 100 miles. i noticed someone said there is an 
adjustment that limits the amount of fuel jetted into the carb intake. is 
this what i should be attending to, or am i still on the wrong track? any 
hints here would be appreciated.
-Jeremy
