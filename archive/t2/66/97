and then there is the one that drives you nuts!?  my starter has been
driving me to drink for couple years now. when it works it works great,
when it doesn't, it doesn't

I have tried all of the accepted (and quite a few not so
accepted) methods to correct it.  There is no pattern and I am a fanatic
about trying to find patterns to solve intermitent problems. 
 replaced wiring, good 10 gauge stuff
 new ground cable
 replaced all the connectors with new, checked out.
 soldered em on
 new twin 1,000 amphour batteries.
 changed the selector lock out switch (automatic)
 
none of this has changed a dang thing, I have three starters operation is
identical with all three.  recently had the best Bosch essentially
blueprinted back to original spec.  nadda!

about the only thing that keeps me from being stranded is the "mechanic's
bump switch" I mounted in the engine compartment some years ago for tune
ups etc.  it is hard wired to the soenoid so it so far has always worked,
but it means getting out and going around to engine compartment to
operate

it appears to be a voltage drop because when it doesn't start or crank you
can hear the starter sort of hum a little.

I have bought one of the relay kits from Bus Depot but haven't installed
it.  but I am running out of things to look for?????

I do have to agree and I have over the 30+ years of owning old VW's done
some "interesting" patches to get home.

the last couple automatics, which don't push start!

throw old part into back of van just in case of part "infant
mortality" seems a lot of that going around lately.  after a couple weeks
or so of working correctly, then the part gets garaged
