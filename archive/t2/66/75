Subject: Re: [T2] Push Button Starter

Here is the starting sequence:
Ignition key turned to starting position: Fuel Pump On/Cold Start
Injector On/Starter Motor On/Ignition Coil On/ECU On (other instruments
etc on)
Ignition key in run position: Fuel Pump Passed off to [ECU/AFM/Double
Relay] /Ignition Coil On/
So if you want to bypass that ignition switch you need to have a standard
ignition switch and a starter button.
That Vanagon Ignition switch fits a lot of VWs, not just Vanagons but a
lot of others as well. They are normally "Gimmies" at the wrecking yards
I go to as long as I've got $25.00 of other bigger stuff.
In addition the switch has a solder (fused) point in it that can be
repaired.
I've found the turn the key  = nothing to be loose push on connectors at
the starter or solenoid plunger locked by light coating of dust/grease
buildup.
