Subject: Re: [T2] Which meter to buy

Sean,

This is gonna sound funny, but... for auto work I prefer an old analog
radio sha** multimeter.  It was not more than about $12 and does all
things electrical.  I also have used digital and have a very expensive
digital meter...I hate it except that it talks to my pc.

You do need one with a fairly large face(all the better to read with).

You want one with the largest face and highest "ohms/volt" rating.

Cheers, dave
