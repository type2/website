Subject: RE: Carb Icing

I'm currently helping a buddy install a 2.0L in his '73 Deluxe
7-passenger.  As the PO was trying to convert it to 1600 dp there is no
Carbs or F/I available.

We are installing the Weber 2 barrel set-up with a stock single vac.
advance distributor.  After talking to a couple local mechanics he had
some concerns about Carb icing.

We are fabricating a preheat set-up using the stock preheat tin from a
'73-'74 Transporter.  This routes warm air up from the right side engine
cylinder tin to a hole in the forward "firewall" tin to a plenum into
which the air cleaner diverter valve sits.  We going to try using the
stock dual carb air cleaner box cut to fit the top of the weber with the
left side closed off.

Hopefully I'll be able to get some pics of what we do up on a website
before the end of the month ( if Santa brings me that digital camera
that I asked for).

At any rate, I'll be posting the results  within a week or so (we're
doing the intial start-up/ running trials this weekend).
