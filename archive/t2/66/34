If the needle's and seat's in the carbs are shot, the pressure regulator
was a waste of time and money---

But how does the engine run?

If it was runnig that rich to make the oil smell, it most certainly
would be running awful rich---
Put you nose up to the tailpipe, you should be able to smell the unburnt
gas---
Have you checked the spark plug's, to see how they have been burning?

If they are black, I would venture to say somethings screwed up with the
carbs---

Later,

Terry

First, before i ask the next question in the long slow process of "vw
zen troubleshooting mastery", i want to thank the guru's, and
apprentices for all the mutual information shared in past posts. My 77
is happy, although the 73 continues to be a PITA! 
Now, since i have dutifully scoured the archives, and still seek
answers, i continue with the "gas in oil" thread. 
Q: I installed a fuel pressure regulator on my, ahem, NAPA fuel pump to
make 
sure it was not pushing fuel through the carbs too fast and flooding the
cylinders ('73 bus dual 34pict 1800cc). the oil still smells like gas
after being in there for less than 100 miles. i noticed someone said
there is an adjustment that limits the amount of fuel jetted into the
carb intake. is this what i should be attending to, or am i still on the
wrong track? any hints here would be appreciated.
