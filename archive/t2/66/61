Simple equation:  VW bus locks= Steve Sandlin

ssandlin(-at-)lcc.net  

Don't know him personally, but he's active on
vanagon.com.  I've never heard a bad word about his
work or his prices.  He loves vw vans.  He'll rekey
everything, cut news keys and all that.  He has some
locks sitting around, but maybe you'll have to buy the
engine compartment lock from busdepot or someone else.
 

Peace and blessings,
