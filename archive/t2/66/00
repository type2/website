Subject: Re: [T2] Carburetor Icing (was: FI vs. Progressive carb)

Steve,
I'll add my .02 here. What your refering to is Bernoulli's principle,
something familiar to pilots,especially here in the great white north. Its
what keeps our planes in the air and also what causes our carbs to ice. Its
the constant of total energy, i.e. as air flows thru your carb, it has to
speed up as it passes thru the venturi, as it speeds up it's pressure
decreases (speed and pressure have to remain constant) as it losses pressure
it cools. Carb icing is a component of ambient temp and the dew point and
happens at a lower temp than you would suspect. My chart show it to be most
likely at a temp of around 32 to 60deg F and a dew point of between also 32
to 60 deg F. btw this is on av gas and is for severe icing so you can see
icing would have started at a higher temp. So the short story is if you've
got a coolish day and a fair amount of humidity, you'll have icing. I think
here is where FI would be a benefit,as without a carb you don't have a
venturi and you don't have a problem.
