Subject: More ignition switch woes


My 72 has an ignition problem that is a little different than most.

It was acting up when trying to start and I let Tim's German Auto Service
in Ft. Worth do the work of pulling the steering wheel, etc etc... They put
it together and no problems. Started fine....

After about 15 starts from that day in September, the switch failed hard.

No power. It just didn't power up anything, much less crank the engine.

I looked at it for about 5 minutes. Wiggled it until I thought I was going
to go blind. Walked into the house for a glass of water.... when I came
back out, it powered up and cranked. I drove it the 600 yards from my in-
laws to my house. Turned it off, and that is the way it stands...

It will not do anything anymore. It is dead. I drive my 75 Westy mostly so
I have let it sit, until I had the time and the nerve to re-yank the
steering wheel and pull the thing apart.

Even then, I don't think I will have a clue what to look for. How can you
tell what need fixing? I really don't want to change out the lock and key...
I could haul it back in, but it has been months since I was there....

Avisame, amigos. I can follow the instructions. I just don't know where to
start....
