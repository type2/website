Now a Simpson is a quality meter. The thing that analog meters do beter
than a cheap digital is at low resistance readings. You need a pretty
decent digital meter to distinguish differences in the less than 1 ohm
ranges. This is not a task for even a modest analog meter.
Analog meters need more messing with and you need to calibrate the
zero etc.. Like an old bus. A digital meter just works and is simpler to
understand.
