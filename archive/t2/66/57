Subject: Westfalia front table & stool questions, and PA, WV salvage yards

I junkyard scrounged a front table from a Westfaliathis past weekend. I mean 
the one that hooks to the dash via little 'footman loops' that screw into the 
dash, and the table extends back over the shifter.
I was able to get the dash brackets for it, but there was no sign of the 
table leg.
I was figuring on just making a leg out of pipe or conduit, but I'd like to 
make it look somewhat original.  Is this leg a sort of bare metal/galvanized 
color like the rear table leg, or is it painted? 
If someone has one, could you tell me how long it is supposed to be?
(or, if someone has one they don't need...)
I was also able to get the little stool/trash box out of the same bus.
The problem is that it is the orange plaid fabric, and it clashes pretty hard 
with the green in my '78.  Does someone out there have a torn or worn bed or 
seat cover of the correct color fabric that they would part with?  I need 
about 1 square foot to recover the stool.
Lastly, my cousin has just recently saved a '75 westy and he needs some 
parts.  There is rumored to be a VW salvage yard in or near Morgantown, WV.  
Anybody know where it is or what it's called?
Ditto with one an hour or two (roughly) north of Pittsburgh, PA.
Anybody been to these places?
Many thanks,
