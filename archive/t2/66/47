Hang in there.
Dig down to find the strength to enable you to pass through this moment of 
frustration and anguish.

Tomorrow should be a little bit better, and the next day will be a little 
more better.

If I had it in my power to make your buses all better for you, I would do 
it in a heartbeat.
I hurt for you as well.
