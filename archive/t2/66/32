Subject: Re: [T2] 120V GFI in 71 Westy?

you can buy a surge suppressor with one in it and take it all apart, or you can try a place like DigiKey
http://www.digikey.com

Look at this one and see if it might work.
This one is rated at 15 amps, and they have other current ratings also.

> I've looked through the archives, and the concensus seems to be that the little button next to the 120V outlet is a circuit breaker.  Unfortunately the button on mine has long since broken off making resetting a little difficult.  My question is: Can I simply install a GFI outlet instead, and just exclude the breaker altogether?  If not, does anyone know of a source for a replacement breaker?
