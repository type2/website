Subject: electrical short??


My 75 FI Bus is having an electrical problem. The whole electrical system 
shorts out: radio, lights, everything. It happens sporadicaly and its only 
for a breif period of time; it usually dosen't stall the engine; just causes 
the bus to sputter and lurch forward. I thought maybe the short was in the 
ignition switch but I can't seem to reproduce the problem by jiggling the 
key. Can anyone suggest how I should go about finding the source of this 
problem?
Thanks,
Darin
