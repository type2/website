Wayne,

Here are most of my pictures:

I think the model of Sanden I have is SD-508, maybe SD509 (can't recall) 
but I think you could get just about any one to work.
My A/C is still working well five years later although I am not currently 
using the smog pump assembly - I'm using a similar assembly from a Porsche 
912 that I am borrowing from a very generous listmember.  This Porsche 
assembly has no rubber donut, but instead has a solid shaft.  I don't 
notice any more vibration than normal.

As for the smog pump pulley assembly not being up to the job (because of 
the rubber donut), well it's true BUT it worked for quite a while for me, 
and might have lasted much longer if I had been more careful.  I started 
out never turning on the A/C while the engine was running so there would be 
no jarring shock to the rubber isolator.  It's only when I got sloppy and 
turned it on with the engine running that it broke, and even then it took a 
while.  Mine was in very good condition though - I've seen many where the 
rubber was starting to crack and they wouldn't last very long with the load 
of the A/C.
