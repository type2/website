OMG!

Given that his last car, an early 90s Saab, seized the engine on the highway
because of a broken water pump only 6 weeks ago he's in surprizing good
spirits.

It appears to have been in bad shape before he purchased it. The amount of
grunge under the engine was heavy but I couldn't find any oil leaks; they
all seemed to have been delt with in the past judging by the repair
receipts. The only place I found oil was the oil pressure switch that
appeared broken (oil on plastic) but behaved correctly.

I wish I could have done an oil pressure test before he put so many miles on
this bus when he first bought it.
