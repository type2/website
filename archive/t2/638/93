Probably about 10 seconds. When a valve head decides to let go or the 
retainer on the valve stem breaks, you get no warning. By the time you pull 
to the side of the road, the damage is done. I saw this on an engine that 
came into the shop in Pittsburgh. The retainer cracked, the intake valve 
got sucked in and it was all over in about 2.4 seconds at 50 MPH. The parts 
that were left weren't even really very identifiable, just some pieces of 
valve, a big hole in the piston, and most of the head was eaten away and 
cracked in half. It also stressed the case and divoted the rod bearing. At 
3000 RPM you are trying to compress those valve pieces 50 times per second. 
The other three cylinders are more than happy to provide force while this 
is happening. You can't shut the engine down fast enough to prevent serious 
damage at highway speeds.
