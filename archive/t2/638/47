Subject: 75 FI wont idle after engine reinstall

I recently removed the bone stock FI engine on my 1975
Westy to put a sleeve in a stripped spark plug hole. 
Prior to the plug firing out without the intention of
screwing back in, my bus ran perfectly.  Now that I
have put the engine back in, it wont idle at all, and
the timing is all but impossible to set (tried
statically and with a timing light).  I have triple
checked all my vacuum hoses and connections.  I also
tried everything that John Muir suggests in his book,
as well as Bentley for trouble shooting the FI system.
 I am at a total loss for what I should do next.  Does
anyone have any suggestions?  Any advice is greatly
appreciated.  

Also, thanks to everyone who provided advise on
repairing my engine.  This list is the best!  Thanks
especially to Richard Atwell for the amazing resources
on his website!
