Whoa!  I've *never* seen an air cooled VW with an accesory switch
on the ignition switch!

Can you tell me where to get one of these for my 78 bus and other vw cars?

I can absolutely verify that you won't harm the pertronix, but you will 
absolutely fry your coil if you leave the ign switch on and happen to have 
the "points" in a closed position...did it two weeks ago by mistake.  Left 
it on unintentionally for about 30 minutes....the coil was so hot that I 
burned fingers on it...and it swelled and the oil started leaking out.


Cheers, dave
