Guys,

Just put a toggle switch in for this.  you can mount it somewhere under 
the dash.

One direction causes the radio to pull power from the always on wire and 
the other direction causes it to pull power from the wire that is only on 
when the ignition switch is on.

The best of both worlds....when *you* want it...

A few bucks at radio shack.

Cheers, dave
