Hi Richard,

I use a short 1" socket with 3/8" drive... The electrical contact for 
the switch sticks up into the 3/8" square opening in the top of the 
socket, and I turn it using a 4" 3/8" extension that has been notched 
to fit over the electrical contact. It's not elegant, but it works.

Happy trails,
