Richard,

Pop the valve covers and start looking for a dropped valve.  Really only 
too reasons to sieze while running...

Dropped valve or pistons seized....since you had plenty of oil, I would 
suspect a valve.

Was this the one being driven for the first time in a long time?....maybe 
the pistons weren't getting oiled correctly, although I would be more 
suspicious of a dropped valve.

72 type 4, IIRC?

The only other possiblility was that the starter has jammed, or something 
in the bell housing is jammed in the flywheel.....I have seen screwdrivers 
left in the bell housing that caused this....

Cheers, dave
