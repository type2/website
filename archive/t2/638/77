I have also heard this lower number is normal for FI.

> For my stock '79 California bus with the DVDA distributor, the timing
spec is 5 degrees ATDC at 850  RPM..  If I time it to this
specification I will get 11 - 12 inches Hg at best.  If I advance
timing 7.5 BTDC, then readjust idle to the specified 850 RPM, I will
get 15 to 17 inches Hg.
