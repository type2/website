Yes it is. This is clearly noted on the product details page. If you scroll
down below the description on a Bus Depot product details page (which you
access by clicking on the item when it comes up on a list), it shows you
what vehicles/years the part fits. In the case of the jack, it fits all Bus
and Vanagon (except those with the plastic rocker panel moldings).
