Subject: Re: [T2] URGENT! '68 bus engine question

It's likely if not probable that the CASE was from an earlier engine.
The size could still be 1600 instead of the 1500 the case shipped as.

Your bus has probably gone through at least 2 engine
rebuilds/replacements, so the serial number on the case doesn't really
mean much.

The real question is: does it have good compression? If so and the
engine is providing strong power, it doesn't really matter from a
practical perspective.
