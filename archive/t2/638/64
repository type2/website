Subject: a/c pulley

A question for the a/c folks.

The 72 bus that just seized has an a/c compressor installed. The weird thing is that the pulley is on the oil cooler side. The belt isn't hooked up and I can't figure out in my head how it would have been driven by the main pulley. Was it installed backwards?

This is an a/c setup I've never seen before. The evaporator is under the jump seat behind the driver and there is a huge condenser under the body with two electric fans. There are VPC logos on the evaporator.
