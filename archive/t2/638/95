Subject: Info on alternator light

Here is an interesting quote from the Type 2 library:

"The alt-light is effectively connected *between* battery (+) and alternator 
output, so it indicates when either side is low, though not both(!). Hence 
it's on when the ignition is on but before the engine is started and also if 
the engine is running but the battery getting low or the alternator isn't 
producing output. "

So, when my battery was getting low AND my alternator was not producing 
output, my light WOULD NOT BE ON!!!

Now I understand....

Barry
