Ralph,

I would say so.  As I said before, Ron at BD was mystified as to why no 
one else had said anything to him about the compressors actually fitting.

The obvious answer is like yours...people bought them, but haven't tried 
installing yet.

Do your hose connection ports some out on the rear of your 
compressor...then, yes, you will have to change.

See if you can test fit it first!


Cheers, dave
