I wired my stereo directly to a permanent hot wire
so that I don't have to have the ignition on to 
power up. I have fried a pertonics before while
leaving the ignition on to listen to the radio. I 
think it depends on if the ignitor is in firing 
position or not. Even with points your coil can still
blow while storing energy without release.
