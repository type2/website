Subject: double relays and radios

AFAIK-The stock wireing for a bus radio is to a always hot ckt. I cant
think of an older VeeDub that I have seen where the power to the radio
was switched. On newer radios you have to have at least one connection
to a always hot source to keep the memory (selected stations/time etc)
anyway. I dont think pertronix is damaged by leaving the key on. The
problem, as I understand it, is with points.If they happen to be closed
when you turn off the engine.. and you put the key in the on postion 
then they will burn up (weld closed). If they are in the open position
when the key is turned to the on position then no damage is done...
kind of a crap shoot.

AFAIK-All igniton switches should have a "on" or accessory position. If
your bus doesnt then you need a new one.

---just a thought----
The double relay seems to be a problem for a lot of people. While I
have never had to deal with them.. therefore I dont completly
understand the
full function.. it seems to me that you could pick up a early 80's VW
relay..like for a rabbit. It energizes briefly with the key in the on
position..this brings up the pressure on the system...then it shuts the
pump off and looks for a signal from the coil.. which it gets when the
engine starts running. As soon as it sees this signal then it energizes
the pump again. This setup would eliminate dependancy on the AFM 
connection...
--disclaimer.. I have been surprised by the difference in buses over
the
years so statements one and two may vary from year to year... but I
dont think so. The rabbit relay is a fuel pump relay (sez it right on
the
relay) not a generic 12 VDC relay.. which would be single action.

Random thoughts at 5 AM.. :-)
