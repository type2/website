I have the Cali book and recommend after doing a BAS 911 conversion instead (www.ahnendorp.com) to simply relocate the cooler under the car to catch air when the car is moving. I relocated the stock cooler down there. I also used a CB Performance thermostat to limit flow to a second cooler+fan with electric thermostat (big flat stacked cooler) for idling and city traffic. Cooler, fan and thermostat was spotted once at Pep Boys too. 

No pressure problems apparently, and never any heat problems. The fan would cycle in traffic after a July highway run. 

Engine is/was in a '65 Beelte. Both coolers are outside the engine compartment.
