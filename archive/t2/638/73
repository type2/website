Subject: Engine seized

The last Type 4 I blew up had the temp flaps removed, but the flap at the 
oil cooler was still there, hanging in the air, and blocking air flow to #4 
and melted my piston. Coincidentally, the valve keeper at #1 broke through 
the retainer disc and the valve hammered #1 at the same time. With the small 
fan nut on Type 4, you can't get much torque to try to turn the engine by 
hand, so I pulled the starter and gently pried at the flywheel teeth with a 
pry bar to see if the engine could be turned at all. If not, you'll have to 
pull the heads, though a friend;s motor seized when a piece of piston skirt 
wedged under a cam lobe. Another blown type 4 I was given had a spark plug 
fall between #3 and #4, cutting off the cooling air and causing it to seize.

Good luck. Hope your friend doesn't get discouraged!

John
