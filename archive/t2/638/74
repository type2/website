OK gang,

I have on my living room floor a small pile of thermostat bits.  Could 
someone help me with the order of things?  Does the rectangular washer 
go on the bolt side or the thermostat side of the bracket?

OK, next question.  The one thing I couldn't find (separately) was a 
pulley.  From the archives, I learned that a sliding door roller should 
work.  Is there any special hardware to attach the pulley to the case, 
or does it just bolt on?  I'm kind of scared, since reliable sources 
say the hole goes right through into the block!  Should I use some sort 
of thread sealant to hold back the oil?  I'm going to use a bike shift 
cable, since they seem a lot higher quality than the originals and have 
the right head shape.

Is it OK to leave the lower tin off for a test run to make sure 
everything works down there once it's together?

And, finally, what's the consensus on NLA tin plug substitutes?  I have 
two holes near the flap rod (one of which the thermo cable must come 
through) and the oil sender hole unplugged at the moment.  Are there 
high temp grommets available or something else to rig up in place of 
the genuine articles?

Thanks so much for all the help.  I've been to nervous to drive it 
since finding the missing 'stat.  It's been below freezing here in 
sunny Montana.  We're ready to get the bus back on the road, so we can 
find more problems!

all the best,
