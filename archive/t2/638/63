Old(er) tires are always dicey...I don't know of any way to tell
the condition of the tire...Another list I'm on (admittedly about
a much pricier antique car) recommends three years ond out
for tires (YMMV, of course... ;-(
Usage seems to be the best method of getting the most mile-
age out of tires...I got a few pairs of wire wheels for another
of my orphans and it was hell to just get the old rubber off the
rims... ;-(
