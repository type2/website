I thought the hole was blind...the bolt is weird looking. It only has
partial threads so the pulley can spin but the threaded part of the bolt is
a smaller diameter than the shaft part.

watch it move.

One is for a tin screw and the other was a pathetic rubber grommet that was
glued to the bottom of the tin:
