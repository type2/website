How far off was your %CO?  I would think you should be able to come in 
well under.  On my '76 California smog'd a bit over a year ago (before 
engine rebuild, and, granted, on the old static idle/2500rpm test):

     %CO    MAX    AVE    MEAS
     idle   2.50   0.50   0.32
     2500   3.00   0.90   0.00

     HC PPM MAX    AVE    MEAS
     idle   250     73     146
     2500   200     67      69

I realize that this is somewhat an apples-to-oranges comparison; I'm 
pretty sure the MAX specs for an '82 are tighter than for a '76.  But 
considering how similar our engines are (both with cat and EGR, both 
with Pertronix, both with L-Jet FI), you should certainly be able to 
achieve the MEAS numbers that my old, tired, desperately needing a 
rebuild engine did.

(My next smog is going to be done with a CDI installed; I'm very 
curious to see the results from that test.)

Anyway, If you're fairly certain that everything else is in-tune, then 
it sounds to me like you do in fact need to lean it out a bit more.  
Strange about your O2 sensor ... are you sure the sensor itself isn't 
duff?  Is it a new part, or yard-scavenged?  Maybe you have an exhaust 
leak?
