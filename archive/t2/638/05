Subject: Spotted!  (really)

Leopard spotted late bay Westy in Bowling Green Ohio.
Anybody on the list?  I was in my primer gray Vanagon.
(no front grills, round headlights)
I hadn't driven through town in a while and took the
trip on a whim... we both rubber-necked at each other,
but didn't get a chance to wave. (I was holding a coke
and french fries while driving- kids don't try this at
home)
Just wavin hello.
