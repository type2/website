Subject: CDI (plug gap Q)

Hello, List.  

Recent posts about CDI reminded me that I have a
nice shiny red one that needed to be installed on
my 70 westfakia.  So I did it.  Wired it up, but
it's not mounted yet.  I think I'll wire it on
the bulkhead like everyone else.  

Jason, regarding you're wiring question,
bypassing the CDI (mine is a Mallory from ACN)
involves only repositioning the black wire
(ignition +) to the + of the coil and the wire
from the points to the - side of the coil.  As I
am running a Pertronix, I would also have to
connect the red wire from the Petronix to the +
side of the coil.  The kit included mail and
female crimp on adapters and if you do it right,
it's simply a matter of disconnecting and
reconnecting to switch.  

Anyway, it works.  I put in NGK plugs gapped at
.045.  I needed to adjust my carb after I
installed the Mallory and NGK's.

John recommended .040 - .045 stating that this is
the limit if one expects to be able to switch the
system to regular coil in the event of a CDI
failure.  However, if I'm not concerned about
regapping or putting in new plugs in the event of
failure, I assume I can go wider?  What are the
limits to plug gap on an otherwise stock 1600 DP
w/ Bosch coil painted blue.  

Happy bussin'
Ray
