Subject: Re: [T2] Vredestein tires up for grabs....

I am not sure if the rotation is marked or not.  I am also unsure of the
age.  I know though, that the vehicle was used on a daily basis for the last
year or so and was not put in storage.

Good point...Tires age, even if they're not in use...Worse, if they've
been holding up a stored or unused vehicle...They can get flat spots
which show up as that little bump, bump, bump ride... ;-(
I'm pretty sure newer tires even have a manufacturing date stamped
into the sidewall...
