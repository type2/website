Tom:

I've tried this same thing using the installed o2 sensor (new) on my 79 
California bus and was unable to get conclusive readings.  Are you 
using a heated sensor?  Though I've not tried it, my thought was that 
maybe the sensor is not getting hot enough, particularly at idle and a 
heated sensor might help alleviate this problem.
