Hi Folks,

Not to belabor this thread, but if you have one of those new-fangled 
digital-type radios, it needs a constant-hot lead to "trickle" power for its 
preset memory and anti-theft code.  If you hook it up to a switched lead, 
remember to hook the trickle up to a constant-hot.  If you hook it up to a 
constant-hot lead, remember to switch it off when you switch off the 
ignition (unless you're listening to NPR...).

As for an ACC point on the switch, I don't think Buses had them.  There's 
Lock/Off, On, and Start, but you can also get Unlock/Off if you move the key 
just a bit towards On.  This is good for towing, pushing, and front end work 
without having the ignition on.

As always, YMMV.  Good Luck!
