Subject: Alternator Plug Question

I went to a FLAPS  to have my 78 alternator checked.  The FLAPS only had a 
3-way female plug to mach my alternators 3-way female plug.

Well, I figured that if I put in three male-to-male spades in my 3-way 
female connector, I could plug in the testers 3-way female plug.

You have to use your imagination for this.

But things did not work out as well as I expected.

Questions:

1 Should I have chris-crossed the bottom two connectors between my 
alternators plug and the testers plug??  Yesterday, I  built a pigtail on 
three wires with male connectors on each end, so I can match my 3-way female 
plug with combinations to the testers 3-way female plug

2 What is the function of each of these three elements of my alternators 
3-way plug??

3 There is another small (black) wire that comes out of the alternator 
harness near the 3-way plug that connects to something that goes into 
another wire in another loom that goes forward through the firewall.  To 
what does the wire thru the firewall go??

Thanks

Barry
