I think I might have the same setup on my '79 Westy... The compressor is on
the side of the motor (driver's side) and the pulley is on the front side of
the compressor (towards the front of the bus) - I could not figure out how
the compressor pulley was driven (i.e. Where was the pulley on the motor?).


 

I thought, based on previous threads and looking at the setup, that the
compressor might be backwards.  While the tin is cut to fit the compressor,
the tin is intact on the back side of the compressor (the back of the bus
side).  So, I've been wondering - if the compressor in backwards and how
could that happen - if it is backwards why is the tin not cut - if the
compressor is not in backwards, where the heck is the pulley on the motor?  

 

If anyone has any pictures showing this type of setup that is connected - I
would really appreciate seeing what it is supposed to look like.  Oh BTW,
how do you get the belt on the pulley?

 

TIA,

 

Wayne

Richard,

         The setup is correct.  The belt goes in FRONT of the fan housing
(between the housing and the engine) and connects to a pulley behind the fan
hub.  It would be a decent system if it used a standard sized belt.

I have heard of that type before, but never laid eyes on one.
