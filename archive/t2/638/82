Oh,
When I read "1700 upright", I went right on into upright conversion mode.
Sorry about that.....

Hi Mark,

I never said that it was a conversion, though that does sound
interesting.

85.5 pistons and a 74 mm crank makes a 1699cc type1.

Dad flies out to meet the new bus tomorrow, so when we get more info
about the vehicle I will pass it along to the lists.


Happy trails,
