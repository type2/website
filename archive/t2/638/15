ok i have a set of brand spanking new solex carbs that i just bought and have few miles on them..............

I hate them and that is saying it at the least.
i was warned about the duals just duals in general and gave them my best shot anyways,.
i just cant seem to get them right and learned to appreciated the weber i had or was borrowing than these things.
to much trouble for me keeping them in shape and adjusted and all...
like i said they are brand new just bought from CB performance.
if anyone would like these they come complete with manifolds and all.
I just need a manifold and rebuilt/new weber progressive to stick back on my daily driver.
i have one that i have borrowed but it doesnt work.
i have had enough headaches with the duals.
having to borrow the synch tool to adjust them and all its just more than i bargained for i believe and if had it to do obver would have just bought a new weber which is why i am here now asking for one now.

anyone interested let me know?
ps these carbs arent junk and would appreciate the same in return when figuring for a swap/trade for a weber it has to be in good shape and rebuilt no damaged mixture screw seat or anything crazy...
these are new carbs that i am asking to trade for about the same thing weber wise.
peace and love
