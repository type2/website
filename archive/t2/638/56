OK,
You mention a 1700 w/ an upright conversion.  How exciting!  I'm in the
middle of this very project, so I thought I'd offer some thoughts from
where I see it.  There are a few different ways to do the upright
conversion, but basically, very similar concepts.  I'm doing the "Cali"
conversion, which uses a modified type 1 fan shroud.  But some things to
keep in mind:
   spare oil lines.  The upright conversion relocates the stock oil cooler
   into the upright fan shroud, just like the type 1.  Oil lines route the
   oil from the type 4 location to the type 1 location in the shroud, and
   back.  I would run with enough high temp/high pressure oil line to
   relace it all.  (about 2 feet).
   Also, enough oil to relace all the oil, in the unlikely event that a
   hose fails, and you lose all / most of your oil.
   HEAT : the upright conversion leaves many avenues to pursue regarding
   exhaust systems.  Many disregard the need for heat.  This could be a
   consideration if you plan to drive to Canada in December.
   Some upright conversions disregard the need for a thermostat,  this
   could cause some problems if you plan to drive to Canada in December.
   Some upright conversions use an alternator, some use a generator,  so
   think about that when planning a repair kit for your trip.
   Some upright conversions may use a different size belt to drive the fan
   / alternator - than stock type 1 or 4.  So maybe be sure to have a
   replacement belt that will fit this engine.
That is all that comes to mind....  If I think of anything else, you folks
will be the first to know...
Thanks!
Mark
