Subject: Louver Window Rebuild Kit Experience Needed

Howdy

I was wondering if anybody had bought the LOUVERED (JALOUSIE) WINDOW SEAL 
kit from either Wolfsburg West or OE Veedub.

http://www.oeveedub.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=231-069-413&Category_Code=t2sk-ws&Product_Count=1

And if you did what your experience is with the quality.

The OE one seems to be quite a bit more and I was wondering if it were worth 
the extra money as I have to get other seals from them anyway.

Thanks
Kevin
