Subject: Re: [T2] Engine seized

Hi Dave,

The other reason is bearings. Endplay can be a factor in this. One of 
the Canadian buses attending EveryBus 2004 had a lot more excitement 
than expected when the main bearing tightened up. The engine would  
turn with the starter, but not by hand. When the owner opened it up a 
few weeks later the bottom end was pretty ugly.  Heck, I had a bus 
engine throw a rod right through the oil-bath air filter once... not 
pretty. It's possible that something slightly less obvious could have 
happened in this case. (double meaning unintentional)

I do agree that it'd be a good idea to look at the valves first, 
they're a lot easier to get at. And if there's nothing wrong you 
haven't wasted any time, since the covers are coming off to pull the 
heads and split the case anyway.


Happy trails,
