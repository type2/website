Great ubersite for lookin' for books; especially used or OOP... ;-)
Just go to the used directory, plug in whatcha lookin' for an'
the man behind the curtain reels off a list of available titles,
sorted by price...
Even if the book you want is unavailable right now, there's a
wish list so if it comes up for sale, they'll email you... ;-)
