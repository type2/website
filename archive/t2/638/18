Subject: NC trip report --- long

With hands hooked around the bar and my pinkies around the steering wheel
proper, I left for Winston Salem from Wilmington. I'd already gassed up with
hi test (as always) and was on the road by 7:15am. I decided to avoid I-40 and
instead take US 421.
I figured that this would be a good scouting report for EveryBus 2005! For
those Bus pilots in southeastern NC and northeastern SC, you'll be glad to
know that US 421 has long stretches of freshly repaved roads. The cooler
weather --- 57 degrees, for you hosers in Canada:-) --- meant the nose of the
Bus was much cleaner than in the buggier summer trips to NYC and DC.
I remember Greg Potts saying that mileage decreases after 60 mph, so I played
with that. I cruised at 60 for a very few minutes, then kept it at 55 for
around an hour and a half. I gassed up in Siler City ($2.17 hi test) and found
that I was getting 18.89 mpg. I drove the rest of the way to Winston Salem,
stayed over, then gassed up in Greensboro on the way back: 23.2 mpg. I tried
to keep it at 55, but I caught myself at 60 again and again, and when I got to
gas up in Dunn ($2.11 hi test) my mileage showed it with only 19.6 mpg.
For those taking the trip to EveryBus on US 421, the lowest gas prices I saw
the whole time were in Dunn, but there were plenty of places to get fuel and
gas: Lillington, Dunn, and Sanford are probably best bets.
For now, however, the leaves were beautiful in their myriad of colors; the
kids counted the tons of cows in the sweeping roadside pastures; and the
cotton crops made some fields look like they were snow covered. It was a
wonderful trip, and being a Bus driver made it that much more enjoyable.
