Subject: RE: [T2] 75 FI wont idle after engine reinstall

Hi Greg,

I had a similar problem -- no idle when cold, high idle when hot -- and 
replaced the Temp Sensor II.  That's the one that bolts to the #3/4 head and 
hooks up to the FI wiring harness on the engine's left side (FIF).  It cost 
me $25 at my FLAPS and fixed the problems.

Good Luck!
