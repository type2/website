Subject: Re: [T2] a/c pulley

Richard,

York compressor on the drivers side with the pulley facing the front
of the bus.  Belt goes between the fan housing and the rest of the engine
to another pulley just behind the impeller.

Imagine a belt just above the moustache bar to the pulley on the crank 
behind the impeller.

All bus condensors that I have ever seen were under the belly.

VPC logos on the evaporator!?....Pictures please and I will pass them by 
my friend who was an engineer for VPC at the time...I've never heard of 
one like that either(or seen one).

Cheers, dave

thing is that the pulley is on the oil cooler side. The belt isn't hooked 
up and I can't figure out in my head how it would have been driven 
by the main pulley. Was it installed backwards?

The evaporator is under the jump seat behind the driver 
and there is a huge condenser under the body with two electric fans. 
There are VPC logos on the evaporator.
