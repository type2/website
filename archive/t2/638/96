I left that pulley bolt out (oops!) for a 10-12 hr drive from VA to TN. Only cost me a bit over a case of oil... 

Geez... Took a further $10 at the car wash to get the oil off ov the Hyundai I was towing... GREAT rust protection...

Beetle 2.0 Type IV towing a Hyundai... Upright conversion, didn't need the pulley...
