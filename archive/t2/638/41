I would think that the manifold vacuum would be affected by the rpm
at idle, and not by the timing settings. This is important to me
because I rarely see the famous 15 inches of vacuum on my vehicles.
Can you explain further?

With fuel injection, this is the way it makes sense to me, but it might 
not be the only or correct explanation.  As you retard your timing, as 
with a DVDA distributor, your idle speed will drop.  In order to 
maintain the correct idle speed you must open the idle speed adjustment 
screw which increases the amount of air going around your throttle 
plate (and increases the deflection of the vane in the air flow meter 
thereby increasing your idle speed).  As you bypass the throttle plate 
(which is closed at idle thereby creating vacuum in the manifold), you 
decrease the manifold vacuum.

For my stock '79 California bus with the DVDA distributor, the timing 
spec is 5 degrees ATDC at 850  RPM..  If I time it to this 
specification I will get 11 - 12 inches Hg at best.  If I advance 
timing 7.5 BTDC, then readjust idle to the specified 850 RPM, I will 
get 15 to 17 inches Hg.

Hope this helps
