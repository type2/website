I was just checking the bentley diagram. There should be a gray/black
wire coming from the ignition switch. This provides power to a circuit
(in this case the open door switch). Find this wire, attach a test
light btwn it and ground and insert the key. If all is well it should
light when the key is inserted. This is a great way to have the best
of all worlds :)
