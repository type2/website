Subject: Fun With Timing

Hi Folks,

A recent mention of ignition timing reminded me of some fun dynamic timing 
tidbits.  These only work if you have a light that you hook up when the 
ignition is on and the engine is running.  It also helps if you have a T4 
engine with the original timing scale in place:

1. For normal timing, hook the inductive lead up to Cyl. #1 -- this is the 
way you're "supposed" to time the engine.  The scale goes up to 40*, so you 
can get timing at idle and at total advance.

2. You can see where your other cylinders fire if you hook up your inductive 
lead to each one.  #1 and #3 will line up with the mark on the fan, and #2 
and #4 will be 180* off, but a bit of Liquid Paper or yellow paint (placed 
when the engine is OFF!) can help you find the spot.

2A. With marks both at 0* and 180*, you don't need to remove your 
distributor cap to set your valves.  Simply find where the #1 valves are at 
TDC, and go by the fan marks to set 2 thru 4.

3. If you hook up your inductive lead to the coil wire, you can time ALL 4 
cylinders at once!

4. A timing light also works really well at illuminating the distributor 
hold-down screw when it's dark in the engine compartment.

Sorry if these are obvious things, but I've been doing a lot of ignition 
timing recently and I wanted to share these fun tidbits.
