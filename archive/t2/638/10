> Is it turning over quickly or quite slowly? if slowly it might also be
 a good time to double check the connections at the starter and
 battery. Aside from the vacuum leak Bob suggested it could also be a
 double relay issue with the FI system. If the relay is not starting
 your fuel pump when the key is turned to the start position and the
 engine is turning slow enough to not open the AFM flapper the pump
 will not pump.

Its turning over normally, that is it sounds the same as it did before.
I couldnt detect any vacuum leaks with a visual inspection.

Is there anything else I can check at home?
