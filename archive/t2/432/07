Subject: re popping out of gear

My 70 Bus has started very infrequently popping out of gear in fourth. Usually
it's when I'm going slowly, I can drive hundreds of miles with no problem, but
sometimes going slowly it'll pop. I have a new coupler and other plans for the
trans, like new seals. Any ideas on the popping out? With the trans out, how
hard would it be to replace the associated parts?
