Subject: RE: [T2] Legal assistance in Cincinnati

For $3,000 i'd look into small claims court. Lawyer fees would probably be a
bit much otherwise. As long as you have hard-copy of the add and repair
bills, you should be able to get a judgement. Collecting that judgement from
a private citizen may be difficult though.

'77 Westy "Pumpkin II"


<SNIP>
Hello volks-
Had a bad time with a PO who rated the 78 Westy we bought as a #2 (needing
no mechanical work) on SAMBA. Our baby ended up needing over $3,000 worth of
work.
Without going into a lot of detail, the PO has stated he has no moral,
legal, or ethical responsibility for misrepresenting the bus. To top it off
the guy is an Associate minister.
Anyway, wanted to know if there were any listees who are or who know of a
good legal counsel in the Cinci, OH area. We've tried other types of
mediation to no avail.
