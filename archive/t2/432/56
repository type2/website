Pull / push the fan end, measure at the flexplate.

 ok, got the torque converter plate put on the engine and i was wanting to
 measure endplay but with the flex in the plate i don't feel i can get an
 accurate reading.  any guru advise out there.  what i did was put the shims
 from the old engine in the good engine and torqued her down to the bentley
 spec of 65 ft-lbs and then tried to flex back and forth on the plate then
 noticed the flex associated with such a thin piece of metal.
