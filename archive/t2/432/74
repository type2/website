Subject: Rust removal

I have spots of surface rust that I can sand down to bare metal...when I do
that some of it stays in the pitted areas and I cannot sand it out...if I
cover those areas with por15 will that be sufficient? Or does it really need
to removed completely? I am sanding with 100 grit paper...what else should I
use to get the rest of it out of the pitted areas? I am going to try some
marine clean tonight....

Thanks Volks,
Scott
