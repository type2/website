He must have gotten confused as the original post was a '71 with a Type 1.

I've had my engine out of my bus four times. Prior to that, I also removed the
engine in my Porsche 911 to replace the clutch. The two are very similar
except the Carerra 3.2l engine weighs a little more (grin) than the Type 4.
Also, the bus has a little more ground clearance than the 911 (still
grinning).

My #1 recommendation: have a friend come over who has done this before. Even
if all he does is hold the beer and call 911 if the engine falls on your arm,
it's by far the best thing you can do.

My #2 recommendation: cut about 12 pieces of 2x4 at about 16". Also keep two
2x4s that are at least 48".

My #3 recommendation: get two floor jacks. Preferably the kind with the long
handle and one-pump operation. But I've used just my K-Mart $15 special
before.

My #4 recommendation: get a cheap metal mechanics creeper. Again, a $15 K-Mart
special makes a great engine dolly. If you are really astute, you could buy
four nice big casters and use some more 2x4s to make a custom dolly.

My #5 recommendation: do this in a paved or concrete driveway. It sucks in
gravel. Ask me how I know...

You'll be surprised at how (relatively) easy the job is and gain a new sense
of confidence in yourself after you've had the engine out and back in (and
running).
