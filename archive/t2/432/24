Subject: Trying to find someone....

Does anyone know how to contact the owner of the Bus in the photo below?  I
think I have some parts he could use for his ambitious undertaking.  I
talked to him at HCBF, but never got any contact info.  I think he's in
Asheville somewhere.

Just e-mail me off the list and let me know.

Thanks,
Victor
