Seth,
Here is something to think about--and this product works excellent for
frame paint / undercoating---
Black urethane bed liner.
Bullet proof--excellent sound deading--as well as superior rust
prevention---and it don't come off--

It can be applied via spray can--or spray gun---
Morton mfg's the stuff--and I did all three of my VW's--3 years ago--and
it hasen't moved one iota--

inexpensive too---I think the spray cans are 16--or 20 oz.--and it's
3.99 a can--and it takes about 6 cans for the bottom and suspension
components.

Later,

Totally restoring my front axle and have sand blasted it and was going
to have it powder coated but then remembered a product I heard about
called Chassis Black from Eastwood and was wondering if anybody has used
this product and how pleased were they with the results?
