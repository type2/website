You do, because you have a 72-79 bus which had them in north america, 68-71 buses and all buses before them had the type1 engine, sometimes referred to as a type2 engine because it was installed in the bus.

Using this logic, you could also call the type4 engine installed in the type2 a type2 engine.

I like to stick with types 1 and 4.
