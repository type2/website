Yes it is.. But y'all need to read the literature or the website
www.por15.com there are tons of steps to making sure the rust doesn't come
right back...

From memory , but please check the site
Scrape off loose rust
Sand as well as you can
Treat rust with Ospho or similar product to convert the rust.
Then paint with POR15
then use one of their top coats as most paints won't stick to it
Then you can use any paint on top of that.

Hope this helps.

If applied correctly it will stop the rust and is hard as a rock.. You can
pound it with a hammer and it WON'T even chip the POR15

On Another note, wear gloves as POR15 WILL NOT wash off...With Anything...
IT has to wear off or take your skin off..  We had a DR friend that used it
and he had to work for a few days with the POR on his hands and had to
explain to his patients what it was.
