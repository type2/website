Subject: Re: [T2] re popping out of gear

sounds like the sequencers are going out .., when they finally go the tranny will have to be completely rebuilt.,
if they go out youll not find a gear at all..,,.
mine started in high gear and then went down the gears a little at a time.,.., when tranny finally went out i had a little of 1st and reverse,.,,.
nothing else.,,
was awful,,,
not saying this is your problem but popping out of gear like that can be caused can be i said caused by the sequencers going bad.,,.
hope this helps some?>
peace
