 the starters between a 79 Auto tranny and a manual

 Is it possible to put a starter from a late bay auto
 into a late bay manual??

No, the auto trans starter will not work on a 76-79
228mm flywheel.

It will work on a 72-73 210mm flywheel and a 74-75
215mm flywheel. It will not reach the teeth on the 228.
