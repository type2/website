I'm not sure if the electronic ignition you're talking about is VW's version
(don't even know if electronic ignition was available on the '76's) but, if
so, then you have to time the vehicle with the idle control stabilizer
disconnected.  The idle stabilizer does its job by changing the ignition
timing so if you point a timing gun at an idling engine that has the idle
stabilizer connected you'll see the timing jumping all over the place.  If
the electronic ignition is something you've added to what used to be a
point/condenser setup, then I don't know; my guess would be "worn
distributor" and that if you went back to points you'd see the same thing.
The AFM shouldn't have anything to do with it.
