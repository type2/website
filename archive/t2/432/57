Subject: Re: [T2] automatic crank endplay ?

IMHO, I would, for the purpose of measuring the endplay, push/pull on the
pulley end of the crank and measure at the flexplate end of the crank. If
you are using a dial indicator for measurement, the measuring force of the
indicator will not flex the plate appreciably.
    Not sure if this was exactly what you are after or not. Hope it helps-
