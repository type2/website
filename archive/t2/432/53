Subject: automatic crank endplay ?

ok, got the torque converter plate put on the engine and i was wanting to
measure endplay but with the flex in the plate i don't feel i can get an
accurate reading.  any guru advise out there.  what i did was put the shims
from the old engine in the good engine and torqued her down to the bentley
spec of 65 ft-lbs and then tried to flex back and forth on the plate then
noticed the flex associated with such a thin piece of metal.
