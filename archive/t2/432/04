Subject: Parting out '72 Westy in CT

    I have a '72 westy that I am preparing for the junk yard. The bus had a
front end collision that was not worth repairing. The camper interior was
removed by the P.O.
    Anyway, All of the glass is good (less the windshield), I am keeping the
engine and trans for myself. If you have any specific needs, drop me a line, I
am hoping to get everything off in the next couple of weeks so if you need
anything, let me know as soon as possible. Thanks-Jeff
