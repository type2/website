Subject: Re: pulling an upright engine

I pulled my 71 engine many times back in the early 70's to do 2 rebuilds
and find a &(-at-)^#(-at-)%$ oil leak that turned out to be a crack hidden behind
the flywheel.  I did this alone and I only weighed 130 lbs then! Given a
solid substrate like blacktop or concrete, all I needed was 2 scissor
jacks, a ply board about 2x3 feet, 3-4 pieces of 2 ft broom handle, a
small sledge, and a pry bar.  Also, a means of holding the trans, a 12"
concrete block with some extra wood on top- you do not need to wire up
the trans, just stop it from hanging only on the cv's.  I drove the rear
wheels onto about 4-5" of nailed together 2x8 boards to form a small
ramp.  If you cannot drive it, jack up the rear wheels on each side and
insert the ramps.   The scissor jacks contact either side of the sump
plate and stand on the board which rests on the broom handle sticks. The
secret was to lower the engine/trans until it was level to the ground
and resting on the block shim for the trans, allowing easier access to
the 2 upper nuts of the mounting bolts.  Both jack handles can be turned
at once to lower/raise the engine. Long box wrenches are good for this;
you can tap them with the small sledge.  With the rear apron removed, it
is easy to pull the engine back, as it stays parallel to the ground as
it rolls.  Reinstalling is easy, pry up the board and insert the broom
handle dowels. To get the scissor jacks under the engine, just collapse
them and pull up oner side of the engine- when alone I used pieces of
2x4's to stack under the heater box and a long 2x4 (6 ft min) to pry on
a fulcrum to raise the other side and kick the jack in place. The sledge
allows fine tuning of direction of the board as it is rolled in place. 
Make sure the acc. cable is started into the tube running through the
air housing. Once the lower trans studs lined up with the case holes, I
laid underneath and tapped the board until the studs started in the
holes, and then tapped, pushed, wiggled from the rear while wrenching
the crankshaft side to side..  Clutch disk centering is critical to let
the transhaft slide in.
    The pancake engine is too heavy for the scissor jacks, and I use a
hydraulic jack.  I just got the Sears Motorcycle jack, on sale for $89
that lowers a platform that is more stable than a hyd. jack.
