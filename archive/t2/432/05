Subject: Anyone know the part #?

Anyone know the Part number for the gasket to the nosecone of a 79 tranny? I
had to open mine up to check the shift selector and I need a new one, but
only see whole kits advertised. This is the gasket that goes between the
nosecone cover and the rest of the tranny.

Thanks
