Subject: RE: [T2] rebuild

Is 200,000+ miles all that unusual?
I still have the original motor in the bus that used to be my
fathers, and it was very close to 300,000 before it threw a rod.
It's been rebuilt since, but it always used to just keep going and
going.

Dad was a fanatic about regular maintenance though and always had it
tuned.  He was in the Coast Guard when I was growing up, so when the
gov't transferred us to a new base we always drove.  That bus hauled
our whole family to Alaska and back, on the full length of the
AlCan, 4 times, and from the western U.S. to the eastern U.S. twice,
and that was on top of also being used as a daily commuter/kiddie
hauler for my sister and I, and vacations and such when we could
take them.

Never knocked, always had plenty of power.  I grew up thinking that
that was just VW's in general.  Only now that I am older am I
starting to get the idea that maybe not all VW's last that long.

He never did anything more than change the oil, adjust the valves,
basic tune up stuff really (points, plugs, dist, rotor, cap, hoses,
cables, the usual).  In fact I think the bus only really cost us
when we had to replace the exhaust every couple of years.  He didn't
do anything magical to the bus or have any super secret treatment
that he used to keep it running any better than any other bus on the
road in the 70's.  The bus still runs on it's original heater boxes
which are still fully functional and without rusty holes or exhaust
leaks.

God I love that bus...
