Subject: Re: [T2] I'm gonna pull my engine

Hello,

I pulled my engine may times in the last year alone.  It is a 73, pancake.
It is a type two, not identical to the type 4.  It is not so difficult and I
have done it alone although I always fetched help to put it back.

Personally I think it is more convenient to take the engine out WITH the
trany,  particularly when it comes time to put it back.  But it can easily
be done both ways.

Just my opinion.
Andrea
