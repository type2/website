The buslab in Berkeley is GRRRRREAT!

I have to second Roland's suggestion of Fred's down in Redwood City. I
have used them quite a few times now actually, and they have always done
amazing work. The friends I have sent them have all had the same
experiences. The only down side is the long drive, but call in advance,
let them know when you come in that you will be waiting for it, and you
can usually get a deal where if you show up the minute the open, they
will take care of you first.

Tassi is Daly City. These guys know their stuff, but are usually pretty
busy, so give them a call and see how backed up they are first.

also, I DO know of a smog place that is both bus friendly and willing to
try running your bus first without sending the data to the DMV in the
process. The best part is that they don't charge you until you can pass
and they actually print up a certificate for you. The sad thing is I
know its in South San Francisco, but I don't remember the name of the
place or the South San Francisco exit you take to get there, but I will
check it out tomorrow on my way to work and write you back with that
information.
