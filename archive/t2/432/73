Subject: RMMW show this Sat.

The RMMW show is this Sat 8/9....is there anyone planning to go that needs a 
place to camp/eat/shower, etc?  Teller County currently has an open fire 
ban, so if you are camping anywhere in the county be sure to check 
restrictions.  The county website is www.co.teller.co.us
