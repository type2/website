Subject: '72 wiper arms . . .redux

Joel, thanks for the offer.

I did buy a pair of '72 arms that were NOS, and another that were off a '72 
bus.  Both sets seemed to be painted silver.

I really thought they were chrome.


And I have a few pair of black late bay arms, and a couple of pair of 
Merceded Benz stainless steel wiper arms, with 16" stainless steel wiper 
blades that I am going to try to refit to the '72.


I guess the '72 is not going to be original, with all the stainless steel 
wiper stuff (illegal after some undetermined date, due to the govt not 
wanting shiny objects on the windshield.)
