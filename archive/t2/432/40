Subject: vacuum advance

How can you test a vacuum canister? 

Isn't there some rule about being able to blow into it or not or
something like that to know it the little bladder inside is still
working correctly or not? 

I tried hooking up this other distributor this evening to see if the one
I have been running is what is causing my timing mark to hop all over
the place when trying to time it, so I thought I would switch it back
over to points in the process, just to take the electronic ignition out
of the equation also, but I either have no idea how it went in there in
the first place, or this distributor isn't working somehow. 

I have new points and condenser on it, the wire from the distributor
goes to the negative side of the coil, I put the notch of the
distributor towards where the rotor is pointing when the engine is in
its top dead center position, but it just doesn't fire. I tried just
moving the distributor around to different locations in case it was just
too far off to fire, but no dice. 

In the morning, ill try to put the electronic ignition onto this same
distributor and see what happens. Maybe I can get it to fire then.

I have three distributors, the one that is really broken you can't blow
into the vacuum canister at all, the one I have been running with the
timing jumping all over the place you can sort of blow into a little and
hear the bladder or whatever is inside make a little soft sound as it
fills with air, or something like that, and the one I am trying to work
with now you can just blow freely into.  - One of these thing are doing
the right thing, can you tell me which one? 
=)

Thanks for listening, if you made it this far, you should probably win a
prize.
