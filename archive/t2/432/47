Subject: Re: Recommendation for mechanic in San Francisco Bay Area

Jason,
Rather than look for a good mechanic, I would look for a shop that does smog 
tests at a fair price. The new "enhanced" smog test II is just phasing in so 
there are shops charging $75 and more for the dyno. test, while others are 
still doing it the old-fashioned way for $25 or less. Check your newspapers 
for coupons, but always ask how much is the test Before the discount is 
deducted.
There are no speciatly VW shops listed in our regional Consumers' Checkbook 
that merit a check for both quality and price in the cities you inquired 
over. But Fred's Garage in Redwood City (416-D Industrial Way, 650-368-5343) 
did merit such an endorsement if you are willing to make the drive of about 
25 miles down the Peninsula. I haven't had my van there, but recall getting 
some valuable free advice from their tune-up specialist over the telephone, 
which is unusual. But try a low-priced smog test which may give you a "pass 
or don't pay" deal, and if you don't then go to Fred's, or write back to the 
list for advice after you have the stats on the levels and reasons for 
failure. Because you don't know about the van, ask them to do an "off-line" 
check to detect a possible "gross polluter" before you get trapped in the 
never-never land of the the State smog program computer system.
If it is any consolation, this should be your last smog test as the 
"30-years and out" law will exempt you in 2005!
Roland
