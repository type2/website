don't assume stainless steel is better. in fact, for almost everything on a
vehicle, common stainless fasteners are worse. most stainless fasteners are
too soft to be used for anything other than sheet metal fastening and the
like. for instance, anything structural, brake-related or otherwise
suspension related should always be attached with alloy steel fasteners in
the appropriate grade. most of the fasteners on a bus are grade 8.8, some
are grade 9.8 and others are grade 10.9.

here is an example of grades and strengths:

a fastener in AISI 304 (stainless steel) has a yield strength of about
30,000 psi. the same fastener in grade 8.8 alloy steel has a yield strength
of 92,000 psi, and a grade 10.9 fastener a yield strength of 120,000 psi. so
if you removed a grade 10.9 fastener from the suspension of your bus and
replaced it with a stainless one, you have likely just reduced the strength
of the assembly by a factor of 4x.

for more info, check the web:

echanical%20Properties%20for%20Steel%20Fasteners.htm

so if the strength of the fastener is critical, use alloy steel in the
correct grade. most fasteners are marked as to their grade, so if you remove
one you can check it and replace it with the same rating.
