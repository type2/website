   My gauge flips around as a result of the sloshing of the gas in the 
tank, but otherwise reads accurately.  If half full, it will frequently 
hit the 1/1 mark if I'm driving over high-amplitude terrain or 
otherwise rocking the bus (grin).
   Is this normal?  The gauge responding to sloshing fuel, I mean.  Or 
should there be some damping in the system, as with every other vehicle 
I've driven?  If there should be damping, is it in the gauge (my guess) 
and how would I go about restoring its function?  TIA
