Subject: RE: [T2] Chassis black

I am with you on the POR-15. I buy cans of it whenever I have a little extra
money. Worth every penny. I am just getting ready to coat the battery tray
area in the bus with it. The only thing you have to remember with the POR 15
is that the UV light will fade it, not a problem if you pick up a can of
Chassis black coat from POR 15 to cover it.

more than any possibility that some sun on the beam may fade it a little."
