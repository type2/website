Subject: 17 mm bolt

Hello All,
I am in need of some bolts to hang my bumpers on a 1960 double cab.  I had
some that are seemingly the right diameter, a 17mm head, but the threads are
not correct.
Where would be a good place to shop for such a size bolt?
If the head is a 17mm, how do I size the bolt?  A 17 mm???
Beep Beep,
