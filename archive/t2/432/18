Subject: what a difference a starter makes

First let me say that replacing the starter was probably one of the easiest 
repairs ive ever
done to my bus.

Its a 76, so I took out the AFM and had to move a few hoses to get at the 
nut holding it from the inside of the engine compartment out, but once that 
was done, it was a breeze.

And now that I have a new (rebuilt, the bosch something 87 one they had on 
BD also) one installed, wow, what a difference. It just cranks it so nice 
and quickly that it fires almost the second I try to get it going. Just turn 
the key and whammo, its running.

Between the electronic ignition and now the new starter, it fires up just 
like that.

Of course, I still have to figure out why when im timing it, the notch is 
hopping around like a freakin
rabbit, but I have another Dist im going to try out to see if its the Dist 
shaft on the one im currently using. Maybe go back to points and see what 
happens, and if that fails to show results also, try the other AFM.

weee.
