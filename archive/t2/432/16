Yup, G is a `77.  But typically the engine is not the original.  It's still
a pancake, with a single Weber (I know, I know).

I'm going to rig the driveway for the pull, and work out how to safely drop
it on my own.  The trick may be my figuring out which specific seal to get,
though it will simplify replacing the plugs, wires & other general tune-up
bits...
