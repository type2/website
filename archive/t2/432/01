I'm contemplating pulling my first bus engine in over 20 years, and I'm
fairly certain that I can pull it without too much problem.  My question is
about the engine seal that I have to replace because of that leak.

The cost to have this done my mech may be too much for my budget, and the
leak has gotten bad enough to affect the shifting to the point where hills
are almost beyond the bus' capacity to navigate.  I can't wait until
September to get the work done, and while I'd love to have a certified mech
go over the engine, I need to keep the white-on-red darling on the road.

(... and I DO need to refamiliarize myself with the drive train...)

Any advice on how to make this as painless as possible?  Tools?
Finger-savers?  Choice of non-alcoholic beverage?
