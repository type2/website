Subject: Recommendation for mechanic in San Francisco Bay Area

Folks...

I'm looking for a recommendation for a good VW mechanic in the
San Francisco Bay Area, preferably in San Francisco, Berkeley,
or Oakland.

My immediate need is that I am buying a '76 Westy, and I am going to
need to get it smog'd in order to transfer title (this must be a new
requirement in CA; I don't remember having to do this the last time I
sold a car, about 4 years ago.. and, yes, I know that the rule says
this is the seller's responsibility, but the seller is a friend who's
moving out of state so I offered to do the leg-work).

Thanks!
