Subject: Re: [T2] Rust removal (POR)

I'm doing some surface rust removal (Thankfully thats all I've got) and 
I had a similar thought (paint over rust), but it got me thinking that 
it would work even better if there wasn't any rust and it just 
prevented future rust. Is this the case ?

I am sanding the undercarriage of my 73 Safare (brushing, busting 
knuckles and cursing too)  with the end goal being to undercoat it, I 
had planned on sanding all the rust off, POR'ing it and using the POR 
primer then undercoating it. From what I can figure the POR seems to be 
"the answer" to keeping a bus together.
Any testimonials ? Any ideas for undercoating ?

Steve
