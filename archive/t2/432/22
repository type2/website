Subject: Vacuum line question?

I am reinstalling my engine in my 77 bay.  It has been sitting on the 
shop floor for three years.

My question, where does the EEC (evaporative emissions control) 
cutoff valve get its vacuum from.  This is the small nipple on the 
side of the air cleaner.  Figure 1.1 of the Fuel Injection section of 
Bentley shows all the other vacuum sources and devices as does page 
71 of the owners manual.  I can't find a schematic of the EEC system 
anywhere.  Any help?

I can see two main sources of vacuum on the engine, i.e., the 
throttle valve and the intake air distributor ports.  Which of these 
two (if those) controls the EEC cutoff valve?

Thanks,
