Um... I thought that I had a T4 engine, in a T2?  Pancake?

You do have a type4 engine but the man, boy, girl, person that started the
thread (if I am not mistaken) had a 1970 type 2 which has a type 1 motor in
it. Your engine (type4) is alot more difficult to pull. I have never owned
anything past a 1968 so I don't have any personal experience pulling a
"pancake" engine just read about them in a Bentley.
