Subject: Will Headliner from 72 Fit a 79?

Jeff from this list is parting out his 72 Westy before it goes to the
junkyard, and I was wondering if his headliner would fit my 79 Westy? I'm
thinking it won't because of the pop top issue (rear or front opening).
Anyone know if it'll fit? Mine is long gone, was home to a lovely family of
mice and was the nastiest thing I ever removed from a junker car I've
restored.
