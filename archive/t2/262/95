Subject: 75 FI bus won't start

In the process of rejuvenating the 75 bus (sat since 1997) I established
the fuel pump was bad (clicked, did not run), and drained the tank and
changed the filter and pump.  Broken wire on cyl. temp sendor was fixed;
resistance was around 500 at 72 degr.  Plugs OK (looked rich, previous
starts of engine did work but put out black smoke- assume it was bad
temp sendor).  Attached a line to the fuel rail T and it easily pumped
out a cup of gas in a few seconds.
Dwell and timing are on, fine spark when plug wire is held near ground
and strobe but it wouldn't start; ignition is fine as it will run for 2
seconds with a squirt of ether.  I overdid this and got a backfire that
bent the AFM flap and blew 2 hoses off the s-tube.  Luckily I had 2
extra and put one on, so that's been changed.  Put a fuel pressure gauge
onto the T and it is reading 40 max during cranking, so I assume
pressure regulator is OK.  Checked the voltage to the cold start valve;
it's there and diminishes in 5 seconds-OK.  Put a test light on the
injector plugs and they are NOT getting power.  No smell of gas at
exhaust after much cranking.  Checked the center prong on the series
resistor plug and that has juice.  Tried another double relay, NaDa. 
Checked terminal one on the MPC and it has power- means coil trigger
wire is continuous and OK?.  Checked terminal 10 to 5, 17, 18 and there
is continuity so "brain" has ground.  The AFM checked out (oops, I
didn't check the swapped one).  Swapped out the brain, and still no
start!!!!!   So what am I missing?
