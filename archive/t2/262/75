Hello,

Thanks for the replies. I am not sure what the sensor
goes to. I assumes that it went with the f.i. but I am
not sure. I will just go ahead and order the correct
Bosch replacement part. I was hoping that all these
sensors would be similar enough to be interchangable.
Oh well, Thanks again for the advice!
