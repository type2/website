Or maybe a water to liquid cooler with a radiator mounted under the bus
or something like that. There are a million possibilities, but the
problem that is going to remain is that the engine ultimatly wasn't
designed to be turbo. As much as I would like to make one that is
reliable and is turbo charged.

Hey Now! If you want more from that doghouse, many around here take a
type 4 
oil cooler and put it in. Sure the doghouse now must get bigger, and
thats 
not a problem, take it to a welder, make your fan shroud bigger. I am
going 
to do this soon....
