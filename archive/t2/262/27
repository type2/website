Subject: Re: [T2] Shift Pattern Drawing

Hi Rogelio,

It's a common sight that the shift pattern has faded away.

However, someone made a photoshopT document of it (.psd document)

If you use transparent sticker foil in your printer and print it onto that
you can re-apply it to the ashtray.

The page is in Dutch language but i have given the translation already here.

The direct link to the .psd document containing the shift pattern is here.

Good luck with the printing!!
