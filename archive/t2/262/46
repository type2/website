Great for the oil, but this doesn't help the cylinder heads.  If the
cylinder heads are going to transfer more heat to the oil they have to run
hotter, which isn't exactly our goal.

Also, a larger type IV cooler will take more air from the shroud, which
won't go to cooling the heads.  When VW went to the doghouse, they also
installed a larger fan to provide the added airflow

That being said, I think that the type IV cooler is the most elegant
solution to added oil heat load in high HP engines.  I'd like to see an
instrumented comparison between the type IV and the close fin type III
coolers, though
