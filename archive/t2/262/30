Subject: smelling gas

I have a '79 bus with an '75 1800 engine in it.  The 1800 has a Weber 
Progressive on it - installed by PO.

I park the bus the garage.  In the mornings, or anytime it sits for a 
while inside the garage, I smell gas.  I have been over the fuel lines 
and found no leaks.  Based on what I've read here I purchased new VW 
fuel lines and replaced the ones one the bus.  Still get the gas smell.

I've had two suggestion as to the cause; 1) the Weber is leaking fuel 
after the engine is shut off , or 2) the breather valve on the gas tank 
is stuck open and get the fumes that way.

What do you all think?  Any of these sound right or have any other 
suggestions.

Thanks for your help.
