Subject: Re: [T2] Pilot Bear WILL NOT COME OUT

[...]

I had one like that. If I remember the size, I got a 5/8" fine thread bolt and
screwed it into the bearing shell. It bottomed out in the crank and I keep
turning it and the shell followed the threads out the crank. I think I had to
grind the 1st couple of threads to get it started.
