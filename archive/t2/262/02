Subject: Going back to dual Solex's

Guys and Gals.

I have been thinking of converting my single Weber Progressive back to a dual
Solex 34 pdsit. I have had one friend say it will GREATLY improve performance
(a guy who has run single Webers, dual Carbs and FI on 914's) and another
friend who says it won't matter that much (a guy who has run buses both type 4
and 1600 style, Bajas and Vanagons). Any thoughts?

 Since all of my stock aircleaner and everything else was thrown away when a
PO did the Weber conversion, what should I look to buy? Should I try to put a
stock air cleaner back in or what? And what should I do with the oil bath tube
if I don't put the stock air cleaner in? (I live in an area which will not
require vehicles older than 20 years to have emission tests.)

Thanks!
