I just recently went back to dual solex 32-34 PDSIT's on my 74 single
cab and I still can't get over the difference.  Beautiful cold starts,
perfect idles (cold and warm) smoooooooth acceleration.  It took a while
collecting all the parts needed but in my opinion, well worth it.  BTW,
I switched from dual 34 Weber ICT's because I could never get them
jetted right, they were difficult to adjust (to me), didn't run
smoothly, I'm familiar with the stock ones, and the engine just looks
purtier with the stock setup on it!  Greg
