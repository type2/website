Subject: RE: [T2] key off.. still runnin..

Do you have fuel cutoff solenoids on your carbs? If not then this is
normal from what I hear. They look like  a round cylinder about an inch
long, and the size around of a quarter or of a dime, ive seen them in
both sizes, and then have a wire going to them from the coil. Chances
are you don't have them, because normally they fail closed and you
wouldn't be getting the bus running. The other thing that comes to mind
might be that the ignition isnt cutting of immediately, an it is letting
the coil spark for a few seconds more.

if the engine doesnt want to stop when the key is turned off what is the

first place to look... in other words it sounds like its gonna stop
runnin , 
but it tries to get a couple extra sparks, and then cuts out... not back

firing.
