Subject: Source for oil pressure regulator valve

My oil cooler appears to have blown as oil is coming out all over the

caused by a faulty oil pressure relief valve?  Anybody suggest a
known source for a new relief valve? 

Hey there David,

It might be the oil cooler seals that have finally let go (AMHIK). If
the oil drips down the oil filter (that general area), it could be
the oil cooler seals OR it could be the oil pressure switch (behind
the distributor, which is directly above the oil cooler). 

Check the oil pressure switch ('cause its easier to fix), but my
guess is that the PO blew the oil cooler seals 'cause he was running
"heavy" oil in the winter. Northeasterners will usually run a lighter
"winter blend" of oil to avoid high oil pressure problems on cold
winter mornings.

Hope this helps,
