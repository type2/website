Subject: Weber progressive jet sizes

Anyone know the correct size jet for a Weber progressive 2 barrel on a 2L?
I had this carb on my 1800 and she ran well but not so well on this 2L.
Trying to leave for Indigebus...
http://www.fullmoonbusclub.net/Indigibus.html Please help...  The idle
problem is better, she popped one time and then ran fine but stutters on
acceleration.
