> Sounds like that header might be warped and not
pulling up to the head, the longer you run it, the
bigger chance you have of trenching the head, take the
header off and inspect the head to make sure it is not
damaged. Try another header with a new gasket and see
if it will seal. If it has trenched the head you might
try JB weld to seal the cut. Phil
