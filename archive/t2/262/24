Subject: Copper spray on brake pads

I picked up the Sept issue of the UK VW mag, VolksWorld, and it had a good
brake article for a 79 bus.

Step #12 demonstrated spray the backs of the brake pads with anti-seize
copper spray lube before installation.

Does anyone do this as a regular habit?

Does it make it a lot easier to put in new pads with a new rotors?
