Subject: Re: [T2] Going back to dual Solex's

On the subject of dual vs. single carbs on a T4, IMHO, the duals are
preferred. This is location-sensetive, tho.  Here in VA, the singles have
a bad habit of icing in the long runner tubes.  The duals, with their
short stacks don't.  IN AZ or CA, this would not be the issue it is here,
but that's my story and I'm sticking to it :-)
