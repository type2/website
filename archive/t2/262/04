Subject: Oil out of Exhaust Manifold

Been wondering about a rather large oil leak under the passanger side area around the valve covers. It's not really the valve gaskets or the push rod tubes but a lot of oil falling from the small holes in the exhaust manifold on that side. Where is the oil coming from? Last time I checked I had good rings/compression there. Laura :o(
