Subject: Re: [T2] Need exhaust manifold advice

[...]

3 things can be bad [I have seen the ones I listed, there may be more]:

1) copper seal ring, either missing or burned out or half cocked in the hole.

2) flange on end of manifold, either warped and not sealing to the copper ring
or the tack welds broke and the iron flange is no longer swedged to the
stainless steel pipe.

3) the cylinder head has a chunk of aluminum missing where the copper seal
ring sits, usually where one of the studs enter the head.....

Remove the exhaust pipe and look at all these places. I would drop the U
pipe/exhaust header in one piece. 4 tin screws holds the lower tin, 4 nuts
hold the manifold to the head, and 3 nuts and bolts on the end of the U pipe
where it bolts to the box. I find it easier then trying to remove the manifold
at the U in the bus. Use plenty of penetrating oil, like Liquid Wrench, NOT
WD-40.
