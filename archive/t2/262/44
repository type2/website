Subject: Cool tin and '79 owner's manual

Hi Volks... Anyone have a set of VW cool tin they would like to sell or
trade? Also, I found an owner's manual for a '79 bus that anyone who needs
one can have. First come , first served.... TBear

Don't take life to seriously- you'll never live though it...
