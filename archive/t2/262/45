The purpose of any torque pattern is to reduce assymetrical stresses on
the parts and to assure that all of the cylinder studs are given the same
torque in the end.

You could simply snug all the studs in any order in increments of 1 ft-lb
and achieve this goal.  However, this would involve 288 torque
measurements per engine, just for the heads.  The Muir and bentley
patterns allow you to shortcut this process to only 32 torque
measurements and still not overtighten or undertightne any stud.  The Berg
method kind of splits the difference.

As a perfectionist I would use the Muir patterns and tighen in more
increments (probably 2 or 3 ft-lbs at a time.)  The other patterns should
work just fine as well.  Just remember not to overtighten!
