Subject: Front brake questions

I've still got few worries with the front brakes...

For the rotated piston I have it appears the one of the dust seals has torn
in the process:

1) what should I do about this? How can I rotate the piston into position?

Should it rotate freely when it's lubricated with brake paste?

The other problem:

I noticed that the spreading spring and retaining pins are both very rusty.
I just read over the whole brake chapter in Bentley again and it says the
the pins need to be smooth so the spring can slide on it.

2) Are these items best found separately or is there a front brake kit that
contains the items I need? I can see the separate part numbers in ETKA so
I'm hoping they are still available.

Does anyone know what's contained in this kit: 251-698-615
