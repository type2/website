Subject: key off.. still runnin..

if the engine doesnt want to stop when the key is turned off what is the 
first place to look... in other words it sounds like its gonna stop runnin , 
but it tries to get a couple extra sparks, and then cuts out... not back 
firing.  i am guessing timing or carbs?  thanks for the help  .. scott 71 
vesty.. 1641 (recent rebuild) . dual 34mm solex . full flow oil sys. and 
single quiet pack. .. the bus runs great no skippin or missin just doesnt 
want to totally shut off.
