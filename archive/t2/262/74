David,

I havent worked with a 914 2L, but if it is fuel injected that sensor is
important for the injection. It controlls the warmup encrichment and so
on. Personally I would get the correct part and not one that Just looks
correct. Then again this is just my $.02.

Hello list,

I believe my head temperature sensor on my 914 2L
needs to be replaced. It is really loose in its base
and I don't want to have to remove the engine tin
later to replace it. This is the small sensor that
screws on top of the left head. It has one wire that
comes out the center. My question is, does it really
matter what brand it is? I found one in the Bus depot
for about $23, one in Pelican Parts for about $26. I
called my local Flaps and they said they had the same
part for $6.
