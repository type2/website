Subject: Re: [T2] Going back to dual Solex's 

I love my dual solexs, only thing i wish i could change is the linkage, id 
rather have the hex bar linkage rather than the -whatcha ma callit- ball and 
joint linkage. but the ball and joint work great, just a bit tougher to 
adjust... but still not hard .. peace .. scott 71 vesty
