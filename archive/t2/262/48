Subject: Backing plate problem with front caliper

I almost finished with my brakes today following list advice, Mr. Dolan, and
the Volksworld bus brakes article I mentioned earlier and I'm really happy
with the results so far. Copper anti-seize lube on the adjustment screws
almost makes up for all my drum brakes cursing in the past.

I replaced all 4 hoses and the pulsing I was experiencing in the pedal is
now gone.  I bleed some more crud out of the system and the pedal travel is
perfect.

One problem remains however: all 4 of my backing plates had the tabs
flattened so I remedied this but one of the pistons in one of the calipers
has rotated and I can't fit the backing plate with the tabs protruding.

Bentley mentions special pliers to rotate the piston but I don9t have this.
How can I rotate the piston?  I tried to rotate it with the tools I had but
it won't budge and I need to rotate it about a centimeter.

It's rotated in the direction Bentley indicates so I didn't think I could
pop out one tab and wait for it to catch.
