Subject: Shift Pattern Drawing

 Hi,

Does anyone has the shifter pattern drawing that goes on 
the ashtray of the bus. After 34 years, mine faded away, 
and I thought that I could draw it and print a stencil to 
paint it on the ashtray. 

I know there is a decal out there, but I'll probably end 
up paying more for shipping than for the decal.
  
Reason I'm looking for the pattern is that my brother 
told me the other day that he just realized where the 
reverse was. He didn't know it was down and to the left 
of 2nd gear. He thought it was to the right of 4th gear. 
Good thing he didn't borrow the bus in the past two 
years!

Thanks a lot,

Rogelio
