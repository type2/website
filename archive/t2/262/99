MPC?  What is that?
The coil trigger wire comes from the #1 terminal of the coil. It should pulse
voltage when the points open and close. The injecters do not run continously,
they open when the points open. Terminal 1 on the ECU. It is a long single
white wire exiting the EFI harness about 6" from the ECU plug.
