Subject: 3rd tail light

<<Since I haven't gotten the headliner back in yet, I
figure that this is 
the best time to do it so i can run the wire for it
inside the roof 
line
up to the fuse box.>>

-- The 3rd tailight (my experience) will come with a
wire to run to each tail light and a grnd. I spliced
in
to the brake light ckt right at the brake light(s)
connector and ran the wire(s) up the air intake vent.
Up high I drilled a hole and ran the wires through
and fished it under the headliner as it was pushed
from the outside.(rubber grommet insert used)
I ran the wires into the openings where the hinge
assembly goes on the back hatch door. the light is
mounted at the bottom of the window. (mine is hinged
so i can flop it out of the way of the curtain).
