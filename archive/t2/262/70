Ive never had a leak in the middle ofthe tube only at
the connections.

The ones at the cylinder are very easy top is the fill
and bottom is the outlet.

What I do is just cut the buldged tube off, and remake
the connection.  Is really easy and really fast!  Ive
never had to replace all the tubing!
