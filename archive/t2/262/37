Subject: $100 bus in Rockford,IL

$100 bus in Rockford,IL 72 bus with no engine or trans has some interior 
items. The body is not bad on it. Glass is all good. I needed to sell it last 
year now I really need to sell it. I have many parts for this that can be 
sold with the bus to help get the bus back on the road. I also have many 
other aircooled parts that I will sell also. E-mail with part needs or more 
info on the bus. Bus needs to be moved ASAP. Thanks

Dan
