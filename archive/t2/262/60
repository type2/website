IF I adjust the screw I have been moving (maybe it's the wrong one) I can
get it to idle fine but it will cut out and not restart.  If I adjust it
just a tad it idles soooo loud I am afraid I am going to blow the engine.
Maybe I am not gettign full throttle with the new accelerator cable.  And
the Weber being miss tuned just isn't helping matters

Thanks for the advise.  I will try and check the float in the am.  I sprayed
some wd40 type stuff (extinguisher in hand) to look for intake leaks.  There
were none.

Peace Brother,
