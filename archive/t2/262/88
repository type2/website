Subject: Pilot Bear WILL NOT COME OUT

My pilot bearing absolutely positively will not come
out.  It was so destroyed when I first got to it the
bearings were sitting in a pile.  I rented a pilot
bearing puller(2 prong) and it just slips off or bends
the edges.  I have now commenced cutting a line
through the middle of it and it still wont come out. 
It is even hard to distinguish between the pilot
bearing and crankshaft metal.  Have these things been
melted together, is that even possible. Anyone have
any ideas.  thanks
