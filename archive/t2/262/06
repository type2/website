Guys and Gals.

I have been thinking of converting my single Weber Progressive back to a dual
Solex 34 pdsit. Any thoughts?

I am doing the same thing. I hate my weber progressive. I've heard good things about the solexes w/ kadron. Once I get time from school, my van back from the body man, another head, etc, I'm going to make the conversion. I am getting 40's. I guess this was more moral support than anything.                                                    -Paul Deatherage
