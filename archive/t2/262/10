Subject: Re: [T2] Going back to dual Solex's

Dual Kadron's are excellent carbs. Look for a used set on www.thesamba.com
or other VW trade boards. These carbs are just 40mm versions of original
solexes made in Brazil. I have used these carbs since the mid 70's and can
say nothing but good things about them. In fact, I would take those carbs
over the original factory setup any day.
