Subject: Eberspacher BN4 Heater

Hello all,
I have a NOS BN4 heater for sale.  Has no ductwork, control cable or switch.  
I do have photocopies of repair manuals, troubleshooting, installation and 
other info.
You can use a defroster switch to turn it on and off and a grass cutter cable 
will work for adjusting the heat.  Ductwork can be fabricated.
I'm asking $250 plus shipping which would be around $15 to anywhere in the 
continental USA.  
Get a heater for your bus before the snow starts to fly and stay warm.
