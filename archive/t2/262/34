I doubt that any of the newer watercooled Veedub alternators will fit,
although I could be wrong about that.

I found an old, larger 70-amp Type IV alternator in a box at my local VW
fix-it garage. It seems like it cost about $125 to completely rebuild it at a
local auto electrical shop. I also replaced the voltage regulator with a
larger one rated for the 70-amp alternator, although I'm not sure that it was
necessary.

I was wondering if any of the newer VW alternators
will work on the type 4 engines.  I would like
something that will through allot of amps and I
thought maybe an 80's VW with A/C may have something
half decent.  I found a 70 amp alternator at cip but I
was hopping for something I could look for at a
wreckers.

Thanks,
