This is really necessary in order to get the tubes re-installed properly.  I
used this opportunity to clean the deflection plates which were grimy from
oil leaks.

This is what a pushrod tube leak looks like:

Just remove the filter?

I think all GE engines and GD 011000-GD 055800 engines use the same egr
config: the filter bolts at the egr port on your exhuast and again at the
engine tin where it shares a set of bolts for the pipe that goes all the way
to the egr valve at the throttle body.
