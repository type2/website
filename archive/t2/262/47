Subject: Heater Video

Hi Volks,

Anyone have one of those "How-to" videos on Eberspacher BN-4 repair?  I 
have a friend who's trying to refub a heater for his bus this winter 
and he's having trouble getting it sorted.  I've seen the Raby T4 
engine video and wouldn't dream of an engine rebuild without it. So the 
heater video would probably be a good idea for my pal. It's not me; my 
bus is going into hibernation sometime after Halloween.

Tell me how much you want for it and I'll tell you where to ship it.

Thanks!


Happy trails,
