Subject: washer resevoir time release!!!!

Good morning all,
 
  Got a question for a funny situation on my 71. 
 
Tonight I pumped up my washer bottle to 20 psi
 
 and around 3 hours later I was drinking a few 
 
with the neighbor and all of a sudden I heard a 
 
hissing sound and here comes all the washer 
 
water all over the drive way. Leaks look like they
 
 are coming from just behind the bumper where 
 
the lines go into the front face of the bus. Any one 
 
ever heard of such crazy crap?? Why the time
 
 release and all of the fluid at once???? Please
 
 help me believe I'm not loosing my mind!!!!!
 
Thanks,
