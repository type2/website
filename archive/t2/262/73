Subject: Head temperature sensor headache

Hello list,

I believe my head temperature sensor on my 914 2L
needs to be replaced. It is really loose in its base
and I don't want to have to remove the engine tin
later to replace it. This is the small sensor that
screws on top of the left head. It has one wire that
comes out the center. My question is, does it really
matter what brand it is? I found one in the Bus depot
for about $23, one in Pelican Parts for about $26. I
called my local Flaps and they said they had the same
part for $6. They guy swore up and down that it was
not an important sensor and only turned on the cooling
fan! I found that alittle hard to swallow considering
that the cooling fan is attached the the crank shaft.
If this $6 sensor looks identical to the sensor that
is already in the head, would it be safe to go ahead
and buy it? any experience with this? Thanks!
