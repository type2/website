Subject: Re: [T2] Pilot Bear WILL NOT COME OUT

Faced with the same situation, I contemplated taking it to a machine shop to
be drilled out.  Since I ended up getting the motor rebuilt at AVP, I just
let them clean it out.  If you a new pilot bearing on hand you might be able
to measure the OD and use a slightly small bit to drill it out yourself,
CAREFULLY...
