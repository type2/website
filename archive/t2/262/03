Subject: Re: [T2] Going back to dual Solex's

I don't think you'll see any performance improvement myself, but you might
see a bit of gas mileage improvement. I tend to favor the stock setups
anyway, and if it was up to me, it would be fuel injected from a later bus.
But the dual solexes once the synchronization is done are pretty darn
reliable. Make sure the throttle plate shafts are not worn out. Other than
that, have fun!
