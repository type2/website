Subject: Update: Bad Valve Issues/Question, Opinion sought.

Hi All:

Thanks all for the good advice. I decided to take the car back and experiment
myself. After looking over the shops work I am glad that I did not have them
do anything major.

I repeated their quick test of removing each plug from the distributor cap.
Removing 1&2 cylinder did not seem to make a difference to the idle. Then I
swapped wires (#3 & 2) and the problem migrated to #3 cylinder. Replaced the
ignition wires today and just for fun put in a nice Flame-thrower coil. Now
when I remove an ignition wire, the rpms decrease as expected.

The vacuum is still around 15 inHg, so I have some more work to do, but the
van seems to run smoother. I also still have the hot starting issue to
remedy. But I will look for leaks on the injectors and monitor the fuel
pressure when the engine has sat hot to see if these are causing the
problems. (Cold start injectors does not leak and Thermo time switch works to
spec).

Cylinder compression is:
1 100psi,
2 100psi,
3 110psi,
4 110psi.

I may still do a leak down test, but I think the urgency is less. Any
suggestion on solving backfire problem when decelerating? The deceleration
valve passes the Bentley's test. Not a large backfire and may be caused by
the fact that the fuel mixture is probably rich. Any other suggestions?
Currently the EGR connection on the crossover pipe is rusted out so the
exhaust is not complete sealed. Would this make a difference?
