Subject: Source for oil pressure regulator valve

My oil cooler appears to have blown as oil is coming out all over the engine
with pressure.  The PO said this happened when he started it up on a
brutally ( well as brutal as Washington DC gets, I suppose morning.  Has
anyone experienced this sort of failure and could it be caused by a faulty
oil pressure relief valve?  Anybody suggest a known source for a new relief
valve?
