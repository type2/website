Just a quick question on converting over to the throw away bottles. I =
finally found the adapter and every thing seems to screw together =
correctly, but do I need some type of regulator like the small stoves =
have??? Also I have the original bottle and was not too sure if I should =
hold on to the thing or if it will take up extra space in my shed.
