Subject: Re: [T2] Champagne Edition Bus

I've got one too.

Now mine is red and white with a grey interior. Brown dashes are not common 
but any dash can be brown with some high quality vinyl dye.

Basically they up-scaled the armrests, intermittent wipers, chrome bumpers, 
and possibly better seat covers.

We called it the Cow Poop Edition because there was so much brown on this 
Westy.

I don't know the production numbers.

We decided that we didn't like the color scheme and changed it all. However 
nothing is permanent - the color changes were the only real differences 
between our bus new and our bus now.

I would like to hear about the final production numbers though.

Hope you enjoy your bus as much as we enjoy ours.
