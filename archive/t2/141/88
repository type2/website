Matt,

I should probably not jump in, as my post is very "metoo", but...

If you lift the rear and tie off the steering wheel, you can tow it to
alpha centauri.  I'd regrease the wheel bearings every light year or so,
but there is no limit or problem with towing from this end.

If you lift the front, then (a) you have to be sure the trans fluid level
is good and (b) that it isn't leaking out too too fast.  If both of those
conditions are met, you are fine for ~200K miles or so.

If the trans is a leaker or you are nervous, you can pull the outboard end
of each half-shaft (or the whole thing if you are feeling frisky) in an
hour or less with the triple-square and/or allen head socket and again you
are off to the stars!

And as Dave and Chris both said... having said that, I like a flatbed
truck for towing :-) (And a towing vehicle that is at least 2x as heavy as
the bus!  Braking and stopping is the real problem with towing.)
