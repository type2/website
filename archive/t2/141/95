Subject: Re: [T2] Rap on distributors

Ric (and the rest of you, too :),

I am (until my forehead colides with the keyboard from exhaustion :)
going to try to cover "lessons learned" for three of the four buses I
worked on at everybus, starting with Ric's.  Won't cover bus #2 because
(a) it needed nothing and (b) I forget whose van it was :-)

Ric's bus was bus #1.  It is a 68-70 bus with a type1 engine, ?1600? SP,
no disc brakes.  Ric has just rebuilt the engine and it is running hot, by
his standards (and mine) as he describes in his post.

When I opened the engine compartment I wanted to check three things,
dwell, timing, and vacuum.  His dwell was not spot on, but was well within
adjustment limits (my standards are 45-55 degrees dwell for a type1 engine
and 48-52 for a type4 engine)  His was ~53 and fine.

His destributor was a single vacuum advance with mechanical advance,
source unknown.  His timing...  When I first looked at it, it was 15
degrees BTDC, advancing to 44 BTDC at ~2500-3000.  IMNSHO, this is *WAY*
too advanced!!! I reset it to 7.5 BTDC, which brought his max advance down
to ~38 BTDC.  I was still not too happy, because I don't like to see a T1
engine advancing to more than 35 degrees.  I went over to Jamie Rivewrs
and did a bit of a consult with him and he was strong on 30 degrees max
advance.  I left it as it was, tho I tend to agree with Jamie (plus he
knows a heck of a lot more about T1 than I do!)

When I went to check the vacuum, I made an amazing discovery!  As far as I
can tell, on an early single port manifold, there is *noplace* to check
manifold vacuum!!!!  Am I wrong?????  Did I miss a port on the front of
the dist????

Anyhow, I followed Ric and Chris Slaymaker home to Rics place...  His bus
was still running hot :-(  So at one of the gas breaks, I dropped his
timing another notch to a max advance of 33 degrees, which put his initial
advance at 3 BTDC.  I knew he would have idle problems there, but I wanted
to see if the engine temps dropped.  No good, no drop :-(

At this point, I am stumped.  The only thing I can think of is that his
mix is lean either becasue of (a) a vacuum leak I could not check for
becasue of the lack of a port or (b) a clogged or too small main jet.

My suggestion to him is that he take it to a shop and ask them to plug in
an EGA and see what his mixture was.

On what dist he has.... I should have pulled it out and had a look, but
didn't (my bad), but I believe that he has a distributor for a '76-79 bus
on there, because of the combination vacuum/mechanical advance and becasue
of the range.  A 30/1 degree advance range is simply too much for a T1
motor, and I believe Ric has the opposite of the 009 "not enough advance"
problem with his current distributor.  As an amusing side note, we walked
around a bit to find a T1 with a vacuum advance dist, and FAILED!!!!  We
checked ~10 busses and every one of them had an 009!!!!

I would dearly love to hear any comments on what I did wrong/could have
done in addition to what I did.  I am a bit upset at failing to correct
Ric's problem :-(
