I have not found this to be the case in 16 years of '72 ownership.  What I 
have found to be true is that '72 was the first year for many parts used 
72-79 and the last year for other parts used 68-72.  1972 was definitely a 
transition year, but no worse or no better than others as far as parts 
availability is concerned.
