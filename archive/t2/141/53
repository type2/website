Subject: My rear end is squeaking!

OK, actually it's my *bus's* rear end that's making noise. It's those dang 
spring plate bushings. I changed 'em when I corrected the sag last week (in 
Chuck's garage in Reno, which is another story, a much longer one and very 
entertaining, which I'll probably write up on Friday).

Anyhow, I used new bushings which were genuine VW and dusted them down with 
baby powder, just like Bentley says. Now they are squeaking like a closet 
full of tweaking mice. What gives? Should I have used graphite? Bentley says 
don't use it, Haynes says use it, so I went with Bentley. Has anyone had any 
experience with this? Will the squeaking stop once they've worn in? Should I 
re-tighten the spring plate covers? I wish I'd saved the old bushings, 
because I'm tempted to reinstall them (they didn't squeak, but were probably 
32 years old so I just replaced them as a matter of course). This is really 
just an annoyance but all the same, I'd like to hear any thoughts that might 
be out there.

Thanks!
