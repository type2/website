Hi everyone.  the wife has a 75 bus and I have a 67 bug.  I am thinking about 
a type 4 conversion for the bug and was wondering what the major difference 
is between the 914 engine and the bus engine?  Besides about thirty horses!  
If I were to find one for the bus can I still use the factory injection?  
Thanks and does anyone know of a good type 1 email list
