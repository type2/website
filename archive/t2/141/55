Subject: Wanted- jumpseat out of pre-72 style westy

The Captain is already looking forward to the
next campout and planning ahead.  You see, I plan
to bring the whole crew this time, and I will
need more seating.  Anyone have a rear facing 71
style jumpseat that needs a new home

Peace and blessings,
