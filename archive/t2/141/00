Subject: '79 Westy for sale in CO!!

Hi volks,
I unfortunately need to sell my '79 westy camper to help with costs on my '67 project.  It runs fine now, I've put a bunch of work into it, but still has 170K on original engine
with "rumored rebuild" at 100K (no paperwork?).
Anyhow, I'm selling for $1600 obo.
Let me know if you're interested as I would love to sell to someone who would take care of my home!  Drop me a line and I'll get you specs or set up a test drive.
I live in Fort Collins, CO.
thanks,
mark
