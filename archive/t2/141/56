Subject: Vacuum hose question


Over the weekend I had the headlight switch burn up and now the instrument
lighting is out.  Pretty scary to see all that smoke pouring out of the
dash.

Anyway, I replaced all of the old tiny vacuum hoses between the distributor,
airbox and fuel pressure regulator.  I used the correct metric size hose and
now when I start my bus instead of starting instantly, it cranks over a
couple of times.

I was careful not to disturb any hoses I didn't replace but what gives?
