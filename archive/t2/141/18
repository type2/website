Subject: camper light 1972

while digging out the lower cabinet in the west i
found a bunch of tools, hoo ya!!  and i came upon a
light that has two microswitches and room for 3, 12
volt bulbs of the dome light type.  it is about 7
inches long and has a broken white cover for it. 
where does it go in the bus and could someone please
send me a pic of theirs mounted?  thanks
