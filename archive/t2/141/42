Subject: My Everybus Pictures

Hello,
  Thanks for the fantastic time this past weekend.  It was great to meet
everyone and to see all the buses.  I was needing a vacation and this hit
the spot.  After sharing the photos with my parents, they've decided they
want to bring their Eurovan to the next campout in our area, and to Everybus
next year.  Anyway, here are the photos that I got.  They're just in a list
for now, I haven't had time to add captions yet.
