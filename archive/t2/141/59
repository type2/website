Heya Volks,

I've got a Solex 34-Pict 3 that needs a new throttle shaft bushing, and I
was wondering if anyone could recommend a shop in Colorado (Fort
Collins/Denver/Boulder area preferred) that does this.  Actually, shops in
the Sacramento, CA are would be fine too.

Failing that, if anyone can recommend a reputable place to mail my carb to
have the throttle shaft re-bushed, I'd appreciate it. 

While, I'd like to get it done sooner than later, I care more about the
quality of the work than anything else.

thanks,
	-tom

	 -just in case he wanted to add accessories (#7 fuse in a '71) --
	 - how nice of them!
