Subject: Full Moon Bus Club Address Book

Hey Moonies, At least I hope....  :)  IF you received this email and you are
not in the Full Moon Bus Club please email me so I can remove your name from
my list.  I am sorry but when converting from one computer to another my
database got screwed.

Please don't just delete this (please let me know) if you are not a Moonie
tell me or you will keep getting mail from us...  Just reply with
unsubscribe and I will forever remove you from the list.

If you are a Moonie and I am sending to the wrong email address.  Also let
me know.

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
