            Hey all, those who were around my area at EB know that I
have plans on replacing my injector seals.  Got down and dirty and
looked in there good.  All I can say is, I am surprised that I have not
ran into fire problems by now.  I removed the two 10mm nuts holding the
injectors on.  Now, I was going to go ahead and unscrew the clamps
holding the fuel lines, but I have a newbie question.  How much fuel
will come out of these?  Will they only drip a little and then stop, or
keep dripping until I plug them? For everyone else, this is a 78 with a
typeIV. Thanks again.
