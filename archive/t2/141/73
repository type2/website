(1) Yesterday Am - ambient temp around 50 degrees F - test the leads on =
the wires going to cold start.=20
Read 10 volts when starter was turned over, and continued to read 10 =
volts after 12-15 seconds of=20
the starter turning the engine over. Bad Thermo time switch??

(2) Installed different aux air reg. (from junkyard) - Van starts =
better, but still idling a bit rough. Heat up to 185 and blow into hose =
- no air goes through -> good aux air reg

(3) Today AM - ambient temp mid to upper 40's, will not start with out =
pumping on gas, start and idle (but rough -drifting up and down) after =
stepping on the pedal 4-5 times. Idling high 1100-1200 at stops now when =
warm. Pulled over and turned it down. Idle at start up non-existant, =
unless I pump gas pedal 5-8 times prior to start up -> low rough idle =
800-1000 and then 1000 rpm at stop after driving it.=20
