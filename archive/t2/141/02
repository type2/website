If memory serves, I had an EA case in a 74 914 and I checked it as correct 
in the Porsche manual. The T-IV 411/412 Bentley is likely the only one I 
don't have. If someone has a T-412 Bentley, they could look it up and see 
if they used EA cases.  I doubt it, but would have to verify it in Bentley. 
Look in the final pages of the engine section for the case info.

Incidently, the EA I serviced was 2.0L, electronic injection, had the 
adjustable pressure regulator and full factory gauges, a rare special 
edition for that year. A fine upgrade for an earlier T-II, with a bit of 
sorting out the particulars of getting oil in and checking level. Beware if 
the carbs are stock jetted Solexes for 1.7 or 1.8 motors, a set of jets 
could well tune it to much better milage and drivability. A drop of oil on 
the throttle shafts every inspection will make them last much longer.
