Subject: '73 Westfalia questions / Friday night

Spent from 5PM - midnight Friday night doing the same for a student friend 
here at the University where I work.

Local yokel (know the mechanic) been wrenching on this fellow's van and 
IMHO left it a mess. He's got the center mounted Weber carburetor and it 
was only running on two cylinders. He left with it running on 4 cylinders 
but we still need to adjust the valves and replace the distributor with a 
better candidate. His is the vacuum advance with vacuum retard with the 
retard disconnected. He's running an 1800cc Type IV.

Anyone have an opinion of what he needs to be looking for in the 
distributor department? My guess is one similar to the vacuum advance like 
I have on two '78 2.0 Type IV's.

He said he had never been in another van so his "mental or 
seat-of-his-pants baseline" was never set. I gave him a ride in a friend's 
well cared for '78 Riviera and let him pour over my '78 Westy-in-progress.

There's always lots of little things missing from a VW van that you might 
not even realize is missing unless you pour over Bentley service manuals or 
ETKA. Good to look at other engine bays and such.
