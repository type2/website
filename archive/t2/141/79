Subject: Re: [T2] Question replacing injector seals....

If I remember correctly between the pump on one end & the pressure reg
on the other there isn't much fuel that will spill out. But.....you're
not going to stop with only those lines, are you? I would highly
recommend replacing the entire loop of rubber. That includes the lines
that connect the tank to the pump/filter/press reg. You won't have to
worry about it after doing this. If you are feeling froggy, you can
also install a cut off valve on each of the tank connections (this is
how I was able to change my fuel pump at EB & only slightly smell like
gas, which was an improvement from my prior smell (: ) Good luck.
