Indeed, I will have to pull the Porsche manual to see if I'm dead wrong or 
in fact the EA is a Porsche case. My memory doesn't serve near as well as 
the Bentley or other factory manuals. That's why they're essential to 
verify the facts. Regardless, 80hp in a T-II would be a very nice boost if 
you get the carbs serving it properly.
