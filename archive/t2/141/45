Hey all, man EB 2002 was a blast.  For those that couldn't make it,
there are pics at my site.  I almost didn't make it myself.  1 cylinder
not firing.  Anyhow, as I plan on doing this a lot more, I have run into
somewhat of a problem.  I have a 78 transporter that has no type of
cabinets or conversions at all.  What I have done in the past is bought
a piece of plywood that lays down over the rear storage area and the
back seat when its folded down.  Problem is that the back seat is the
only other seat in the bus and my 3 year old needs to sit somewhere.  I
was lucky enough to grab 2 additional seats at EB and want to mount one
of them directly behing the driver seat.facing the rear.  I was
wondering if anyone could help me out on how make something that would
allow the seat to be exactly the same level as the two fronts seats.
Also any ideas on how I could mount it?  With this I would be able to
leave the back seat down.  Much easier.  :-)   Thanks for the help.
