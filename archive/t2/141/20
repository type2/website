I had the exact same problem a year ago...

 From your description, I'd imagine the best thing to do is this:

First, remove the glove compartment.  Then move the nuts on the inside 
of the wiper shaft back enough so you pull back on the wiper pivot from 
the inside, giving yourself enough of the shaft so's you can hacksaw it 
off.  Then just slide the shaft out the front of the bus.

I'm pretty sure Joe at bustedbus.com sells all the replacement parts you 
might need...

And hey, just be glad it wasn't the driver's side wiper - now THAT'S a pain!

Well, I was tightening the bolts on my wipers today, and the passenger side 
bolt snapped right in half. It's the 72-style bolt that has a 13mm hex top 
with a rounded dome and a hollow, threaded shaft to go around the wiper arm 
peg. As a result, I have a round nut burrowed inside the wiper arms, with no 
way to reach it from the outside, let alone get a grip on it. Anybody know 
what I'll have to do to get this thing off and replace it? Will I have to 
take the whole assembly out?
