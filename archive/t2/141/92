Subject: Re: [T2] towing question

Take the advice about heavy vehicle and braking very seriously...  Last
summer I towed a westy from OH to AZ (at least I'm moving in the right
direction!).  I used a trailer with electric brakes.  Just as an experiment
I turned off the electric brake controller and tried to stop hard from 65-70
mph.  It was not a pretty site, with the controller on and properly adjusted
I hardly knew the trailer/vehicle was there.  As an aside, I was towing with
a F*rd Expedition with the big motor and towing package.  Leave plenty of
room for stopping!!!  BTW when the wind gets the trailer fishtailing), a
slight activation of the electric brake controller can straighten things
right out.
