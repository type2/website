Subject: Rap on Distributors #2 (Jose's bus)

The second bus I looked at was also an early (68-70) bay, owned by a
member of the FMBC, named Jose. He had no initial complaint, he was just
generally worried.

The history as I got it was that the bus had been sitting for quite a
while and he had just pulled it out of the weeds and gotten it running.
Good job, Jose!!!!!

Checked his dwell, which was within limits (~46 as I remember) and timing,
which was also OK.  He had a stock pulley, which had two notches and it
lined up with the one I remember as being the 7.5 VOR notch, so if he has
hte right puley, his timing was fine.  I recommended, as I usually do,
that he get degree wheel pulley.

Note on pulleys: VW put so many different pulleys on engines, and so much
swapping has gone on, that at this point the cheap, sleezy looking "billet
look" degree wheel pulleys are really the only way to go :-(  I hate them
for appearances sake, they are truly non-stock, but I no longer trust any
pulley to report facts to me.  Bummer :-(

Lastly, his fan belt was as loose as a politicians tongue, which is not a
pretty sight on the podium and worse in the engine bay of a bus.  All
standing around agreed this was a "bad thing" and I am hoping he replaced
it soon (he had a new one in the bus)  I believe the reason it was lookse
was that  his pulley was <euphemism> quite rusty </euphemism> from sitting
as lng as it had.  If it were mine, I'd have sanded the heck out of the
groove with some 220 grit sandpaper bfore installing the new belt.
