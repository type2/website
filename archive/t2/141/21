Subject: Mechanic Referral in SoCal

OK, Speedy's beyond my help.  Particulars are: T1 1600 dp, dual Kadrons, 009
w/ Pertronix, stock heads, oil breather kit, 1-3/8" extractor, dual qp's.

I need a referral to a good mechanic near Costa Mesa, CA.  I have a bad oil
leak from what appears to be the oil cooler.  I have removed the engine
twice in three weeks to replace the oil cooler seals (yes, all 4) with
worsening results.  The first time it was out, I had the cooler pressure
tested at a local shop.  This last time, I didn't only because I found the
top oil cooler bolt a little less than tight.  After we put it back together
again with fresh seals, and reinstalled it, it was leaking again, ony now it
seems worse.  We had it at idle for at least 20 minutes to warm up, a few
revs here and there, and no leak.  Then I took it for a spin, and voila, oil
seepin from the left side of the fan shroud.

So, if anyone could recommend a reputable VW shop near Costa Mesa, CA that I
can take the engine to, that would be great.  I'm only taking the engine in,
no bus.  This way I can save a bit on labor, and work on some other things
while its out.

Thanks for letting me vent a little frustration,

Simon
