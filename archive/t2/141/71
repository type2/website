Subject: towing question

I need to tow a 74 bus from Ohio to NC. Assuming I have no
special equipment, which I don't, what is the best way to do
it? I called a rental place, and they said a tow dolly couldn't
be used because the "driveline is too hard to disconnect". They
suggested a trailer (all 4 wheels off the ground). Yea, nay, bogus,
or right on?

thanks...
