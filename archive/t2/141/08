Subject: Re: [T2] a type 4 motor, what is it?

I looked at a web site with info on Type 4 cars http://www.hallvw.clara.net/
It says the case could have been in 1972 type 2 , and the oil filler
configureation would be consistent with a type 4 fastback..

Now , how do I tell if it is an alum/magnesium or all aluminum case?
I have been told that i need to find an all aluminum case for buildin into a
2.0
