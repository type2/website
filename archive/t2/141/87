Subject: Re: [T2] towing question

I've done a few hundred miles with a towdolly.

Disconnect the half-shafts if you like. I didn't but would in the future to 
be sure I don't ruin a tranny. There are things spinning in there that 
don't normally spin much without the engine running. In other words some of 
those shafts might not get enough lube but what exactly I don't know.

Lastly - be sure your tow vehicle is big and heavy. A bus can start pushing 
you around on downhill slopes.

I prefer a flat tow or all four tires off of the ground given my druthers.

As far as disconnecting the driveline - it's a 30-45 minute job on a bad 
day... 1 tool.
