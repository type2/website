Subject: FS 82 Vanagon + Parts van

My wife says it's either HER or two vans.  It was a tough decision. 
Does anyone need a slightly used wife?  No I guess not.

I purchased this 82 van last year to rebuild as a work vehicle.  It 
has a completely rebuilt engine (New heads, lifters, cam, oil pump, 
and PCs).  It also has a new tranny (Rancho).  I'll even throw in the 
82 parts van I have.  White body in good condition with air vent. 
$2500.  That's less than I have in it.

To a good and caring home only.

Tnx
Steve
