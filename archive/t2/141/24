Hi Steve,
I was wondering if you would mind if someone videotaped the seminar also?
Maybe redistribute with funds from copies going to T2 list.  Just a
thought...As I was watching you this weekend I was thinking it would be
great for others to hear this.

It was a pleasure meeting you again...

To all the non-Moonies (I already thanked the Moonies) that donated food and
helped out at breakfast .. Thank you for your help...

Peace Brother,
Snoopy
