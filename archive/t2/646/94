I think it's Pine. See the settings:

enable-sigdashes
If set and a signature-file exists, the line consisting of the three
characters "-- " (dash dash space) is included before the signature. This only
happens if the signature doesn't already contain such a line.

In addition, when you Reply or Followup to a message containing one of these
special lines and choose to include its text, Pine will observe the convention
of not including text beyond the special line in your reply.
