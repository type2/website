Subject: Bussing on "winter" gasoline

Hey,

I just checked my gas mileage in my 71 bus, for the third time since the end 
of October and have noticed that my gas mileage aint what it should be. I 
normally get somewhere between 19 to 23 mpg, now its about 12 to 15 mpg.

I have check timing, points, carb, plugs, checked for vacuum and fuel leaks. 
Everything seems OK.  I have heard older cars dont like this extra oxygenated 
fuel we use during cold weather in Maryland.

 Is this true?  Can I do anything about it?
Or should I check something else.
