Subject: Won't go into third/ fourth or reverse gear

I have a 76 VW bus westfalia camper. It has a 2100cc pancake engine.  I
have had it over a year now and it has not given me any problems.  Im a
VW enthusiast who has little experience in repair.  The only thing i had
to change was the alternator and voltage regulator.  But, the strangest
thing has happened.  I was driving on the highway and got pulled over
and as i was merging back into traffic i could not get into third,
fourth or reverse.  

Moments before the pullover, i had stopped for gas and noticed that i
had a very hard time getting into reverse.  Before this day i never had
such difficulty moving into gears.  Im really at a lost to what my
problem is.  
Can anyone please help me trouble shoot so i may fix my beautiful bus. 
Is my transmission shot?  or did i slip out of my gear box? 

Thank you for your time.
