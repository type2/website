Subject: Re: [T2] Tire noise

Sounds like a bad tire.  I had weird tire-wear on my tires 
and they'd make repetative noises when I drove.  I didn't 
realize how bad the tires were until I got new ones.

The tread on my tires looked somewhat normal, but the 
tread was actually worn at weird angles.  I think that's 
what was making the noises.
