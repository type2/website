Subject: Looking for part...

Hi,

I am looking for the piece that goes from below the tin to the heater
box. There is a tube that goes from the hot air fan to the tin, and I
need the piece that continues under the tin to the heater box. I can't
find any pictures of it, nor do I know a part number. Anyone know where
I can get this piece, both sides? Any thoughts would help.

Peace

Meg
