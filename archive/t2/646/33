Hello Guys     I have seen many a cam fail .  Starting way back with the 36 
hp eatting the gears off, had a soft fiber gear also seen on early Volvos ,  
Seen a bunch of the type 4 cams have the rivits break off or just shear the 
shaft right at the gear. I would think that both the cam and lifters are hardened 
the same. What will wear the lobes out is improper seating and lack of oil 
changes. also too high tension on the valve springs. later and have fun  Mark
