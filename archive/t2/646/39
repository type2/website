Subject: Re: [T2] Losing Brake Fluid

 Hi Vincent ~~~
 Two things: The brakes are THE most important thing in your Bus. If there
is ever, ever any question about your brakes, fix/replace p-r-o-n-t-o!!!
Second: Save $200 and do it yourself. You can do it cheaper and better since
you'll be doing a careful and thorough job. Unfortunately, I've been so
short of time in some instances that I have paid the labor just to get it
done quickly. The parts prices sound reasonable to me. Save some cash and
DIY.
