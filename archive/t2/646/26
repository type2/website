Very interesting reading. So back to the original question, looks like
an average of 2% mpg loss for fuel formulation, and 20% for winter
conditions, split between vehicle mechanical conditions and changes in
driver habits.

Thanks for the link.

 See pages 4 and 5 which state that winter weather is more to blame
for lower fuel economy than the winter forumulated gasoline.
