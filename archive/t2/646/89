Wes Brown had a problem like this not long ago. April 1, 2004 he called me 
from the road and said he found the problem and his bus had found a ditch 
and a guard rail. That part was a joke due to the date. We looked at it 
before he left. He thought it might be a ball joint or something similar 
with the suspension. 50 miles down the road from my house he found a buldged 
lump had formed although it was not there before. Keep an eye on it. Maybe 
have it checked for balance. It sounds like it is associated with that 
tire/wheel if the sound moves when they are rotated. Did you get any type of 
warranty with them? Even with depreciation it could help if you have to get 
a new one or get it balanced.

Good Luck,
