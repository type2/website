Well, that's it. These are not held on by nuts. They have small metal
studs that fit into plastic keepers that press into the holes on the
nose. All you have to do is pry to remove the emblem. I bought some
spares off ebarf but they turned out to be the little ones for late
bays. Plastic too. Hey, maybe you could cast emblems from one of your
plastics. Original emblems are way too high, about $100. Maybe you
could make them from plastic for $20 or so retail.

 it, but I was going to move the spare to the front anyway.
 
 How do they get it off without access to the inside of the bus?
