Of course they are not the same at all. The engine support for early
bays is a pressed metal piece like a T3. The late bay support is a
sturdier tubular construction. To compare exact dimensions, I don't
know that I have an early support on hand or not.

So, anyone know what the difference is between the 68 support and later
bays? Is there any difference?
Thanks
