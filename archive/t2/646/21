Hi Brian,

Older cars don't like oxy fuel because the seals are older and tend to
break down and leak under exposure to this fuel. The formulation
difference is not significant enough to cause such a radical change in
gas mileage.

I'd look more to fuel delivery issues. Are you running lots of short
trips where the choke is engaged and doesn't really warm up enough to
fully disengage before your trip is ended?

As you operate the accellerator through the various RPM's, observe
down the carb throat and ensure there is no leakage or dripping inside
caused by ruptured accellerator pump or stuck needle valve.

You may also be using more throttle to compensate for fuel
condensation on cold intake manifolds.

 I just checked my gas mileage in my 71 bus, for the third time since the end
 of October and have noticed that my gas mileage aint what it should be. I
 normally get somewhere between 19 to 23 mpg, now its about 12 to 15 mpg.
 
 I have check timing, points, carb, plugs, checked for vacuum and fuel leaks.
 Everything seems OK.  I have heard older cars dont like this extra oxygenated
 fuel we use during cold weather in Maryland.
 
  Is this true?  Can I do anything about it?
 Or should I check something else.
