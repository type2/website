Subject: Back to my battery and starting

Wayne:  I'm still a bit puzzled by all of this..... just as you must be.  
Before the weather gets tooooo cold, why not go to your FLAPS or mass 
merchandiser and buy some new battery cables and good grounding straps (engine 
to chassis and battery to chassis).  Don't go with the cheapest; get ones with 
some copper in them.  Pick up one of the wire brushes for the inside and 
outside of battery connexions, and use it 'til the metal shines.  [Later you 
can brush the terminals with some grease.]

Also.... try to take a look [if you can] at the conductor from one side of the 
solenoid into a grommet on the starter motor.  It is not impossible this has 
lost conductivity.  Of course another starter would probably address this 
contingency.

I did do a jumper cable from battery to engine ground... not improvement.
