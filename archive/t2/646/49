Subject: Re: [T2] Official AIRS Update... -php hosting service needed?

I think it was mentioned that a hosting service was needed.  I 
remembered that my friend owns a server w/ php and mysql.  Do you still 
need space as I might be able to get space for very cheap, if not free. 
  Let me know if you still need the space.

thanks,
Mike
