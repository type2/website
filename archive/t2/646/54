Subject: Good News, Bad News, Bus for Sale

Hey there Volks! I just flew back to NC after a long weekend in Austin, TX. 
I have been given a job offer I can not refuse. This is part of the good 
news. The bad news is that now I am so close to getting el Verde on the 
road, I have to sell her. Along with most of my parts and such. This 
includes my '69 Convertible. I need the cash to move and work. I will be 
posting soon to the samba with pics and all. The list will get first dibs. I 
will try to list everything that I have done, what comes with it, what is 
left to do, etc. And pics, lots of pics. Anybody interested in some good 
deals let me know what you are looking for and I will see what I have. I 
will try to make a good list of the stuff that I can't move. You guys and 
gals have helped so much that I can't thank you enough. So even though I 
need the cash the most, I will donate 20% of anything I sell to the list. 
Although I will be busless for a while, I will be here and I will be back.

Thanks to you all,

Michael Knight
'77 Westy Deluxe, "el Verde"
