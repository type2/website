Subject: Losing Brake Fluid

I `m losing brake fluid in my reservoir, But no dripping under the Bus. The  
mechanic said that the Master cylinder was leaking into the engine and he  
recommends that I replace the Master cylinder  ($50)  and the booster  or servo 
($200) plus labor and Tax, Total about $450.00
The mechanic also said that he has another customer who has the same  
problem, but just keeps adding brake fluid in the reservoir.  It `s up to  me.  I 
like to keep my Bus in the best condition possible, But I also do  not want to 
waste money and do unnecessary repairs.
My question is,  is this repair necessary, and is the price  fair?
Any advice will be appreciated.
