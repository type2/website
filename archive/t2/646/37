A total coverup job... Did you notice how they were fixing the rusty rockers? Insert a piece of scrap metal and screw or pop-rivet it down and then cover with filler. I have done this but it obviously is a quickie fix done by an amateur, not by "pros" with all the tech tools you could imagine. They should have cut a patch panel and then welded it in... That is what I do now. 

No mechanical work, no anti-rust work under that fancy interior insert, no soundproofing, not brakes or suspension work that a 30-40 year old vehicle is prob in need of. Assuming the owner had not done it already... 

I was diasppointed b/c it was not a "real" resto with some custom styling, but an Earl Shreib cover-up. Nice interior accents and paint but no substance. 

Did anyone notice the dash/overhead fan console? I noticed several lumps and bumps (wrinkles?). And the surfboard stuff? How does 1 person, hold the board up there and bucket the straps? Seems difficult.
