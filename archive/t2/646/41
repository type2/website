Subject: Re: [T2] Losing Brake Fluid

The brakes are only connected to the engine by the vacuum line on the 
booster.  If you have used so much fluid that it had leaked to the booster 
and overflowed that and travelled the length of the bus to the engine 
itself, you do have a neat problem.  If that is truly what the mechanic 
said, I might look for a second opinion.  You might check into loss at the 
wheels outside the brake assemblies or inside where it might be burning off. 
Have you niticed any strange smells?  Let us know...

|I `m losing brake fluid in my reservoir, But no dripping under the Bus. The
| mechanic said that the Master cylinder was leaking into the engine and he
| recommends that I replace the Master cylinder  ($50)  and the booster  or 
servo
| ($200) plus labor and Tax, Total about $450.00
| The mechanic also said that he has another customer who has the same
| problem, but just keeps adding brake fluid in the reservoir.  It `s up to 
me.  I
| like to keep my Bus in the best condition possible, But I also do  not 
want to
| waste money and do unnecessary repairs.
| My question is,  is this repair necessary, and is the price  fair?
| Any advice will be appreciated.
