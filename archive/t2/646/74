Sorry to hear that.

It's a shame grabbing trim from someone's vehicle seems to attract some 
folks.

After watching the latest "Pimp my Ride" last night seeing them clean up 
a splity I'm reminded just how much potential is left in my VW.  That 
guy's van was pretty trashed.  The new chrome emblem looked a lot nicer 
than the old pitted white one.

Maybe a new emblem is an opportunity?  ...to be followed by an alarm system?

A quick search on ebay revealed these bus emblems:

In addition there is one from the rear of a Toureag in Michigan.

Anyone in michigan with a Toureag missing an emblem?
