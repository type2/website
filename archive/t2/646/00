Subject: Re: [T2] Rear Brakes locked up - should I be concerned?

I second the collapsed brake line. I have a bad one right now. Looks fine from the outside and will allow pressure to pass to the caliper but the caliper doesn't have enough umph to push the fluid back to the reservoir in any reasonable time. Consequently if you put the brakes on, they stay on.
