Subject: Split bus on MTV

Since we talked about this last week, I recorded it with my Tivo. I got a
chance to watch it last night. They did a decent job on the bus. They only did
a few things over the top. The bus was completely gutted when the kid drove
it, so they did not remove much. They added a 40 inch tv behind the front
seats and added a wrap around couch, playstation, dvd player and marine radio.
Safari windows and a roof rack. The roof rack had a mechanism that lowered the
surf board down so that you could get it easily. It had a cool little sign
that popped out on the side and said "CHILL". Kind of like a stop sign on a
school bus. Then they added a clothes dryer to the back to dry your clothes.
The owner was a surfer. The paint was two tone white and green. All in all I
thought they did a nice job of not pimping it to much. They never did say what
they did to the engine. Although they added something like three batteries to
it and several invertors.
