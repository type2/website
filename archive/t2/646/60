Subject: EGR Filter 

I have a egr filter for sale that I am pretty sure is for my 78 Westy. Does not have any part numbers and I can't find and pictures on the web to compare it to. Anyone have any pictures to tell the difference in years and auto vs manual?? I also have a couple valves and various pipes that go with it.
