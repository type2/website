Richard,

What kind of noise?  Rock in the tread?....yeah, I know, you would 
have looked for that..


Wonder if the rim is cracked somewhere around one of the supports or something?

Can you make it do it if you push the bus back and forth at a certain 
place?

Makes the noise in a straight line or just on curves?

Cheers, dave
