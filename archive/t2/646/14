Same here in Oklahoma, getting 14 mpg.  I've heard producers gradually 
start the "winter" blend gasoline in October, working to full "winter" 
strength by January.  Producers  gradually go back to summer blend 
starting in March.  By June, gasoline is a full "summer" blend.  It 
could be, however, the cooler temperatures affecting fuel mileage.  My 
2 cents worth!
