Subject: Re: [T2] Bussing on "winter" gasoline

not just you, my 78 is getting really bad mileage recently and I can't
find anything different.  I'm also in Maryland.  I'm down to 14mpg on my
last fill up (today)

Same with me here in nj., any body else in jersey notice, are we getting that
oxegenated gas yet here?
