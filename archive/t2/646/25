Subject: Bussing on "winter" gasoline

I had noticed a decline in fuel economy and shrugged it off as a 
shortened tune-up interval, but I am holding out for the 3,300 mile 
mark.  In any event, I noticed also that my tires were squealing on 
cornering, so I checked the pressure, and it was down all around.  I 
corrected it, and no more squeal.  Then I noticed an improvement in my 
MPG at subsequent fill-ups.  Coincidence?  Maybe.  Worth checking into? 
  Certainly!
