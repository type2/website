Subject: Re: [T2] Cheap Bosch Points, any thoughts????

Hello Courtney and the list,

That is what I was thinking of doing. If more people
sound interested, I will buy them and do just that.
$1.00 a set is not a bad price considering they are
currently selling for $2.50 a piece. I will see how it
goes. Thanks for the interest!

Have a great day!

Regards,
David Kelly
