Subject: Thoughts on changing tops-Angled to a horizontal?

My friend totaled his ,74 westy.  His top goes straight up with the full bunk up there.  Cargo roof top compartment in the front over the cab. <p> My '72 westy is the angled version with the cot.  My cargo roof top compartment is in the rear.<p>I did some quick eye-balling and looks like it is not a problem to switch it out?  My fiberglass has big cracks in the front corners where it looks like a P.O. ran into something and cracked it.<p>  What is the weight difference and other things I should be aware of before I make a decision?

Paul
