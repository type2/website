Subject: How do you turn a tight engine

Thanks for all the advice about my rebuilt engine problems on the '82
Westy.

I read the article by Bob (of Boston Engine) and decided to readjust
the valves to 0.006.

Unfortunately, I cannot turn the engine by hand anymore even after
loosening the valves. I've tried turning via the alternator
(recommended way) and even tried the bolt on the fan/crankshaft.

Does anyone know of another way?

I am thinking of lifting up the rear of the vehicle, putting the
tranny in 1st gear and turning the rear wheels.

Has anyone tried something similar? Will I be able to turn the engine
backwards to get the 1-2-3-4 reverse firing order if I did this?

Thanks!
