My own light fixtures are a bit fragile (or at least look like they are), so
I don't want to take them off the bus until I'm ready to make masters from
them.

By "the seals don't show", did you mean:

1. _completely_ do not show,

2. that _no_ part of the seal shows around the edge of the lens,

and 3. that you _cannot_ see any part of the seal through the lens itself?

I can create RTV silicone seals, even bonded somewhat to a lens or lens
mount, but the colors I'm able to produce at present would probably not be
acceptable (try pink, green and blue?)

I'm looking into black and gray colorings, but have been too busy of late to
set aside time for it.
