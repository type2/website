Wow! I stand corrected!
Well, there is no smog control module of any kind of these buses. The only
"device" that I can see on there for emission control is a stock muffler.
And if it is illegal to advertise or sell non-stock mufflers, then there are
a lot of shops selling illegal exhaust systems. Such a non-stock system was
recommended by the rebuilder for this 1776 to allow the engine to "breathe".
He also installed little ports on the valve covers for ducting gases to a
breather, because he said that pressures could build under those valve
covers, and that they needed to be equalized. Any thoughts on this?
I'd just as soon put on the stock muffler system.. I hate those ridiculous
looking things that stick up in the air like a New Guinea native's gourd
underwear! LOL.
Regarding these California Democrats and their dream of building a perfect
socialist Utopia, I've about had enough of them. I don't foresee living too
much longer in the "Golden Shower State".
