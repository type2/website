Subject: Incorrectly installed timing gear?

Here's the deal (71 Westy, 1600DP):
I'm new to the timing part of the tune up procedure.  Extensively
read...but that's it.

I've got the valves adjusted and the pertronix installed.  Engine runs
okay, but I can't seem to make sense of the timing per bartno-tek and my
old Hoover Cd-ROM.

I have found, confirmed and marked TDC by the method of removing the #1
spark plug and using a dowel to pinpoint the exact TDC point.  The pulley
seems to confirm this, as there is a timing mark approximately 1/2 inch to
the counterclockwise from where I marked TDC on my pulley. 

Now the trouble.  My static timing light lights up when the timing mark is
about 1.25 inches counterclockwise from the split in the case.  Dynamic
timing light confirms this (when I can get the durned inductive sensor to
work on the #1 wire.  It works flawlessly on #2-#4, but only makes the
occasional flash when hooked to #1).  #1 gets a spark what looks to be
much more than 5-degrees BTDC.

It appears my timing is set much more than 5 degrees BTDC.  Does this mean
my timing gear was incorrectly installed?  The PO mentioned that his
tune-up guy always had trouble setting the timing.  This engine has about
30k on it, I am told.  

Advice?  Am I missing something,or should I start reading up on pulling
and reinstalling the timing gear?
Thanks,
Greg
