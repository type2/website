Subject: thanks for the bee help!

NEVER underestimate the power of the list! at least 3 people who 
semed to know bees responded, and several who had simply been stung 
did too :)
last night i dressed up in a leather jcket, welding gloves, goggles 
and a hat (then realized i was wearing shorts :P). took a deep 
breath, grabbed the head studs and hauled the engine case from the 
bottom shelf to the top.

not a peep (beep?) from the bees inside.

this morning, i went out to see what was up... 20 or so bees, 
circling the spot where the case was. i yelled 'its 5 feet higher and 
1 ft to the left! its HUGE! how can you miss it?'  you can't really 
take a bee and SHOW it where to fly.
so they spent 4 hours circling the old site, then zipping back out of 
the shed to reorient themselves, sunwise, then coming back in and 
circling. no home.

it was pathetic.

so i finally just grabbed the case, hauled it down to the bottom 
shelf, and placed it right where it started from. no bees so much as 
blinked, let alone stung me.
they circled cautiously, expecting some sort of trick... it would be 
like reporting your car stolen, and as you are giving the report to 
the officer, saying ' i left the car right HERE' and turning around 
to find your car.

an hour later, they were happily fixing any damage done by my moves. 
i'll leave them be.
