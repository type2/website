Subject: Re: [T2] Side marker lens seal

If you're talking about the seal around the edge of the bulb holder (the
plate behind the lens, rear only), I made replacements for mine from plain
(i.e., not the VW kind with the braided covering) rubber vaccum hose.  Cut a
length of hose slightly longer that what is needed to wrap around the edge
of the bulb holder.  Using a very sharp knife and a steady hand, slit the
hose on one side only, making the slit as straight as you can.  Push the
slit hose over the edge of the bulb holder, wrapping the edge of the bulb
holder completely with the hose.  Trim the ends of the hose square where
they meet.  Use trim adhesive if you like, to hold the hose to the bulb
holder.  To my knowledge the front reflectors do not have seals, although
this could be because mine were missing from the get-go, i.e., when I got my
bus 18 years ago.
