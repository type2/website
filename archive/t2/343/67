Hi Paul,

Can you be more specific about the roof on the 74? It sounds like your 
friend has a Riviera pop-top which is different from a 74 westfalia 
roof. I used a 74 westfalia roof to create my Westfakia, and it was 
about 100 hours work to do the swap, which included prep for  a repaint 
since the interior was already out. If you weren't as particular about 
the bodywork you could do it in less time, and you could cut the 100 
hours in half if you are already experienced in bodywork and/or 
autobody welding.

I haven't done a riviera roof swap, but it can't be any more trouble 
than the 74 roof was. I documented the roof swap of my westfakia at:

Happy trails,
