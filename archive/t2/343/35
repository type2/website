Subject: RE: [T2] Can I borrow a backyard in Bellingham, WA?

Well I live in Bellingham, WA and wish I knew about this guy before he
posted this stuff on the auction -- I could have used a couple of parts.
My backyard and my wifes patience are not big enought for all this junk,
so taking it all it not an option.  However, if one of you does, let me
know.
