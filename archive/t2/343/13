Karl's right on here.  I got pulled over by a cop that mistook me for 
someone else then proceeded to pick apart my double cab looking for 
violations to justify pulling me over.  Got a big lecture on "modifying 
engines", "removing smog equipment", "most people don't realize...."  When 
I told him that it was a 1960, he switched back to the mufflers and being 
too loud.  I ended up getting out of the ticket, but it took up about 15 
minutes of my time.

Idiot, this guy is nuts.  Cars 45 years and older are exempted.  I didn't 
think any smog equipment started showing up on cars until 63/64.
