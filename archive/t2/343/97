Subject: '84 Vanagon Instrument Cluster 

Friday I picked up an '84 Vanagon Instrument Cluster

It has speedometer AND tachometer!!

Will this fit a 83 or 82 or any air cooled??

The speedometer has the blade snap on, not screw on speedometer cable, and 
there are a LOT of wires going to the instrument cluster (all cur as far 
back as possible)

Sine the '84 is H2O, I ask if this will fit the air cooled family.

Thanks.

(I only picked this up because it has a tachometer on the right side, in 
place of a clock)
