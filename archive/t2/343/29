What would be really cool is if we could all pool our money together and
purchase this in the name of Type2.  What better donation to the list than a
whole bunch of VW's.  We could keep the Bus stuff and sell the rest.  I
would be willing to pitch in for something like this.  I would really like
some parts off of that 77 Westy!

Just wishful thinking,
