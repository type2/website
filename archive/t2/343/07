Oh, my God! I love the high top. Can we put together some bidders to go in
together? I wonder how long they'd give the buyer to get all that stuff outa
there?
I'm at least going to watch this auction for the fun of it.
What'll end up happening is that the winning bidder will probably take the
cream and leave the junk, then they'll have a huge cleanup job on their
hands. On the other hand, if they own the land, they might give quite a bit
of time to get it all out of there.
