Could it be a problem of cam not being correctly aligned with the
crank?

Yes, I guess it could be, and might be overlooked by the tech who wrote the

checked without tearing the engine down by noting how the valves are moving
as the related piston comes up to TDC.

My emails have not been answered. I'll call them on Monday. Is
Leonard's wife called Erin? She was the one who delivered the engine.

Yes, that's her.
