Subject: Re: [T2] Cheap Bosch Points, any thoughts????

Think about it, have you gotten ANY points lately that WEREN'T made in
Brazil or Mexico or India or Taiwan?? I don't think I've seen any german
points or plugs for about 5 yrs up here in Canaduh. At that price, you
cannot lose. Not to mention you can offer them to others at 1 dollar a set
and make some money to cover your costs. If they'll fit my 009 dizzy, I"ll
buy a dozen off you right now!!
