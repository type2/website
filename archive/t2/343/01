If adjusted with .006 clearance, will that mean that the valves will
close properly?

I looked at the work order again (with summary of work done) and it
said:  "could not adjust the valves any tighter than 1/8 turn
in-should be 2 turns in".

Should I re-adjust the valves back to 0.006 clearance i.e. back out of
the 1/8 turn?

I really really really want this thing to run right. :-)
