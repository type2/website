Magical Mike,
I just ran out in the rain and pulled off the front reflector which should 
have the same seal.
I see the seal is molded to fit around the backing plate.
If you remove the seal from the backing plate and used it as a template on a 
thin piece (1/16"?) of closed cell foam fabric harvested from an old "spring 
suit" wet suit or from an industrial supplier (Granger?) you could make 2 
oversized gaskets per lens, allow for more contact surface between the 2 
seals which you will sandwich the backing plate in between.
(There is room for a wider oversized seal.)
You could pre glue them at the outside seams or use a gasket adhesive between 
them as you reassemble the parts.
The closed cell foam will compress & conform to the lens and backing plate 
ect.
The seals don't show and the main function is to keep moisture out.
I have not tied this for this particular application but have made similar 
applications for other projects, it makes sense to me.
How's that sound?
