Subject: Re: [T2] T4 push rod ID

> The ones in the engine have tapered ends while the new one has "bulb" ends.  I have no history on this
engine so I really don't know its condition, I'm just trying to get it to run.  Could this engine have
incorrect push rods or will the odd push rod work OK with the others?

What year is this engine?
What are the 2 letters in the beginning of the engine id number?
[not the ones on the fan housing, I want to know the ones on top of the case between the fan housing and the
crankcase vent]
Get a magnet. Are the 8 existing pushrods steel or aluminum?
Is the new one steel or aluminum?
Between each pair of rocker arms: Are there springs? Or spacers with a wave washer on each end?
