Bob,

Do yourself a favor and buy two new Yokos, put them on the front or rear,
and use your extra Yoko as a spare. Periodically rotate your spare and your
used tires. You'll eventually have a set of 5 evenly worn tires that you can
rotate, and will have a matching spare for the road.

Cheers,

John
