Magical Mike,
Some seals are designed to create an edge around the part for cosmetic 
purposes such as the front turn signal lenses on a 68-70somthing bus.
This seal is completely enclosed under the lens and cannot be seen behind, 
around the edge or thru the reflector.

P.s. what was poisoning you with Chlorine gas as you stated in earlier posts?
I'm worried about you.
