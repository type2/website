Subject: Got my second bus tonight

Can anyone direct me to a site that has pics of a clutch slave cylinder 
from and 81 Vanagon? Haven't taken mine out yet. Too cold to work 
outside today for very long. Looking for an exploded view to see how the 
whole thing goes together. The factory repair manual I found in this bus 
only shows the assembled view. This manual has the VoA inc. logo on it 
but I don't think it's a Bentley because it's not very detailed.

My daughter came by today, I think she wants my 75 bus. Anyone ever 
teach someone how to drive in a bus? I'm considering letting her have it 
after I get a few more bugs worked out of it but I'm worried about her 
having it as her first car. It can get down right windy up here at times.
Thanks,
Tom
