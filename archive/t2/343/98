Go back to the 1776 daily driver article in Hot VW's several years ago.

If you used a fairly mild cam, it can be done and actuall runs pretty 
well.  I have run mine(engle 100 cam) on a 2 barrel Holey, solex, and 
kadrons.

Solex was fine(re-jetted a little), but you lose about 10-15hp.
Holley was great(28mpg) but barbaric on the kick in when the progressive 
part was active.

Kadrons(with the right linkage!!!!) are civilized, refined and rev as 
far as you care to go.  Lots of pedal and power left at 70mph.

Ask about megasquirt fuel injection later in the fall!!

Cheers, dave
