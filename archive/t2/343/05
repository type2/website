This sounds to me like something is screwed up with the valve train
geometry.   If things are set up correctly you should be able to turn in the
adjuster screw 1-1/2 to 2 turns without any problems.  The issue addressed
by the .006" clearance advise, as I understand it, is to allow air-bound
lifters to pump up.  After they are pumped up you then adjust them to their
"normal" setting, whatever your particular religion tells you is "normal."

I'd ask the tech who wrote that note what he/she means here.  It seems
there's 2 possibilities.  On the one hand the situation might be that, even
with the adjusting screw completely backed out the rocker arm is still in
contact with the valve stem, suggesting lots of preload, and 1/8th of a turn
later the hydraulic lifter has bottomed out.  Or, the adjusting screw could
be so far away from the valve stem that by the time you turn the screw in
far enough to contact the stem you've only got about 1/8th turn left before
the screw is in danger of disappearing.  I'd say either situation is
abnormal and warrants a closer look.

Since this is an AVP engine determine what the tech is saying and then call
Leonard and discuss it with him.  He can be difficult to get a hold of -
you'll probably reach his wife first - and talk through the possibilities.
