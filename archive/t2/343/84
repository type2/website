>Can you be more specific about the roof on the 74?  I used a 74 westfalia roof to create my Westfakia, Yip, His must be a Riviera conversion.  (234XXX XXXX vin).  Any way, the only difference I can see is in the opening.  Mine is about 4" smaller on the front side.  Same size as the original sunroof opening and the riviera opening goes forward more towards the B pillars.On may way home today, I saw another '72 that had a riviera style top on it.  I could not find the owner of the bus, so I was not able to ask any Q's.Paul.
