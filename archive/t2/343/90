Subject: Re: [T2] Got my second bus tonight

Gotta watch them kids in a bus, My girl managed to get
22 kids into one of mine and got me a ticket, her
excuse , I was going to the lake and coulden't leave
my friends behind. the bus is easy to teach in once
they learn where the wheels are. Enjoy the adventure.
Get a bently book to show the clutch cyl, it's easy to
repair. Phil
