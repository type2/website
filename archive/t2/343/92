Check that you don't have your vacuum advance and retard reversed at the distributor.

Hmmm... well that changes things a little.  If it's an intermittent problem, I would suspect a clogged muffler or perhaps an electrical problem such as a loose wire to the coil or condenser, or bad cap/rotor/wires.

But before you do any of that... CHECK THE COMPRESSION.  :-)
