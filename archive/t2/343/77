I agree with all of what Tom said, but please... GIVE THIS MOTOR A COMPRESSION CHECK FIRST!!!

Sorry to yell, but this is so basic... and I am so tired of repeating it.  Why speculate as to whether the valves are too tight, or the geometry is off... when you could have your answer in 15 minutes with a simple compression check?  Do it first, do it often.  It is an excellent way to track the health of your engine.  If your compression is good and you have low vacuum, then you have a VACUUM LEAK.  If your compression is bad, you INSTANTLY know why you have low vacuum!  Valves or rings.  And a quick squirt of oil will tell you which of those two are responsible.  If valves, THEN go after your lifters/rockers/etc..  An added bonus - you will now know which cylinders are responsible!  Be methodical with your troubleshooting and you will get results.
