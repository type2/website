Subject: Front seat swap?

Answering my own question, after doing some measuring: "No, the front seats 
from a '74 bus have rails about 17 inches apart, and the '76 rails are 
12.25 inches apart. And there are other differences."

Doyt, talking to himself.

I have a 1976 Westy with stock individual front seats. Can I buy the front 
seats out of a 1974 Westy and have them slide right in on the rails, 
without reworking anything?

Please reply off list. I am on the digest.
