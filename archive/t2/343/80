Subject: Horrible acceleration 

Hey I have a 73 bus that I bought not too long ago,  it runs great except
for a major acceleration issue,   which is to say that it just doesn't
want to go,   weather the engine is hot or cold.  And sometimes it
accelerates fine,  its just rare.
Now the vacuum advance has been swapped out with one that works,  the old
one didn't move the points when I sucked on the hose etc.
So I thought that replacing that would fix everything,  but it hasn't.

The valves, points,  and timing are dead on.   It is a stock type IV engine
witht he dual Solexs.   The engine starts and idles very smoothly,  good
compression etc...
So is it a carb issue?   I don't know the first thing about carbs,   my
last VW was a FI  squareback so.........
Oh yeah sometimes it will make a backfiring/pinging/misfiring type noise
upon acceleration,   and today the engine even ran on after the key was
off (I double checked timing and it was still dead on 10 ATDC).
I just don't know what to check out........any help would be wonderful...

mark.
