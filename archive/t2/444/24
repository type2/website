This can be a sticking caliper due to the collapsed rubber hose acting as
a one way valve

Loss of brake fluid with no outward signs could be the master cylinder
leaking into the booster, Loosen the master off at the booster, and see if
any fluid drools out ... you may have to pull it back enough to get you
finger in there to see if there is a puddle ...
