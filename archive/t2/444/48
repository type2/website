Subject: front door screen

Hi,

I would like to find some magnetic frame screens for the front doors of
my bus. When I was a kid we had some for our bus. I will make some if I
can't find another manufacture. I seem to need a more powerful magnet
than I originally tested. I cut out the screen and bought magnetic
strips, sew them in a binding around the screen. My mistake was not to
calculate the fact that the material would lessen the magnetic power so
I need to get a more powerful magnet, hopefully in a strip like the
other one.. If I get these the way I want them I may ask if anyone wants
a pair and make a few extras:-)

Anyone know a company that manufactures something like this?

Peace

Meg
