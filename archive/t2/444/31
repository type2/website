Subject: RE: [T2] Towing Jetta for 100 miles

Unless you already have a vehicle with a towbar, the easiest thing to do
is rent a local U-haul truck and towing dolly. If you have a tow vehicle
then just rent the dolly. Make sure those back wheels will roll. If they
don't, then you'll have to rent the vehicle trailer.

I have located a nice scrap 1987Jetta for 60$USD that I'd love to keep
for
spare parts, however it needs to be towed to a good storage space.  It
seems to have four good tires and could probably be towed on all fours.
