That part is NLA from VW of America  and a much needed part in my opinion. I
got one from a listmember from Europe new from VW of Germany once and
recently got one from Busted Bus.  What is this Patti's Parts Palace???

It is much easier to install with muffler out and attaches to the tin on the
underside of the fan with the "fins" up.  It is really easy to see how it
goes in with muffler off.  Hard to take pic unless muffler is off to show
ya.

Not hard at all..

Good Luck,
