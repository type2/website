Subject: [T2] MegaSquirt on westy?

Hi all,

being very unhappy with my dual carb setup (2.0liter '78 westy, dual
solex-carbs), I'm considering a swap to EFI.
Besides the obvious problems/work like getting an intake manifold, linking
the throttle-cable, routing an additional fuel line back to the tank,
installing a CHT-sensor and hook it up to the EFI-system ... I'd like to
know if anybody successfully installed the MegaSquirt EFI-system to his/her
bus and has some long-term experience with it?
The bus is my daily driver, so I want to be sure it's worth the work.

Another question: Did anyone ever install the water-boxer distributor-setup
(electronic ignition-system) in an aircooled type4?

Please share your experience and/or thoughts about this with me.
