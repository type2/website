Subject: Towing Jetta for 100 miles

Good morning,

Can someone please advise a safe, legal & affordable way to tow a scrap
Jetta for 100 miles ?

I have located a nice scrap 1987Jetta for 60$USD that I'd love to keep for
spare parts, however it needs to be towed to a good storage space.  It
seems to have four good tires and could probably be towed on all fours.

I will tow behind my bus or behind another Jetta.  Are tow bars available
for purchase?  Are straps w/ some lights legal on the highway?  All help
appreciated.

Thank you,
Shawn.
