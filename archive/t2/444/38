I've heard of bureaucratic, BS, rip off's before, but this one tops them
all--
A vehicle can't be flat towed without current plates?

I guess The left coast is broke---and looking for any loophole to fill
the monetary Void---

Wow.---

Where's the Terminator when Ya need him ??--:>)

[T2] Towing Jetta for 100 miles 
Can someone please advise a safe, legal & affordable way to tow a scrap
Jetta for 100 miles? 
I saw a couple of replies that said to use a tow dolly and leave the
rear wheels on the ground. 
Before you go this route, you need to check the Vehicle Code in the
state you live in. Here in California, in order to legally use a tow
dolly, the towed vehicle must be currently registered. You cannot have
any part of a non or expired registration vehicle on any street. Even if
it is non-op'd. You would need a car trailer to legally move the
vehicle. If you get a ticket for having a non-op'd vehicle on the
street, it nullifies the non-op status and besides the fine and risk of
impoundment you also must pay the past registration fees and penalties
that the non-op status waived......
