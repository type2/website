Valve stem seals, most of the time they come in the
O/H kit, use them if you have them, if you have new
valve guides you will not need them but if you put
them on they will come out in peices at about 20-30K
when you do need them, this is a catch 22. Use them if
you wan't to or not, I think they (the engine) would
work just as well without them. Phil
