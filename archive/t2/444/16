Subject: Blown fuses

Hi after changing the carb on my 67 deluxe I decided to go on a test run. 
About a mile and a half later the bus cuts out back fires warning lights come on 
as I coast to a halt. Ah I think a blown fuse, replace fuse check wiring for 
anything obvious try to restart engine fuse blows, start disconnecting wires 
from radio electric cool box, replace fuse turn engine over fuse blows, remove 
kick panel check fuse remove fuse holder replace fuse get underneath van short 
across starter motor to spin engine fuse blows, remove ignition switch change 
fuse turn over engine fuse blows, I have now run out of fuses walk to friends 
place and get tow home. The engine starts but as soon as it does it blows the 
main 16amp fuse on the right hand side. Tomorrow I will have to put it right 
any body got any ideas its a 1600 twin port fitted with petronix electronic 
ignition. If not can I run the engine with the dynamo disconected will it harm 
it? I know the dynamo shouldn't have anything to do with the fuse system but the 
fuse seems to blow just as the engine starts. I guess it a good time to 
replace the fuse holder with one I soldered earlier!  HELP Mike
