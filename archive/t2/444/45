Subject: Rip off artists and a head question

Volks,

Rip-off artists really suck.  Lord knows there's plenty of them around,
even in the small VW world.  We are suckers for the taking.  PayPal
helps though.

I have a question about seating heads and cylinders for head space. 
Some of the nuts on the head, (on top, I think) seat well below the
wider hole and the socket won't fit.  What to do?

Options, go by a Sears socket and grind it thin to fit.  

Options, get a dremel and grind the hole out large enough for the
socket to fit.

Options, combination of the above.

Options,  listen to some smart, experienced people here on the List and
do as they say.

????

Curt
