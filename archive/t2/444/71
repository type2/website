Subject: How did you restore your front kick panels?

I want to put the front kick panels back in my 76 Westy; however, they are in
sad shape. I am going to use the old ones as a template, but I'm unsure of
what material I should use as the "board"?The original is that hard cardboard
stuff. I can't find anything like that. What about thin plywood like luan
(sp)?
I have some black vinyl too, but I'm not sure what kind of adhesive to use. I
have some 3M spray that I think will work well- anything better? I seem to
remember doing my Triumph Spitfire's with hot glue. I think you could see the
glue line though- too long -that was 10 yrs ago.

Pictures would be cool too. Suggestions don't have to be for stock restoration
- I thought about putting black fur on them and around the seats- with the
little dingleberries around the windows.

Thanks for any tips,

Nik
