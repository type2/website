theodore,

if it is not the gauge or sender (which it could very well be) - i wonder if
the problem is related to the oil pickup or oil level. this will cause
erratic pressure. sometimes a low pressure "trough" will not register on the
pressure gauge but will on the idiot light. i don't know why this happens
but i had it happen to me once when i had low oil level and went around a
corner - the idiot light flashed on for a split second, but the gauge kept a
normal reading. if i was looking only at the gauge i would not have seen any
problem.
