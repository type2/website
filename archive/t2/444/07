Subject: 2.0 valve stem seals

Hello all,
I'm commencing my 2.0 reassembly.  My heads passed inspection (but do have a
spare:) with only exhaust guides replace and #1 one sparkplug hole repaired.
I have all new valves and have ground and lapped my own seats.  My question
is about valve stem seals.  Does the 2.0 use them?  Haynes page 35 figure
1.13 shows some sort of "oil seal ring" item 5.  Bentley says in section
11.1 section 5 page 37 to install "stem seal ring" for "single carb
engines".  Why would a single carb engine need them and not an injected
model?  Are these seals of value in a 2.0 engine?  From the books these
don't look like the ones which fit over the valve guides of the Toyotas that
I've worked on.  If they are advisable or useful what should I ask my FLAPS
to order?  I tried to find this answer in the library and waded into the
archives with no success ;)

Thanks!
