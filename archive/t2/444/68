Subject: Propane Bottle for VW Stove?

I was wondering how hard it would be to convert the stove in my 78' Westy
to run on the littlescrew in propane bottles that my other camping stoves
and lanters run on? I know it is the same gas so thats not an issue. Its
the fittings and regulator. I am not very knowledgeable about these set ups
on the bus. I removed the tank from my bus because it needed to be cleaned
up and recertified... new regulator etc. The thing was pretty rusty. I
really don't plan to use the stove much and don't need that big tank there.
I figured there should be an easy way to attach a fitting to the hose from
the bottom of the stove that would allow me to just screw on a bottle when
I wanted to use the stove? I would love to see any pictures if anyone has
done this. The costs of a new tank (damn near $300 from GoWesty) just don't
seem to warrant what I am looking for from my stove. Plus with that tank
strapped to the bottom of the bus I am not allowed through some tunnels in
our area. Not to mention what could happen when I botch that gas heater
install and the thing starts spraying flames out from under the old bus  (:

P.S. Sorry but work is a little slow today...
