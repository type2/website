Subject: RE: [T2] Distributor Identification

Hi Folks,

I tried oldvolkshome to identify my distributor but no luck so far. I guess
what im really asking is if its a distributor from a 1600 Type 3 is that going
to cause problems in my 1800 type 2 !

And whats the reccomended options for a 74 1800 Dual carb ? 009 ?


Cheers

Scott
