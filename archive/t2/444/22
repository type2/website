Subject: Re: [T2] Bizarre braking

Definitely. I also have a 70 bus. Replace all 4 brake flex hoses. I am
absolutely sure that they are plugged up internally. I read of this on the
list, the idea came from the Vintage Bus list,  and replaced my rear hoses,
and lo and behold, I cut the old hoses in half and there was no hole in the
middle. The fluid goes through under pressure, but can't return properly,
thus leading to dragging and such. Tom

winter I had some braking problems.  Occasionally, the bus would pull
violently to the left when I braked. >
