Subject: curious valve in a dp head

i have been tearing down engines all weekend and was glad to come across a
german T1 case that that had never been cut. i pulled the heads to find the
pistons kinda rusty. the heads look freshly rebuilt from what i can tell,
but i was still going to clean them up to be sure of no cracks, esp around
the guides. three of the valves are in there pretty good and would need a
jab to get them out. this doesn't seem normal to me, even if the guides are
new. i fig'd if one was stuck perhaps a little metal shaving got in there,
but three? any thoughts from the pros?  - steve
