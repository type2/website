Subject: oil capacity?

Folks,

My new avp seems to need exactly 4 quarts(not 3.7) to come up to the full
mark on my dipstick.  I am using Ron's Mahle oil filters.


Are the filter's larger than original?

Something wrong with my stick?

Anyone have measurements from tip to flat part?...not up underneath, but 
just to the flat part.

Cheers, dave
