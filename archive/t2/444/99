Subject: "bucking" engine on 77 bus (long)

Hey All-

Anyone experience the following symptoms on a 77 FI engine that is dead stock.

After driving on the highway for a number of hours at about 60 mph(i.e, over two hours so the engine gets nice and warm) the engine will sporadically "buck" or surge to the point where the whole bus jerks forward as a result. Obviously this makes driving occasionally disconcerting as there is not a lot of predictability to it. It can happen randomly and then merrily go away again. At first I thought that the problem only occured when going down hill and this was some sort of "backfire" (without the accomplanying bang) but the problem doesn't seem isolated to that.

I haven't done a lot of investigation but my preliminary guesses are spark plug wires or dist cap. The plugs are pretty new as mem. serves. I *hope* it is not a FI problem as I have heard some horror stories trying to diagnose this.

I am hoping that someone else has expereinced this and can maybe shed some light.

Thanks mucho!

M.
