Imagine yourself receiving the preceeding phone message
from the local authorized VW Dealer after being billed $75
for a repair estimate.
An inspection was requested to locate an engine oil leak.
The billed receipt included the following quote -

" Found oil leak ".

The inspection was billed at $75/hr.and was completed in 1/2 hr.
Imagine a dealer mechanic looking at your engine for 1/2 hr.

No repair cost estimate was provided.

Additional repair diagnosis was requested for several other problems,
and Diane was told these would require individual inspections
and billed separately. Steering, brakes, etc., etc.

It will certainly be interesting to hear the dealer recommendation
for service of this repair.
