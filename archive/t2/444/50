Subject: Heat Shield

I bought this heat shield from Patti's Parts Palace and am wondering if
anyone has one installed and can maybe send me a photo or give some install
instruction. It apparently attaches to the cooling tin above the muffler
but I am not sure how or exactly where, never had a bus with one. It has
two brackets, one with one hole and the other with 2 holes. It also looks
like it must have some nice asbestos sandwiched in it... Do I have to drop
my muffler to install?
