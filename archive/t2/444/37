Timo,

Look here for a complete setup.

http://tbone2091.tripod.com/megasquirt/

Pictures, tuning parameters and all...it would probably be much easier to 
start with a complete stock running fi system.

Lots of folks in the UK and Europe have used megasquirt on their non 
air-cooled vehicles vehicles.

There are others on the list that have done it already, and my conversion 
is scheduled for after October 1'st.

Cheers, dave
