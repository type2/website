Meg,

I have never seen a pertronix get "intermitent"...if it is going to 
die...it should just fail...other may have different expierinces.

Meg,  Fuel injected??  First thing I do on a "new" bus is go thru *every*
electrical connector and clean and wire brush and reseat.  Sounds to me
like you have something loose somewhere.

If the connectors don't fit tight, then gently squeeze them for a better 
grip or buy a kit and start replacing them.

So, the first time this happened, what fixed it??

Cheers, dave
