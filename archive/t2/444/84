Those luan door skins make great replacement panels, but I'd like to make 1
suggestion:  After you cut them out and sand them, but BEFORE you stain them
soak a towel in hot water and wrap it around your panel and let it sit for
30-45 minutes.  Then you can gently bend and shape the panel without
breaking it.  Fit it into place and let it dry in place before removing it.
It'll hold the shape that it dries in.  Then you can remove it and stain it.
