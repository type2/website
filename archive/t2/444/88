Subject: Rust prevention on tins

I am buying new push rod tube tins for my 85 Vanagon
GL and will have to do this same thing soon for my 71
Westy.  Does anyone know if products like POR-15 or
Rust Bullet can be used on areas like tins or exaust
pipes?  
I have just started to look, but have trouble when my
4 month old daughter cries for attention.  Any help is
apreciated.
