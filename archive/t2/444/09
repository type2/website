Subject: Re: [T2] Heater straight pipe

Hello Dana   I use a truck exhust pipe for the replacment of this heater 
pipe. Get one thats just a little smaller than the inside of the heater pipe and 
cut it about 2 inches longer so that it will slide into the old part thats left 
and tack weld it into place. Use POR-15 to rust proof it then cover it with 
plumbing insulation. later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service
