If memory serves, a local truck should be around $40. The towing dolly
should be around $40 also. No idea on the price of a flat trailer, $60?

A big factor for towing will be the price, mostly because if it's too
expensive then it's not worth buying this vehicle for spare parts.  I
suppose that renting just the dolly might be good, but if I need the
truck
& dolly then it's probably a wee bit expensive and not worth the price
of
the car + towing.
