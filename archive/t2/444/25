winter I had some braking problems.  Occasionally, the bus would pull
violently to the left when I braked.

Pulls left ? Ignoring alignment, tire pressures, etc.,
That side works good.The problem is on the right side.
Verify good fluid travel ( especially the brake hose ).
Bleeding that side will tell you what you need to know.
Disassemble the wheel cylinder and confirm movement.
Adjust the shoe clearance. Adjust wheel bearings.
ABS aside, there haven't been many brake discoveries
since Fred Flintstone received a patent.
