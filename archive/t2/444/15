What I did was lower the engine about 5 inches.. that gives you enough 
room to pull out the tank.  To do that, put a jack under the engine with 
padding so you don't break the fins (I used a phone book).  Then raise 
it until you're supporting the engine and tranny's weight.  Then unbolt 
the two tranny carriers and the 4 engine hanger bolts.  You might also 
want to drain the tank beforehand and disconnect the fuel lines that go 
from the pump to the engine and also the one that goes from the pressure 
regulator to the tank.  You'll also have to remove the intake stuff, the 
blower fan, and anything else that would get in the way.

Then, take off the firewall, unstrap the tank and pull it out.  It's not 
particularly difficult, especially if you have someone helping.  There 
were two screws coming from the underside of the firewall that hung us 
up for a while...

installation is reverse...  While you have it out, get yourself some new 
fuel hose from a marine store.... and if you really plan ahead, get that 
rubber elbow and change that too.  I think bus depot has 'em.
