 I read your recent post regarding taking your bus to a mechanic and noticed
your mention at the end about getting a piece of foil out of your tank.
Assuming you mean your fuel tank, I was just curious how you were able to
remove that foreign object from the tank.  I've been having a problem with
something in my tank plugging the fuel outlet (and effectively grounding my
bus), and am looking for ways of fixing the problem.  How did you get it out
of there?  Thanks for any information you can provide!

>>So, I take my bus in to get the oil plug fixed, and then when I get the

lines, and I noticed that they crunched one of the metal fuel tubes;  nice,
huh?!<<
