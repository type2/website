Subject: Erratic Oil Pressure

Okay you guys thought I was done with oil pressure didn't you? Well the
wife, 5 month old, and I decided to go camping this weekend. I figured I
would just keep an eye on the gauges since I have been a little unhappy
with the oil pressure situation. Outside temps were much cooler than usual
for this area 65 on sunday. Drove out to the mountains at 65-70 the whole
way and temps stayed at 210-220 with oil pressure above 40 psi and head
temps frozen at 350. Later in the day driving around some back country
roads, BIG hills, gravel, washed out areas... Anyway the temps stayed nice
180-200. But my oil pressure gauge started bouncing all over the place.
Mostly stayed high 50-80 lbs but occasionally bounced down to 25-30. The
next day it continued to bounce around a lot even on the highway at 65-70
it was bouncing between 40-50 lbs. What I am wondering is if the gauge is
acting up or if its my pressure relief springs? I noticed that one time I
got it hot 230-240 temps going up a big hill the idiot light came on when
we stopped at idle. (850-925rpm) The funny thing is that with the VDO
sender the light seems to come on at 10lbs, but the gauge was bouncing
around 20-30? I got this gauge out of a junkyard bus but it is a VDO, and
the right one at that? Does the pressure relief valve keep the oil pressure
constant when driving? If my gauge pegs at 80lbs for a while when driving,
especially when cool,  180 or lower, is this dangerous for the oil cooler
seals? I am planning on looking at the pressure relief valves this week but
am not too sure what to be looking for? Also know Aircooled.net rents a
resurfacing tool for these valves, anyone know how it works?
