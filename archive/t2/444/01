Subject: Heater straight pipe

Great and powerful list,

I need to replace my straight pipe that runs up the middle of the bus. I
have kicked around several options and was wondering if anyone had any
advice  or ideas on the subject?

The bus is 74 Westy. Any input would be most appreciated.........

Thanks,
