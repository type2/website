Seth,
Go rent, borrow, beg, for a syphon, pressure, or gravity feed gun, and
apply a decent coat of zinc rich,, self etchng primer.
You've gone this far--why waste your labors with spray bomb ca-ca do
nothing, no build primer.

90 percent of the work is in the prep--and your about ready to blow the
whole deal with some jippo materials.
My advise is --don't do it--

Media blast the nooks and crannies--
Then prime.

Youcan buy a Astro BInks # 7 look alike, will getthe job done for about
$29.95---paint the Bus and throw it away--
An air brush ain't going to cut the mustard--it's way too small of a
tool. 

Later,

Terry

I am in the process of painting my 76 Westy that was completely stripped
of every removable thing including the paint right down to the metal
everywhere on the bus. Any body out there done this before? I am having
trouble getting all surfaces (knooks/crannies) right now I am putting on
some primer (Zero Rust) by spray can. I have been told to buy both a
airbrush and a detail paint gun. Any suggestions?
