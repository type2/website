Thanks again, Richard.  I put it back backwards.

On the dash lights not working, the only thing that I could find loose was
the ground wire on the brake light switch on the emergency brake.  Hooked it
up and the lights are back on.  Since you told me which wire fed the dash
lights, I was able to route and hook up the light in the radio, too.
Thanks.

On the ignition switch, I got rid of the temporary switch that I'd installed
and ran the wires to the defunct rear window defroster switch.  Works like a
charm, isn't obvious, and doing that freed up the defroster hot wire for
installing a pair of auxiliary power sockets in the dash just under and to
the right of the glove compartment knob.

Now one of these days I need to order a plastic glove compartment liner from
Ron.  It's a bit hollow in there without the liner.
