HI Chris,
	Re understeer. 
	I understand that the factories would rather you hit something
straight on, where various crumple zones, airbags, etc. are optimized in
modern cars, rather than sideways or backwards where the outcome is not so
well understood.  Not much of this optimization applies to earlier Type
2's, therefore backing into the wall may well be the preferred option ;)

The factories (I'm told) lean towards understeer to satisfy their 
non-technical driving customers who apparently find over steering more 
scary than sliding straight forward. I like neutral handling myself.
