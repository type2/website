Subject: I am REALLY stumped now!

I posted earlier about the headlights that will work
only when the ignition switch is in the OFF position.
I followed the wiring diagrtam and everything looks
good. ALL other lights work as they should including
turn signals and parking lights. The parking lights
work with the key on, but not the damn headlights.
WTF?!?!?!?! Anybody have any clue why this could be??
