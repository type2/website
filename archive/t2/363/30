This info is based on an old suspension book I have.

Not much of an expert but wouldn't having the engine in the rear pretty much
make the handling  of a bus completly differant than a traditional front
engine car as far as oversteering and understeering go? Like swinging a
hammer almost. All the real weight is further from the pivot piont or front
tires. Does this make any sense or am I just to tired from work?

Hmmmmm...? CHAD
