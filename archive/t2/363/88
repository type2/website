Subject: New Suspension Book

Hi All,
  Has anyone seen a pre-release copy of the book How to Modify Volkswagen 
Bus Suspension, Brakes and Chassis for High Performance
by James Hale?  The Barnes and Noble website says it's supposed to be 
released on April 28, and I'm just wondering if it has any useful 
information that hasn't been discussed on this group.

Later!
