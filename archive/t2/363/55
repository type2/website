Hello All   Even if the battery was hooked up backwards it still shouldn't 
spark. It will even run, signals wont work right and it would blow anything 
with a dieode in it,. The way it was described there is a wire shorting out. 
check the main battery to starter wire and also the wires from the coil to 
the choke and idle solenoid.  Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  salem Import
