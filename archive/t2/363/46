this is not a good thing. Did you confirm you hooked the battery up
correctly? IIRC the correct battery for busses has the terminals
reversed from what many people cary as replacements, so when placed in
the tray the correct terminals are not on the right side. Double check
those wires.

No it should be a 12V last 6V busses were split windows in 66. I'm not
sure what you might have fried, but smoke is what makes electrical
devices work, & you released it to the wild :)
