Subject: ADMIN Re: [T2] FS on eBay: Idle Stabilizer valve and Control

As most of you are aware, we took a public vote recently and as a result E-Bay auctions continue to NOT be permitted on the type2 list.  Sean, please do not post any more of your auctions here.

Thanks,
        -David (type2 list admin)
