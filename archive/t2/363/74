Subject: rear lug nut question

Hi All.
I need to get new lug nouts for the rear of my 81
Westy.
Here is my question.
The part number I got from my parts list is N 020 112
1.
On the Bus Depot web site I found 2 different numbers
for the rear lug nuts and neither is the number I got
from my parts list.

N 20 112 1 Wheel Lug Nut, 71-79 Bus, Rear and 80-91
Vanagon Rear or Syncro Non-Alloy Wheels
And 
N 201 121 Lug Nut, 71-79 Bus, 80-92 Vanagon Rear
Does nayone know what the difference is between the 2
Bus Depot has they are both the same cost, $1.25 each.

Also I need a new Throttle body to Plenum Gasket VW#
022 133 073A.
I can't find anyone that has it any ideas.
