Subject: Re: [T2] Vaccum leak near manifold

Steve:

I once though I had a leak in the air distribution box (that's what you're
talking a picture of) by carefully listening with a tube stuck in my ear,
just like you did.  Only, there *wasn't* any leak in the air distribution
box.  It's very difficult to locate leaks precisely by hearing alone as
you're dealing with a noisy environment right where a lot of air *is* moving
rapidly.  I'd suggest this:

1) remove the air intake elbow and air filter and carefully inspect the air
intake elbow for cracks and leaks.
2) if the air intake elbow is OK (or not, but you've fixed it) put it back
into place and plug up the end where the air filter attaches.  (I've found
that the large cap off my wife's big detergent bottle, wrapped with a little
tape, fits perfectly.)
3) plug up the tail pipe.  (A different cap in my case; use a potato or
whatever.)
4) unhook the hose running from the aux air regulator to the air intake
elbow at the air intake elbow end, plug up the hole in the air intake elbow
(a cork) and attach the hose to your air compressor or find a friend that's
willing to act like an air compressor by blowing into the hose.  (The engine
has to be cold or air won't pass into the air distribution box.)
5) mix a little detergent with some water in a spray bottle and start
spraying/swabbing soapy water at all the spots where you suspect a leak,
with your air compressor running.
6) look for bubbles.
