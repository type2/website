Subject: Old pistons-rebuilt head?

Good day!
Thanks for the heating tips for the pistons pin!!! (I had forgot about 
this one), they went out like knife in butter.

Diagnostic:
-All pistons removed, no scratch on side wall what so ever (pistons and 
cylinders)
-Some slight carbon deposit between top of pistons and first compression 
ring (side).
-All rings are within spec, side play in groove & gap when in the 
cylinder. Rings looks very nice! No carbon deposit, still very flexible.
-Carbon deposit removed from top of pistons (90.82mm).
-Side play of crankshaft/rods .25/.30mm (max wear.40) on all 4
-Camshaft is beautiful, no pitting on the lobe, nice color.
-All lifter (solid) looks fine, no pitting what so ever.
-Pistons diameter 90.80 /90.82 average (micrometer)
-Not able/equipped to check the total wear between pistons and cylinders
-No oil consumption before I remove the head & pistons, no blow by either.

I don't believe in head rebuilt (VW) but I don't have any choice, no new 
1.7 heads available.

Am building a 2.0L for next summer (case/core is almost done), my money 
goes there. So I want to put my bus back in the road for this summer 
with my 1.7 configurations, if possible, I want to use the same pistons 
and cylinders for this summer. Heads are being rebuilt right now, the 
guys as 25 years experience in Flat-4. Out of 11 heads (Thanks to all) 
we took the 2 best one, 1 was basically new. The other one is in really 
good shape (Thanks Mik). My guy vouches for those head!  (New valves, 
springs, guide, new adjusting screws, seats cut & fly cut)

The problems: in my motorcycle engine experience, new rebuild (fly cut) 
head(s) = high compression = rings failure. For sure motorcycle rev at 
12000rpm. I could lower the compression ratio???

Other problems: Like I said before, I am stuck with a single prog Weber 
(New), if possible, I don't want to tune this carb with brand new 
pistons & cylinder! (I will tune this carb!!!)
I think that they are still pretty good (pistons & Cyl).

Of course I will check compression after I put back the heads and before 
I put back all the rest, if to low, I will put new cyl. & pistons. 
(compression was 122psi at #1, 0psi all others)

What is your experience! Any real advises!
Cheers, Ben
