Buddy of mine lost a nice autostick this way when the loser shop he took it too failed to clamp his fuel lines.

He tried to fight it with flour as he was parked in front of a restaurant supply store. Not successful.

Make sure your extinguisher is rated for B & C
B = flammable liquids
c = live electrical equipment
