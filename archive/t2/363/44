Hi!

This is my first post to the Type 2 list.  I just bought a 1970 Bus [Black and
Red two-tone, with flames on the front], and I can't get it started.  Here's
the deal:

-The PO [Previous Owner] says that it always started up fine.
-The battery was dead when I first tried to start it.
-I installed a new battery [12 Volt]
-When I installed the ground lead to the battery, there were a whole lot of
sparks, and there was a considerable amount of smoke coming from around the
alternator/carburetor section of the engine.
-The bus still won't start

Is it possible that I put a 12V battery in a 6V system?  Keep in mind that
this is my first VW, and I'm much more accustomed to working on old Mopar
Slant Sixes.  If I fried something...what would it be?  I basically just need
some advice that will help be troubleshoot the problem...and yes, I'm going to
Napa tonight to order the Haynes manual.

Thanks,
Matt Cappeluti
