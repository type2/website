Mike,

You have *not* been paying attention!!!  Replace *ALL* of
the fuel lines...NOW!

Sorry for the yelling, but that's before Chris or one of the other guys
gets ahold of you....his mission in life is to make sure everyone replaces 
their old fule hoses now!!!

You might as well add a *good* fire extinguisher to your list
of needed parts as well.

Don't wait, do it!

Glad that you didn't burn, dave
