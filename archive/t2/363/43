Since you cant be sure your pulley is the same as the guys who wrote
this....

The least error prone way I would think of with primative tools
would be to measure the actual diameter with a tape measure
then for 30 degrees
(diameter/360) x 30   which is     diameter / 12

measure that length around the circumference from TDC
Make sure you are at TDC not every pulley is marked the same

You could use a protractor but youd have to find the real center and
project the lines out
this seems like it would be more error prone.
