Just be sure whatever wrench you use, that the rubber gasket inside
the socket holds the sparkplug securely...Otherwise, it's magnet-on-
a-stick time to fish it out of the cooling fins...;-( >>
 
Mine does have the rubber inside, however, during one tune-up a few years back 
it didn't prevent the plug from falling out. Scraped the h**l out my knucles 
getting it out of there.
