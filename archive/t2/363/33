Richard,

Had that problem with my socket too...I grabbed my favorite stuff(3m 
weatherstrip glue) and just glued it back in...I don't think it
has ever come back out with a spark plug again.

Shameless plug for yellow weatherstrip adhesive!  LOL

Cheers, dave

I bought a crasftsman spark plug socket and I found that the rubber inside gripped the plug to much and the socket stayed with the plug when I tried to pull it out. I eventually found a better fitting regular socket and put the rubber piece inside and tailored it to my needs. With the engine tin in place the 6-sided top that most spark plug sockets have doesn't really come use anyway.
