Just be sure whatever wrench you use, that the rubber gasket inside
the socket holds the sparkplug securely...Otherwise, it's magnet-on-
a-stick time to fish it out of the cooling fins...;-( >>
 
Mine does have the rubber inside, however, during one tune-up a few years 
back 
it didn't prevent the plug from falling out. Scraped the h**l out my knucles 
getting it out of there.

I've got an expensive neodymium magnet on a cheap wand for that. The magnet
was from a wrecked speaker and it'll pull a sparkplug out of any of the nooks
and crannies... ;-) Also great for picking up a jar or can of spilled nuts 
and 
bolts...
