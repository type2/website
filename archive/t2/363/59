Subject: Vaccum leak near manifold

Hello,

I can hear a leak in the manifold near the air intake, but does not seem to
be coming from the gasket.  It seem to be coming from the manifold - See
Picures: http://filebox.vt.edu/users/sselin/pics/vaccum_leak.htm

I used a tube as a stethescope and am pretty sure that's where I am hearing
the leak.  Anyone have experience with this.

The vaccum is only at 8" and there are no other big leaks that are obvious.

If the leak is on the manifold, can I patch it, or do I need a new part?

Thanks
Steve
