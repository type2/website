I'm having a problem with my 83 aircooled Vanagon.  When starting from a
stop it tends to hesitate badly. It is worst when the engine is cold.  I'm
running the stock Bosch fuel injection.  I have recently installed new
plugs, wires, condensor, points, distributor cap & rotor, and fuel filter.
Could this possibly be caused by a vacuum leak?  Any help is appreciated.
