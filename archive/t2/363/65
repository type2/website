Subject: How do I get this EGR filter on???

Hi all:

I found a perfectly good EGR filter - probably an aftermarket piece - at a
junkyard.  It still had a "VW" part number written on it in black marker,
which was the same part number as specified for my Federal vehicle.  The
only problem is, it doesn't seem to fit, though I think there must be a way
to "make it" fit.

With the filter installed properly against the engine tin and the tube
leading up to the EGR itself, the lower flange of the filter misses its
mating flange in the crossover pipe by a wide margin.  It looks like the
flange needs to move toward the front of the engine by about 1.5" - 2", down
by about .75", and the flange needs to "rotate" (looking down on the flange
from above) by about 30 - 40 degrees.  This is all a lot more than the usual
little bit of persuasion exhaust pieces typically need and the piece is
sturdy enough I know I can't muster the muscle, with the part in place, to
get things properly aligned.

Any words of wisdom out there on how to get this thing to fit?

TIA.
