Subject: Anybody need a '78 Bus for Parts?

Hi Everybody,

I have a 1978 Bus that I need to get rid of.  I was going to restore it, but
it needed too much to make it smog worthy, so I have it on Ebay right now.
Here's the URL:

It's got a running 2.0L Fuel Injected engine...which runs pretty good, but the
lifters are stuck.

All the glass is good, and all the body panels are straight.

Let me know if you have any questions,

Thanks,
Matt
