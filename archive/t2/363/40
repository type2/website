Subject: Timing Question..I already lookied in archives, I promise

I'm going to check my timing this weekend, I think everything's good, but I
want to check it as part of a tune up, plus I thought if I check it while its
right, it'll be easier for a dumb guy like me. Anyways, here's my question: I
have a 1970 w/ a 1776, dual Kadron's and an 009 distributor. I read that to
find 30 deg BTDC I measure 43mm to the right of TDC. Do I measure a straight
line (point to point) or along the egde (arc) of the pulley?
