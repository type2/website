Subject: Re: [T2] Old pistons-rebuilt head?

IF these heads are as good as you say they are they shouldn't need a
"compression cut" (cut made to clean up damaged contact point of heads to
cylinders) but, if there is any sort of significant compression cut made,
then the rebuilder should give you shims of equal thickness to the amount of
material removed.  Result = no change in compression ratio.

That said, I think the only safe thing to do with older/remanufactured heads
is to CC the heads, measure the deck height, and calculate the compression
ratios directly.
