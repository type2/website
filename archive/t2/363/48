Mike,

No problem on the nice and level<grin>...yes, I have 5 vw's and every one
of them has a fire extinguisher in it....and a large one in the garage.

I didn't always have that many vw's(lucky to have just one) and I have
had 2 fires in a 67 bus...first one was because the brass connector
at the carb fell out and the other was because a rod went thru the 
top of the case at about 4,000 rpm.  I managed to "blow"(yeah,stupid)
both of the fires out and not burn anything but spark plug wires.

Had a buddy that worked on a bus he was going to sell at the Eureka
show a couple of years ago that burned it to the ground on the way over.

He has fire extinguishers in all his vehicles, but missed that one cause 
he was on his way to sell it....

Believe me, I know about shoestrings(and worse).

Cheers, dave
