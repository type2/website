Oops, I lied.  Unintentionally.

I tied the radio into the gray/red wire where it comes off of the light
switch.  The Emergency Flasher (the illumination light, not the one that
flashes) is on the end of the same wire, and both the radio and EF lights
are working and respond to the dimmer.

But the instrument lights are still out.  So I'll be looking for a loose
ground tomorrow.  I also picked up some spare bulbs.

Stopped at the Post Office today and the fuel pump (add-on electric) simply
died.  Got a friend to take me back by the house and found that the
after-market pump in the Sentra was the same exact pump.  30 minutes later
we were rolling again.  New pump will be added the list of spare parts to be
carried in the future.

Replaced all of the fuel line from the pump to the carb.  The line between
the final filter and the carb was dry rotted, so maybe the pump going out
was God looking out for us.

Apparently the old pump was shot for some time, because "G" is running 100%
better.  And you can't hear the new pump.  The old one was audible almost
over the sound of the engine, but I didn't take that into consideration
because the other pump was a bit loud in the Sentra.  Added a filter between
the tank and the pump, and there's already one between the pump and the
carb.

What I didn't realize was that the Sentra had the pump mounted on the
firewall and the sound transmitted straight through into the cabin.  With
the bus' fuel tank compartment and the insulated hatch with my tools on top
of it, the pump should have been almost silent compared to the Sentra.

One learns.
