You're yelling at the "Paranoid Safety Guy".  Don't.  Speak politely in a
level voice.

I have paid attention.  I'm also building a business on a shoestring budget
and can't always set aside the bucks to fix and repair the bus, even when it
only involves a few dollars.

Which is why I'm glad that the fuel pump went out yesterday.  It was a good
excuse to do the fuel line thing.  Without the FI, and having a single carb,
there was very little to replace.

You don't have one?  I thought that every good driver carried a fire
extinguisher.  And a first aid kit.
