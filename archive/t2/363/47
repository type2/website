Subject: 14 inch versus 15 inch

Hi All,
Another problem I have run in to - I can't find a  14-inch wheel/rim for my
bus - I just discovered that I had three 14-inchers and one 15-inch which
was why it was riding unevenly.   I am running the two 15s on the front as I
cannot find a 14 incher - yet.  The 15s are all over the place.  Would it
hurt my bus if I  used all 15s instead?

Thanks

Susan
