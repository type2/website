Junkyard exhaust parts are dubious in my experience for the very reasons you site below.

I think you'll have to come up with a unique solution for the parts you have. Have a mallet?

First, be careful: the tin is the weak point and it will want to bend there and tear a hole in the tin.  I've found that you have to tighten up the whole system slowly. If you do one flange at a time you'll get in the situation you are in now and pieces will seem to be totally ill fitting. They make not fit perfectly but they will appear to fit worse at first.

The pipe from the valve to the engine tin doesn't always have the flanges bent to the correct offset. Make sure that piece is lying flat without the need for assitance from the nuts holding it down or it will want to twist the filter.

What I do it start with the filter and use some bolts at the tin to keep it in place. Bend the tubes until you get a good fit without bolting it up tight. Do the same thing for the EGR pipe to the valve. Then you can tighten it up slowly.

I really despise that whole system. Good luck.
