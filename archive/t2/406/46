Last time I did this (here in Texas) it was $49/day for the truck and $0.59/mile, plus gas of course.  If you get a diesel you will get maybe 8-9mpg, which sounds bad until you consider that the gas version gets 6mpg.  You will probably pay an additional charge for making a one-way trip.

I agree with the person who said spend the money to fix the bus instead - it will be cheaper than towing.
