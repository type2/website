When I had these symptoms I checked the wire that goes from the coil to the 
solenoid and wire pulled out of the crimped terminal at the coil.
The wire strands were coated in oil and making intermittent connection and 
causing resistance in the circuit causing the solenoid to only partially engage.
The voltage can read fine one moment and low the next.
Fiddleing with the connections would solve the problem temporarily.
