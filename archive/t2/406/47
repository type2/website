It was said::

>>
<<  the guy said that someone drove it up from myrtle beach and left it 
there
or something of that nature...
told me he just wants to get rid of it and get it out of his parking lot....
i myself and i dont know much about buses would not pay over say hmmmm 350
-400 bucks for it.. he might take it....?

vin # 2282055003
  >>

And more said::

>>But does it have a "clean" bill of sale/title...?


And it was researched::

from  http://www.type2.com/library/identifi/vin.htm  :


1978 Chassis# 218 2000 001 Engine# GE 0 007 083


1968 Chassis# 218 000 001 Engine# B 5 000 001


and it was concluded::

<<  OK, clean title on a '68 should have a VIN that starts 2 2 8 0, not 2 2 
8 2.  And total digits should be 9, not 10..


and it was theorized::

Could this be a '78??  And have the pancake porsche engine, as the MAN 
says??

What kind of bumper (if any) were on the VW,

and/or tail lights

and/or wheels rims

and/or steering wheel

and/or color of speedo

and/or glove compartment lid

and/or position of front turn signals

and/or color of bezel on marker reflectors

and/or type of wind shield wiper arms

and/or type of front seats (head rests??  Slide or pop out passenger seat??)

and/or  what was the first four VIN numbers on the dash
and/or the door jam
and/or the engine compartment raised lip (left side)
