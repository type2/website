Yes!!  Does anyone know of any sites about off-roading a bus. This is why I 
just
bought my ' 79 (besides the fact I just always wanted one). I want to rig it 
for
driving in the desert. Besides cooling mods that are on the drawing boards. 
does
anyone know anything about adding cab accuated air shocks in the back for 
more clearance on tougher parts of the road. This is my daily driver, also 
(anyone want a
' 83 RX7?), I've heard and seen some pictures of "Baja Buses" before. Any one
know where some info might be?
