Tony,

It is *not* illegal...not even technically.  It is a 19xx vehicle that has 
been completely restored in the full sense of the word.

Title is the same as the pan....just cause you dropped a new car on top of 
it doesn't matter to the gubment.  

Insurance wise, it should be the same as for any of our **restored**
vehicles.  After I drop that much money on a bus and expect to get it 
insured for replacement cost, it's going to take an appraiser and the 
right insurance company...and money.

Cheers, dave
