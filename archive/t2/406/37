---yeah i dint think about that you could call u haul and ask how much they
would rent you a small truck and a tow dolly for ...?(good idea Brad)---


Its a rip off to go the uhaul route unless its not to far of a haul. After
truck and dolly rental you gotta pay the gas bill to. The truck they make you
rent is HUGE, so gas milage bites. I speak this from experience. (Those at
Dead of Winter at Cloudland Canyon,GA will remember) Check SAMBA for a car
hauler I had a friend doing it for a while but he drives the big rigs now. You
can also ship it. A good friend of mine just had one shipped from Somewhere up
north to central AL. It wasn't to expensive. Just a few Ideas!!
