Subject: RE: Access a reality?

Seann has asked:

>  When prepping a late model bay (i.e. removal of old paint) what is the 
>best
way to access the visible body surface inside the air intake for the engine
compartment? . . .  Are chemical strippers and bead blasters my only option 
to get to this?

Seann, this question has infrequently come up in the past, so little that it 
could not  be classified as a FART.  More like an   IFART  .  or was that U 
? ?

Popular suggestions:

1.  Hire someone with tiny hands and tiny wrists that want to do something 
really ridiculous.

2.  Hire someone with   L O N N G G G G   arms to get up the airway from the 
engine compartment.

3.  Hire someone with a 30,000 PSI deck washer (non-abrasive, until you gte 
one of them laid across your back!! )

4.  Hire someone with imagination and patience to apply the proper cleaners 
and bleaches and strippers with a stick apparatus.  Ask if any list vendor 
sells such an item, and that the stick does not have a VWofA indicia.


5.  Hire someone . . .  who has done this before on an EARLY bay..


[no, I'm not going to sign this, 'cause I'll just get a lot of nasty 
emails...]
