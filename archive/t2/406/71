Hi Volks- We need donations to keep the list operating more than 6 months.
Donations have fallen off during the past year and we have enough money for
the next 5 months.  The last fund drive was many moons ago when we needed
new equipment. The monthly expenses for our ISP and bank fees are $160.00; a
bargain considering the bandwidth we use.

Donations have almost kept up with expenses.. The economy has slowed those
donations to almost nil, so we are operating now from our reserve. DONATIONS
OF ANY AMOUNT ARE GREATLY APPRECIATED. Those $5.00 and $20.00 donations have
kept the list going for a long time. Please send any amount your can.

If you'd like to send a check, make it payable to "Type2 Fundraiser" and
mail it to the treasurer:
