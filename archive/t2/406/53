Congrats on the new westy. Converting it to 4 wheel drive would be a huge 
undertaking, however I have seen it done on a split window bus. They used 
the drive train and chasis from a 4 wheel drive truck and basicaly put the 
split window on top of that.

There are vanagons that are 4 wheel drive, they are called Syncos. For the 
money to molest your bus into 4 wheel drive you could probably buy a nice 
Syncro.
