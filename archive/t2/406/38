Subject: pics of sam's 77 westy

Hi all kinda want to introduce myself and say if anyone needs tech help on 
paint and body on a bus they can e-mail me direct. I have restored a few buses 
now and have a 71 in the works not to mention my own 67 westy, but here is a 
link to a bus I did for Sam in Atlanta  <A HREF="http://homepage.mac.com/sam.nickerson/PhotoAlbum1.html">Click here: Sam's 77 Westy</A>
