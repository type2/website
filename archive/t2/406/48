>I need to replace acouple of exhaust studs on a 1973 1700CC head.  The reason I need to replace them is that the holes in the head are stripped.  I am looking fot a stud that is 8 mm on one end and 10 mm on the other.  I have found them for the Beetle engine but those are too short.  Do they make them for the Bus engine. 

The longer ones are hard to find.  I got mine at Harloff Import Parts in La Mesa, Ca.  They should be in the book.  They will still not be as long as the stock studs, but they will work.  Make very sure that you tap the hole straight.
