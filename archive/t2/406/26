But does it have a "clean" bill of sale/title...?
Just because 'somebody left it' doesn't give
the property owner the right to sell it; call
the police and have it impounded, probably
yes...I went through an interstate donny-
brook over a car I lost the title to and
wouldn't want to do it again. Even if the
property owner has a title, I'd get it searched
before I put down any money...There's al-
ways the chance the guy who left it
wasn't the owner...
