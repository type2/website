In TN it required a state VIN check, inspection by police officer, wait of 
several months and then they would give a title. Seems like there was a 
period where the original owner could reclaim the vehicle at no cost to me.

Did this with a Hyundai Excel I traded for. At the last minute the owner 
sent me the title as agreed. I did all the work to get a new title but at 
the last minute got the original title. What a HEADACHE!

I would never do this again unless I was parting out the carcass (done this 
to car I bought with no title) and disposing of the remains in the recycle 
bin - piece by piece courtesy of a Sawz-All.
