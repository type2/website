 Not trying to start an argument, just curious if the value of a 19xx
Beetle is close enough to $11, 500 to get paid by an insurance co.
in case of an accident...I'm slightly familiar with 'agreed or declared'
value policies, but even then, I'm not positive about the limitations
on the value...i.e. you can't insure to a huge sum and then leave the
keys in it on the dark side of town and hope...
And again, some policies on restored vehicles carry restrictions...
Mileage, other drivers, etc. that can make a MexiBeetle restoration
solely a garage queen.
Like I said, I was curious what anyone who actually had one did with it.
