Tony,

Yep, one of the guys in our local club has had one for at least 2 years 
and there was a guy around town that was trying to sell some for awhile.
The only complaint from the guy who bought it was that it seemed sort of 
"gutless".


For most vw folks, the $11,500 price is a bit steep unless you look at it 
as a "new car"....which it mostly is.  They sure do look nice with 
metallic paint though.

I talked to the guy trying to sell them here and basically, they take
a/your pan and strip it, paint it and then put *everything* from the new
one on/in it.  If i remember correctly, they even put new pans on 
it.....

From torsion bars out. 


Cheers, dave
