Subject: Exhaust Stud Replacement

The stock studs were 8mm on one end and 9mm on the business end. They were
perhaps 102mm or 108mm long, but this is from memory,
I can't remember.

An east coast supplier was Unimetric in New Jersey, but they may be long
gone. Try Metric Man in Santee, CA, they may still be in business.
If all else fails try Industrial Fastener? or Warwick Fastener in  Warwick
Rhode Island.
