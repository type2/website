Seann,

Liberal use of clorox and car wash hi pressure spray.

You can get your hand part way in there from the bottom...depends on how 
much engine/battery is out and how you lay on your back to do it<grin>.

Generally the paint guys have a hard time getting it painted in
any way decent....maybe Terry will chime in here...

Chemical strippers may be pretty much it, but if the paint guys
have a hard time getting it back on then,.....<shoulder shrug>

Cheers, dave
