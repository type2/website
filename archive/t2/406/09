The flexible stainless steel exhaust tubing I used to join the type1 engine
heater boxes to the paper/aluminum flexible air hoses (that join to the
fan housing) can be found here:

I used the anti-magnetic T-304, since it costs only slightly more, but has
better rust resistance.  The size you want is the 2" ID.  I found that a metal
chop saw from Harbor Freight makes the required cuts quickly and neatly.
Otherwise a hacksaw will do the job (eventually).  Cleaning up the knife
edges with a file will cut down on band-aid(tm) usage.
