with the tow my little toyota is a hauler:) just pulled my friends bus from 
outside of BOONE to norfolk va with out any problems.I would just ask for 
gas and food and a tow dolly rental (50-70 bucks ). as long as the wife 
doesnt mind me gone for a day or 2. So what part of VA will you be coming

Hello all. I'm in urgent need for someone to help me tow my bus back to 
Virginia. Right now I am in Houston Texas and i can't get my bus back to
Virginia. 
The bus won't make such a long trip  by herself. I can't afford the cost
of a 
transportation service to have my bus shipped back to Virginia and I
don't 
have a truck or trailer so I am in quite a hard place. Im moving back to
Virginia 
on the 27th of this month and I'm franticlly trying to find a way to get
her 
back home. Can anybody help me out? I can provide cash for gas and some
money 
for your efforts. I can't afford much because I'm a very broke college
student 
but i can probably afford between $300-$400. Thank you very much for any

help! Fare thee well-Evan
