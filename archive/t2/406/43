Subject: Intake Manifold Stud

List,
I think (hope) I may have found my problem.  I have a '72 with a single solex carb setup.  I was experiencing loss of power, coughing and sputtering after driving about 10 blocks.  I changes the fuel filter and repaired a damaged wire between the coil and the carb (choke?), some improvement, but still not right.  I stuck my head in there and noticed the nut attached to the stud on the right front intake manifold was loose.  I tightened it down only to have the entire stud come loose.  The guy at the FLAPS told me to try applying some lock-tight, replace the stud and then tighten.  The stud didn't show any signs of stripping.  Is it possible for that stud to come loose without stripping either the stud or the head?  Will lock -tight work for this application?  How long does it take for lock-tight to set?  And finally, will a loose intake manifold cause symptoms of loss of power, coughigng, hesitation etc.?
 
If I can't get a good connection there, I will pull the carb off and try to tap a bigger hole (with engine in) and replace.  I may end up pulling the engine to make sure I get everything lined up properly if that is what it will take.
 
Any insight appreciated.
Thanks,
