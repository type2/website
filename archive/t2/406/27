Subject: Exhaust Stud replacement

I need to replace acouple of exhaust studs on a 1973 1700CC head.  The reason I need to replace them is that the holes in the head are stripped.  I am looking fot a stud that is 8 mm on one end and 10 mm on the other.  I have found them for the Beetle engine but those are too short.  Do they make them for the Bus engine.  Any help would be appreciated.  Kevin
