Hello Ron    You are welcomed. Now let me ask have you if you have done 
anything to suport the Type 2 list,  any donations as I see that Tedebare just 
posted saying the list needs money, and I feel that there are a bunch of vendors 
posting and wondered if they are supporting us in return . I know that there 
are a bunch of the Full Moon campouts that donate, Everybus, Naturalbus(Which I 
help sponser) and High Country all have given money to the lists. I personally 
donate each year a small amount even thu I don't usually advertise on the 
list. Just wondering  Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service
