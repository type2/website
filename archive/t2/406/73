Subject: The New BusDepot.Com - Now OPEN for Business! 

I just threw the switch on the New BusDepot.com website.   It's still
got a few rough edges, but if I wait until it's perfect it will be
another year.  Even as it stands, I think it's a huge improvement over
the old one (and, for that matter, pretty much any other VW parts site).
It now forwards automatically from www.busdepot.com .

As I mentioned during the beta test period, there are a number of
improvements with the new site:

- A selection of nearly 200,000 parts - the industry's largest. (See
below.) 
- More product information - click on the "I" icon for diagrams, color
swatches, etc.
- Over 1000 pictures/images (and counting)
- Completely new Context Sensitive search engine. This is really neat,
and easy to use!
- Want List - you can create and store lists of parts you will need for
future projects
- Direct Order by Part Number (i.e. from our catalog)
-  Greatly expanded Help and Links pages 
- Coupon Code feature for listmembers. (See below.)

The biggest change is that we've increased the parts database from about
15,000 parts, to roughly 200,000 - making BusDepot.com literally the
largest online consumer VW parts database on the planet.  We've combined
the complete product databases from a number of importers and
wholesalers, plus nearly the whole TMI catalog, and almost every
"dealer" part as well. Some data has still yet to be entered, but even
now, it's probably safe to say that you're more likely to find a part on
BusDepot.com than anywhere else. 

Yes, this means that BusDepot.com now lists a full line of Volkswagen
CAR parts as well (at our usual deep discounts). While our focus is and
will remain Busses and Vans, there were some logical reasons for
expanding to VW cars. About half of you also own a VW car, and we often
get inquiries from list members as to whether we can get them comparable
discounts on a part for their Ghia, Jetta, etc.  We've always been able
to, since many of our sources do stock them. So we decided to offer them
to our existing customer base.  This is a win/win situation. Since we're
already dealing with these suppliers anyway, it doesn't dilute our
Bus/Van efforts. But the added volume does give us a lot more clout with
them.  Which means we can negotiate sharper prices, and demand better
availability and quality, on the Bus/Vanagon/Eurovan parts that are the
core of our efforts (and our enthusiasm).  Like I said, win/win. So
please remember BusDepot.com next time you need a part for your "other
VW." 

The other news is that you now have a Listmember Coupon Code. This will
be changed from time to time, but for now it's LIST1E.  Entering this in
the referral code field on the "view shopping cart" will cause your 5%
listmember discount to be automatically applied. The same restrictions
as before apply: Minimum $50 purchase, excluding made to order and
special order items, engines/transmissions/rebuilt heads, gift
certificates, tax, shipping, sale items, and orders to which any other
discount is applied. Most of these will automatically be filtered by the
coupon code, but sale items (denoted by a yellow bin on the site, for
Bargain Bin) will not. These will not qualify for the discount, and if
the coupon code applies one it will be adjusted upward prior to
shipping.

While the beta testing period is over, I still have a list as long of my
arm of stuff to finish. And there is probably ten times more that I
haven't even found yet. Please send me any/all bug reports, mistake
reports, complaints, comments, suggestions, ideas, criticisms.  I really
want this to be the best VW parts site out there and personally read and
act on every email.

For all of you Beta Testers, I haven't forgotten you. I greatly
appreciate your very valuable input and will be e-mailing you
individually within the next few days.

Thanks again for all your support!!!!!
