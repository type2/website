Poured the molds for the production mold of the sliding door inner handle
(w/cap), the remainder of the key fob parts, and some other VW-related odds
& ends tonight along with some molds for other clients.

If things go well, the mold for the handle will be completed and ready for
the first production run by Friday.  The red/blue heater levers will be
next, closely followed by the other items in the picture at our website.

To date, we have 24 VW bus-related projects either in progress or in some
stage of development or research.  Cool. :O)

The latest was for round rubber-topped keys.  I'm casting a resin key blank
(the bus key with the offset top piece, like my own) in order to experiment
with a few designs.  It'll most likely be something that can be permanently
attached to the top of existing key(s).

Thanks to those who have/are sending bus bits to us, and thanks to all for
the encouragement!
