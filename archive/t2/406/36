Subject: Re: [T2] an urgent Cry for help!

what is wrong with your bus ? There are alot of great VW people out in Texas
and alot offering help from the A.I.R.S. list. If you have 300-400 dollars,
you may be able to fix the problem and drive your baby to where ever. It is
a better alternative and you will get the joy of driving your bus across
country.
