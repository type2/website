I've just got back from stripping a '72 Bus that was on a flat bed
hauler...I saw the Bus sitting at a light and gave chase in mine. A
couple of blocks later, the driver stopped at a small junkyard and
I asked what was gonna happen to the Bus. The driver said it was
going directly to the crusher, but for $20, I could have anything
I could get off while he went inside and did the paperwork.
Seats
Lenses
Rubber mats
A box of misc. parts that was in the Bus
Twenty-two minutes...

Sadly, I 'could' have had the whole thing for $100, but no
title and both rear wheels didn't turn so there was no
way to get it 'up' my driveway to my backyard...The 
flatbed would never fit...(we've tried before with other
vehicles...)
