You don't say exactly what makes you feel the bus won't make it.  Does it run?  Are you in a hurry?  IMO if at all possible, consider spending the 
money on repairs (before or as you go) -- you'll not only get to drive the bus on a memorable road trip, but you'll have a better running bus when you 
get there.   Muir talks about starting trips with a marginal bus, taking tools and spares, and ending the trip with a better running car.

Take the AIRS list with you, maybe even contact a few people on it ahead of time.

Just a thought....
