Usually in a reserve system there are two pickups going into the tank. The normal one is higher than the reserve and when you have to switch it's because the fuel level dropped below one but not the other.

All bay window gas tanks are junkyard finds. Veng was the last maker of the aftermarket tank and I don't think Klokkerholm makes them using the tooling they bought up. Ken at <www.thebusco.com> lists tanks of various model years in his inventory.

All of the tanks I've seen at the CA junkyards have been punctured from below and drained. This brings a tear to my eye everytime I see one. One time I thought they hadn't poked a hole and pulled the tank only to find the hole in another place.

When I was out at Pick-n-pull at Moss Landing it didn't look like they were stabbing holes in the tanks but I didn't get a close enough look before it had rained the day before and the ground was flooded under the busses. I shook the bus and hear gas in the tank but I don't know what the environmental policy is out there. All of the junkyards in town have to puncture the tanks.

Put a wanted ad up on Samba and check the old for sale ads for a seller that didn't find a buyer.
