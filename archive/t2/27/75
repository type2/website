Subject: Help!!!!!!

	Hello all....I have a '78 type2 with 2.0FI......The problem is that the
dashboard is not in place and none of the wiring up front is connected.
Nothing to the fuse box, steering column, or anything.  The wiring at the
back of the bus is connected correctly, just the front connections need to
be made.  Its a mess and I don't know where to start to get the wiring
sorted and connected.  Can anyone help??????  Thanks everyone.
