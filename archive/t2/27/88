Subject: clutch feels different

Just finished putting the motor back in after replacing Gen, starter, and
Voltage regulator in my 71.  Engine started right up and ran great, but
while backing out of garage, reverse didn't engage until the last second,
and the clutch felt tight.  I drove it around the block, and it was shifting
"diffferent".  Smooth, but later than normal.  It just didn't feel right.  I
backed off the wing nut a couple of turns, and it seemed to help a little.
I've got a small amount of free-play at the pedal.

This is the first time I've pulled the motor on this bus in two years, and
the clutch was replaced back then.  Everything appears fine, and I didn't
smell any burning.  Just wondering if this was to be expected, or what?
