Subject: Re: [T2] Seat Belts

Be careful when in the wrecking yards shopping for seat belts. The ones 
that have been in an accident are ruined and unsafe.

One thing we looked at when investigating accidents (I was an MP in the 
Navy) for curiosity's sake was a burn mark where the loop that hooks into 
the seat belt latch which melts the material slightly. The stretching and 
shock forces would cause the loop to work on the material at that point 
leaving a 'burn' mark which with the right experience and training 
would/could reveal a good estimate of the speeds involved in the crash.

The material is designed to stretch/give a bit to take some of the shock of 
the accident out and prevent your body from experiencing all the G's which 
could lead to broken bones and internal injuries. With the stretch used up, 
the next accident could be quite bad for you as you get full forces on your 
body.

However - there are companies that can take the hardware and sew in new 
webbing. Check with your local auto upholstery expert.
