I haven't noticed any instabilities up to speeds of 100 mph other than side 
winds doing their thing and an airdamn wouldn't affect that much.  What I have 
noticed is that it takes a LOT more power to run 85 mph than it does to run 65 
mph.  I've got the gearing for it, just not enough umph from my 4 banger.

Honestly, I don't believe an airdamn would improve the aerodynamics of a bus 
enough to make any noticeable difference.  Unless you built a really BIG one 
and covered the whole front of the bus with it (don't forget to leave a clear 
area to see through)  :)
