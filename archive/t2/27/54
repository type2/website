Subject: dumb question

Ok, I know this is going to be a dumb question... but,,,,,, what does AFM
stand for?
Found part of our problem with the 78 Westy, 2.0L FI, thought it had a spun
bearing or something
turns out. the #3 cylinder head sensor was loose, and the distributor cap,
when it was installed
out in Nebraska earlier this summer, the rotor was out of position and the
carbon tip inside the cap had
been "eaten" off and was in little flakes all over the inside of the
distributor.  All is fixed now, except, that it is
still flooding out some so we had to idle it up just a little... runs fine
now.... kind of... was wondering what the AFM is
and wondering if it might be part of the problem...
Thanks
