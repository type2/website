a brand new relay is about $70

one side is wired to the ignition switch, so when the starter is cranked
the fuel pump runs, the other side is wired so that it only has power when
the engine is actually running such as the light for the alt.

thus the ONLY time the fuel pump gets power is either when the starter is
running or when the engine is running.... thus in an accident or stall the
fuel pump shuts off for safety
