Actually, you should have replaced those brands w/ Ural or BMW!!  Not only
rugged and dependable, but aircooled German (ok, the Ural is Rooskie, but
they took the BMW plant back home w/ em after WW2)!

As for the VW comparision, I have NEVER seen a VW that took so much
piddling around with just to get it going as I do the Harley boys. I think
Harley MAKES em a piece of crap just for 'the mystique.'  My roomie built a
BMW outta junk yard frame and used parts, drove it thru Mexico and back a
while ago. No problems. Can't beat that German engineering :)
