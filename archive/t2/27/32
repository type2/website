the Fuel Injection system unique parts  would be

.  ECU
.  AFM
.  injectors
.  cold start valve
.  aux air valve
.  thermo time switch
.  engine temp sensor

but the carbs have

.  complex linkages
.  jets
.  accel pumps
.  choke heaters 
.  chokes
 etc

some things are there but different, but fuel pumps and relays and wiring
harnesses are in even the old 1300 engine splitties
