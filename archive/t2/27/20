Subject: Re: [T2] Anyone Build Their Own Air Dam?

I don't think an air dam would be much more than just a decoration for
you.
Belly pans could be some minor assistance but are a PITA whenever you
work on your van.
I've had air dams on race cars but the cars were only 2 to 3 inches off
the ground at the lowest point of the air dam. On a VW you'd need at
least 8 inches to clear parking stops and such.
I've seen air dams on many domestic conversion vans but most were showing
damage.
Take it on as an experiment and maybe it will be a help but don't expect
too much.
