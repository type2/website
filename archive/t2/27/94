Hey there Tony,

I don't write the ads, I just report them 8-)

Yep, I think you've got it right, 4 forward/one reverse. Could be a
typo or it might be that the seller just doesn't have a clue. At
least they *think* its a manual, probably think it must be like the
honda/toyota/nissan that they drive with a 5 spd. Might be a good
opportunity for a buyer to swoop in and grab a good deal, as the
seller might not know exactly what they've got.

I love seeing some of the ads, like for a 77 "Vanagon". I used to be
confused about the VW bus ads w/ "open depot" in the description, but
I've recently learned that open depot=sunroof, so it's a good thing.
The best ones are the ones that say "Former owner Jerry Garcia". If
Jerry owned half the buses that the advertisers say he owned, he must
have had hundreds of busses in his fleet. Ahh.. Some peoples kids...

Later...
