     OK, here is the deal.  I am still very frustrated with the power =
output of my stock 82 westy.  It just has such a lack of both =
acceleration & top end power.  I am not looking for a rocket ship.  I =
was very content with my 76 westy with the same engine.  Almost all =
hills in the PDX area are 3 gear below 50MPH events.  The van will do =
70MPH but it really does not like it.  65MPH is where it seems to want =
to drive.  I can live with that most of the time.  With my 76, there was =
very few hills around here that I had to downshift for.  65 was the =
norm.  What I am really looking for is some one in the PDX area to come =
& take my van for a drive & compare it to their air-cooled van.  Since =
this is the only Vanagon I have ever had, I have no frame of reference.  =
Let me know what you all think.  Thanks.  BTW, except for the power, I =
love the Vanagon.
