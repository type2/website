Subject: Look at this photo please...

Hey All,
Look at this photo please and tell me if I have one of those after market Deep Oil Sumps on the bottom of the 1600 engine on my '66.  Whenever I do an oil change, I put in the 2.5 quarts of oil and it always reads low on the dipstick. I have always assumed that it was just the wrong dipstick because the engine is a replacement from a '71. The I recently saw a 1500 engine and a 40 HP engine that looked very different on the bottom and it caused me to think (a very dangerous thing!) And if it IS one of these things, how much oils should bo into the 1600? Anway, here's the link  http://www.geocities.com/jbakerccymca/oilsump
Any advice is appreciated.
Thanks & PEACE, John Baker
