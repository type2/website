Subject: Re: [T2] Anyone Build Their Own Air Dam?

<snip>

When the subject of highway stability was addressed here a year or two ago,
a list member from the UK (sorry, I can't remember the name) commented that
an aftermarket air dam on his Bus had a positive effect.

That was me. I have a fibreglass "spoiler" on the front of Ashley and it has
dramatically reduced the sideways movement that is such a "feature" of our
vehicles. Since I last wrote I've made a further improvement which is to cut
a hole in the middle big enough to pass a cable trough should the bus need
to be towed onto a flatbed for recovery. Otherwise you had to remove the
bumper to do this or wreck the spoiler (as me how I know !). The hole is
covered by my front numberplate to keep most of the aerodynamic effect. 

It must work 'cos since I did this I haven't needed a tow (sound of knocking
wood) :-)

I'm suprised its worth the effort of making one as they weren't that
expensive ready made - about 35UKP as I recall. Bought mine from a VW show
vendor so I haven't got an address. Sorry.
