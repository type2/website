Subject: fi to carbs on 78 2.0l??

OK, I'm down to the wire.

All tests from the bently manual prove good except all my injectors, cold
start valve, and pressure regulator are toast from gas turning to
tar(sitting 8 years).  Engine will fire if I dump a little gas in it.

I am looking at about $400+ in fi parts assuming the ecu is
good...although it appears to be.

Anyone have comments about fi to carb conversions...I'm thinking 
maybe dual Weber 34ict?  Anyone moved from a working fi to carbs and have
comments?

Gas mileage and driveability comparisons and comments welcome.

I had a 72 with solexes on it at one time and was *very* happy with
them...I can fix carbs on the side of the road(never had to though)...but
trying to fix fi on the side of the road does not appeal to me....I have
had a borrowed fi camper die on the road after a long camping trip...I was
only 15 miles from home though.

Cheers, dave
