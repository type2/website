Subject: cutting off problem????

Ok last weekend we replaced the push rod tube seals, adj points, valves,
carb and choke on the SnoopyBus (a 73 with an 1800, weber progressive and
Bosh 009) She's been starting up great in the cold and running so much
better.  At least until yesterday. I left work, went over a steep bridge and
then she just wanted to cut off every time I took my foot off the gas.  Had
to either give it gas while I was stopped or just restart when the lights
changed.  Well I let her sit for a while and then when I got back in, no
problems?  I checked the fuel filter and all the connections...nothing wrong
that I could see.  Any Ideas?  I leave for Indigibus
http://www.geocities.com/fullbusmooners/Indigibus.html Tuesday and well be
driving the bus around 2-3000 miles when my vacation is done..  Would like
to figure what might be wrong before I go...

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
