Hi Volks!
  Could it be anything besides the fuel injectors, or
the valves? Spark is getting to the plug. Switched
plugs still loss of power. going to swith fuel
injectors next. Will a good inector squirt gas if
disconnected? How best to check that withouot starting
a fire?
          Thanks
       Al Conliffe
