Subject: Length?

Sorry to ask another weird/stupid question so soon...

Does anyone know the working length of the small rod that connects the
thermostat to the flaps on a 1600 doghouse cooler?  The one I have has been
pretty badly mangled and after straightening (not the 90 degree bend on the
flap end or the slight offset bend by the thermostat) it out it is now too
long. (the thermostat will not fit in the bracket unless the bracket is
totally off it's stud)

Thanks for the help and/or suggestions once again.  I should be back on the
road once I get this and my carb plug figured out...
