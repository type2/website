Subject: Thanks to all.. [T2] fi to carbs on 78 2.0l??

Folks,

Thanks to all who replied!
Here is what I have decided and why.

Responses were about what I expected<grin>.

After finally checking on prices at some of the local VWFLAPS, I have
found that I can buy rebuilt injectors for $38.00...this reduces the
overall price quite a bit, so I will keep the fi.

I have worked on vw's for about 30 years now and have never played with an
fi system.  Since I also have a background in electronics and computers,
the electrical/electronic part doesn't bother me too much.  I have been
thru the Bently book troubleshooting/testing all of the system that I
could except the ecu and it appears to be trying to fire the injectors, so
I figure it will work if the injectors would deliver gas.

I have read the "performance" enhancements outlined in the book on Bosch
fi systems and may try the rising rate pressure regulator at some other
date(after the engine gets rebuilt).

I'll pick up the parts tomorrow afternoon and install them over the
weekend.  

Again, thanks for all of the responses!

Cheers, dave
