I put a post out about a month ago about parts I needed and got one really 
great response but I guess you can say it fell through :(....so once again 
I'm on the search but only for the right rear view mirror and the owners 
manual.

Also, I bought my bus with westy interior (the fold down seat and cabinets), 
but after I took the carpet out I found three holes on the floor that 
something would click into.  I was thinking it is another row of seats, but 
I'm confused.  Did they make vans with the fold down seat and another row of 
seats...or must it be a custom job?  Also..there's a fold down table on the 
side with no door...was that custom?

Muchos Gracias...Tracy
