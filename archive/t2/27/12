Todd,

I would investigate just how fast you would have to be going before it would 
begin to improve the handling of something shaped like a bus.  It could be a 
lot of work for little return.

My forest service road habit and "get there when I do" driving style would 
probably cause me to regret the loss of ground clearance before I'd notice 
any benefits on the highway!
