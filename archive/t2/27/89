Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Anyone Build Their Own Air Dam?

Been running an airdam that was offered by JC Whitny on the front of my ' 78 
Westy for three years now. Looks cool as hell. improved MPG by about 3-4 at 
speeds above 57mph. Brought my running temps down by 5-11deg. f at sustained 
speeds above 50mph., up to 73mph. Well worth the 99.00 paid for it.
