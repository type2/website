????? sounds awfull high, is that just parts or labor too, brand new parts
are less than half that cost from some of the businesses that post here
and used injectors are redily avaliable.  i alway reccomend changing the
cold start valve but that is 74.95 at Rocky Mountain but I paid less than
half that for my last new one.

fuel economy is about the same, but driveability is no where near as good
and it is a lot harder to keep carbs working right

much less likely to  leave you on the side of the road.

bet it was something other than the FI that broke.

I've had both and the learning curve with FI is no harder than carbs but
it is different.  the big difference once you get the FI working you can
almost forget it, just doesn't need all the constant fiddling that carbs
do.
