In the past 7 years I have had two EFI failures that brought me to a halt. 1st
one was a double relay that gave up. 2nd happened on the way to Jerome 2 weeks
ago = lost injector power because of the harness failure. I did not cut the
harness open, just replaced it and the bus runs great. Expensive tow bill from
Barstow to Fresno for that one
