Subject: 81 Vanagon injector/idle problem

Hello to all on the list.

I want to start by thanking you all for those many informative posts
that I've looked up in the archive while I've worked on putting a new
engine in my 81 Vanagon - Westy.  

To say that this has been a bit of a challenge would be a bit of an
understatement. After getting a newly rebuilt engine, I dropped the old
engine and reinstalled the new one with a minimum of difficulty.  Once
I got the engine back together the real problems began.

At first, the fuel injectors were pumping way too much gas into the
engine.  The engine started but ran incredibly rough and would die when
you even tapped the accelerator.  By researching the archives and
working through the Bentley manual, the mechanic helping me and I
finally traced the problem to the cylinder head temperature sensor. The
mechanic put a new one in and the beast ran but was cutting out and
backfiring under load.  We decided that the idle stabilizer was
probably to blame, so I installed a new one. 

Now the engine starts, but will only run if you keep the accelerator
pushed down.  Even then, there is an incredible fluctuation in the
engine rpms.  When you let up on the accelerator, the engine
immediately dies. 

I've researched the archives to try to find a solution to this problem
but haven't found anything that I can compare it to. SO I'm putting out
a plea for help.  Any ideas? Tonight I plan to double check all wiring
connections and vacuum lines to ensure that everyting is okay there.

Since I read the list in digest form, email directly to me will reach
me sooner!

Thanks in advance,

Chuck
