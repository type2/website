Subject: Re: Anyone Build Their Own Air Dam?

A Porsche mechanic in St. Louis retrofitted his bus with a turbocharged 2.7
liter 911 engine.
Given his terminal velocity, he needed an air dam and adapted one from an
old BMW 2002.
Claimed that there's an unstable region between 75 and 85 mph, but that the
bus "feels rocksolid" above that speed.
