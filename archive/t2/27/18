Todd, (and any aerodynamics buffs that might be out there)

It may have a bigger impact on the handling of a lighter weight vehicle.  Is 
there a correlation of sorts or curve between vehicle weight and the speed at 
which it becomes airborn if the shape of the compared vehicles is the same?

On a heavy vehicle like a bus would a dam improve fuel economy any?  Or would 
you be better off "smoothing" the bottom of the bus with flat panels to 
minimize turbulence?
