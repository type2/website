Subject: RE: [T2] Side view mirrors

For those inclined to replace their mirrors, I have three different options
for Busses:

1) OEM German chrome ones, for $29.95 each. You won't find German mirrors
elsewhere for anywhere near this price.  Most sell Brazilian or Taiwanese
copies for almost the same price that rust out quickly and do not have the
same glass quality (there can be ripples in the reflection). I have to
import these myself, but the quality is so much better than the aftermarket
ones that it's worth the effort.

2) Aftermarket Brazilian-made black plastic ones, for $12.95 each. These
look similar to the stock chrome ones but in a matte black finish.  They are
your best choice if you're on a tight budget.  They're not as good quality
as the other mirrors I sell, but unlike the cheap chrome ones sold
elsewhere, as least they won't rust out right away.

3)  OEM Volkswagen/Brazil "Deluxe" black plastic ones, for $29.95 each.
These really sharp looking mirrors came factory-installed on the high-end
"Deluxe" passenger busses sold in Brazil and Mexico. They slightly resemble
Vanagon mirrors but are designed for a bus. They have a larger glass surface
for better visibility, and are much better quality than the aftermarket
plastic ones mentioned above.
