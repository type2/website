Subject: Engine lid removal?

Help! My westy suffered some rear end damage over the weekend.  The rear 
hatch and engine lid (rear cover) took most of the impact and both will need 
to be replaced.  The rear hatch will be an easy replacement, but looking at 
the engine lid, it looks like the hinges and hinge pins are welded in.  Has 
anybody replaced the engine lid on a 72-79 bus?  If so, do I really need to 
cut metal to remove the old one and weld in the replacement?  Is there an 
easier way?
