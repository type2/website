Subject: looking for e-brake cable info 

Hello all I would like to know the length of the part of a bus e-brake from
the end to where the cable comes out
to head under/in the bus
I'm sure different years were differnt but I need a range if there is
also as I can't remeber is the part in the drum the same as a beetle

I need to put e-brakes back in my Baja bug that I just sold (have to get
saftey for new owner) this car is raised a fair bit so longer cables are
needed

once the Baja is out of the way I will be getting serious on my double cab
project it's a 71 but really tough so any good links to stuff is great

thanks
Tim (Skinny)Johnson
