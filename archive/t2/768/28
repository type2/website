Subject: fuel pump troubleshooting on 78 2.0 FI.

The engine is back in the 78 2.0L FI automatic transmission along with a
used transmission I found locally. I've checked over my work a number of
times now, but cannot figure out why I'm not getting electricity to my
fuel pump. It feels like I'm debugging my own code at this point.

I've run through the tests in bentley for the double relay, and it
appears the fuel pump should be pumping with the key in both the run and
start positions. The bus turns over easily using the key/starter.
However, I'm not hearing the whir of the pump without applying electricty 
directly.

Is there something between the relay and the pump I should investigate?

Thanks much in advance,

jack
