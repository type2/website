Don't bother with a "kit".  Just get a new Bosch alternator and scrounge
up a used German alternator stand and 30A (bug) tin for the shroud.  The
German tin and stand are much better than the Chinese parts in the "kits"
You will also need an "alternator style" fuel pump and pushrod.

Excellent idea.  Dual port cylinder tin usually needs a little brazing
here and there to fix cracks.

Yes, but why are you using a light flywheel on a bus?

Get a Liebstritz (spelling?)  They cost more than Mexican or Brazilian
mufflers and are well worth it.  Do yourself a favor and put anti-sieze on
the muffler studs.

The heater boxes might needs some TLC if the housings are loose on the
pipes.  A bit of brazing will make them good as new.
