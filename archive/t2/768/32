Hey Jack,
Unfortunately, I don't have a bentley in front of me so I can't look in 
the wiring diagram, but at least you know that the wiring is good to 
your fuel pump.

Now, as you said in your other email:

and it
appears the fuel pump should be pumping with the key in both the run and
start positions.

This is not true.  The fuel pump should be pumping when the key is in 
the START position (via the double relay), and it will also run when 
when the key is in the ON position, but only if the engine is running 
and the flapper door is moved from its stationary postition.  I don't 
know how well you understand the AFM, but there's a little switch in 
there that turns the fuel pump on.  It's a good safety device because if 
the engine dies, the pump also stops.

So, probably the next thing I'd do is put a test light up to the fuel 
pump wires and crank the engine.  If it lights, then you know your fuel 
pump part of your double relay is working.  You might not be getting 
power to your ECU which would keep the engine from running as well.  Do 
you have all the injector wires hooked up correctly?

One last thing, you mentioned that the pump works if you apply current 
directly to it.  Does the engine run when you do this?  Just curious if 
you have all the other FI components hooked up correctly.
