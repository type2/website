Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Line Questions

It's more than just length I think. There are male-female thread differences also. The left rear hose has a male on one end and a female on the other while the other 3 have female threads at both ends. At least that is the way my 71 is set up. 
I would think if the longer female/female hose is used on the right rear, there might be a possibility of the line kinking and closing off. The correct one fits just right so why put incorrect ones on when the correct ones are available fairly inexpensively.

Hmm... And it appears that my 281...B line is 340mm, and the others
are 270mm and 265mm.

Anybody tried the longer hose on the rears? Isuses with binding and/or
rubbing?
