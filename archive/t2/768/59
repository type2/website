I've done it without a press.  Some of them just slide out by hand!

Some, particularly new ones, don't!  For these I just use a brass hammer.
Any metal will do, as long as it is softer than the steel the CV is made
of.

To remove or install the CV, simply tap on the inner hub while holding the
outer hub out of the way.  work your way round and round with firm taps
and the hub should work its way off of the splines.

When reassembling, omit the dished washer per VW's instructions.

You only need to remove one CV to replace both boots.  You might get lucky
and find one CV to be loose on each axle.  Take off the easy one.

There is a special tool for getting the boot over the splines, but I have
had good luck with simply wrapping the splines with electrical tape.
start wrapping from the axle end of the spline toward the CV end.

Invest in a lot of paper towels and gloves for this job.  Greasy is the
word here!
