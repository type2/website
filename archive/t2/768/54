A lot of people think that their buses are sagging in the rear because:

1. They can't see the horizon through their indoor rearview mirror.

or

2. When the bus is parked, the nose seems to be a bit high compared to the
rear.

Both of these are misleading.  If the ride height is correct you can't see
the horizon through the rear view mirror on a '71.  Other years had
different mirrors, but I know the '71!

Since the driver is sitting over the front wheels, it is expected that the
bus will be a bit high in front with the driver and front passenger
missing.  Put a couple of hundred pounds in the front seat and the front
will drop an inch or two.

I made the mistake of falling for these false signs when I first got my
bus, and ended up ruining a set of CV boots and rear tires by adjusting
the trailing arms too high.
