Nope, it won't.  In modern cars, when you turn the car on the pump will
run for a few seconds to prime the fuel circuit and then turn off.  Then
when you crank, it turns it back on.  If the car detects a tach signal
(meaning the plugs are firing), it keeps the pump flowing.  This is also
how the megasquirt works (which is what I have on my bus).

I'm not familiar with the djet so can't comment there...
