Subject: Re: [T2] '68 Bay for sale in Hawaii

From sailorkh:

I know the door handle and locks are one year only on the '68, but beyond 
 that I'm pretty sure most parts are interchangeable.
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

A few more things are 68 only:

Wiper arms
Wiper arm shafts
Rear view mirror
Body section where rear view mirror mounts
Upper brake reservoir
Lower brake reservoir
Metal pipe between both reservoirs
Front doors

There are others.....
