Subject: Re: [T2] fuel pump troubleshooting on 78 2.0 FI.

The engine was running perfectly prior to dropping it for the 
transmission swap. I disconnected the fuel rail and segments of the 
wiring harness which would prevent the engine from coming out: 
harness->ECU, double relay, double relay ground, voltage regulator, and 
the alternator->starter solendoid (if I recall correctly). I'll
determine whether it starts while running the fuel pump directly or not,
as well as whether electricity is getting to the pump during cranking.

I guess I'm not understanding the flow of electicity during starting to
the fuel pump. I'll hit the bentley again and see if I can figure out
what is supposed to be happening. I would have sworn the fuel pump
kicked on with the key in position 2, Run, prior to replacing the
transmission; but, it is entirely possible I'm confusing the Volvo's 
behavior with the bus -- my Volvo is D-Jet.
