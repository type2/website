Subject: 71 wipers

Hi Everybody,

	I'm in need of some info about the wipers on our '71.  I just
installed new Bosch 16 inch wiper blades that I ordered form Bus Depot.
They went on with no problem and then I decided to check the wiper arms to
see if they are installed as per the Bentley manual.  I checked the
measurement given for the drivers side arm and found it to be pretty close
to the 80 mm measurement given in the manual.  The passenger side was also
set near 80 mm and so I decided to set it to the proper 100 mm the manual
gives.  With it installed that way the passenger side blade is at quite an
angle with the outboard end pointing up.  I didn't measure the angle but I'm
going to guess that it was in the neighborhood of 20 to 30 degrees past
having the blade horizontal, very noticeable.  Since the arm doesn't seem to
be bent, broken or distorted I'm wondering if it's the wrong arm.  It sure
seems to be the same as the driver side wiper arm, I removed it and held it
in front of the drivers side arm to compare them.
	Can anyone tell me if on a '71 both wiper arms are the same part
number or are they different?
