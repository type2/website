Subject: Re: [T2] Engine lid removal?

If you are going to need to cut metal anyway then you might as well put a 
Vanagon lid in there, they are twice as big!

Help! My westy suffered some rear end damage over the weekend.  The rear 
hatch and engine lid (rear cover) took most of the impact and both will 
need 
to be replaced.  The rear hatch will be an easy replacement, but looking 
at 
the engine lid, it looks like the hinges and hinge pins are welded in. Has 

anybody replaced the engine lid on a 72-79 bus?  If so, do I really need 
to 
cut metal to remove the old one and weld in the replacement?  Is there an 
easier way?
