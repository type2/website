Our mirrors run long side vertical. I have several sets with no
plastic molding at all. I can't imagine why Peter's fell out. I would
be inclined to just remove it to make the mirror look better. Then you
can see if the mirror is loose inside, and if so use some type of
adhesive or caulk to secure it to the frame.
