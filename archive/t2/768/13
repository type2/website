I'm not trying to say that the pump is worth anything. I'm trying to
troubleshoot an issue that's NOT caused by the pump.

Remember, my bus was doing the same thing with the mechanical pump.
Facet was still at Napa. The pump just helped me isolate the issue.
For that reason, if no other, it was worth every penny of the $40.
