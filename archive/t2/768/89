#11 is the plastic fan. It WON'T blow a fuse!
#2 is the motor and fan assembly. It can blow a fuse.

Before you use the Mossberg repair style [replacing
parts before testing by shotgunning.....] unplug the 2
wire connector on the back of the motor and put a new
fuse in. Turn on the fan, see if it blows. If yes, it
is not the motor. If no, plug in the motor. Does it
blow the fuse? If yes, replace the motor.

 I purchased a 78 bus not long ago and when testing
 the heating system out
 I blow the 16amp fuse when I turn on the heat.  Is
 this a bad blower fan
 / wheel causing this most likely?  Is the part in
 question #11 in this
 image?  Is replacing this the first step in
 troubleshooting the problem?
