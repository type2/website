Subject: Rear lights 1972 Westy

Hello.  I am getting some calls on my 1972 Westy, but I haven't  completed 
getting it ready for the road.

You may remember my brakes situatuion (I had to swap the front calipers and 
bleed the brakes with the bleeding screw on top - works great now!!) and the 
clutch pedal came up too high before it engages the clutch (Bentley says 
there should be 1/32" to 3/32" distance between the adjusting wing nut and 
the clutch arm; mine was as tight as a piano's G-string.  I loosened the nut 
some 6 half turns and I am happier.  Still contributing to the clutch pedal 
long rise is a worn clutch disk.)

The rear lights don't work.  I checked fuses in the fuse panel and the fuse 
in the engine compartment.  I expect it may be a ground wire that was not 
yet attached.

Any other ideas??  I did not check the bulbs, but both sides tail/stop 
lights, backup lights, and rear side marker are out, but the amber turn 
signals work great, front AND rear, as does the license plate light and the 
headlights

Thanks
