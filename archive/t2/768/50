Unless you are a glutton for punishment get the
progressive Carb. I have had nothing but problems out
of the dual carbs, unless you have above average
skills with syncing carbs and linkage adjustments stay
away from the dual carbs.. With the progressive it is
easy to adjust, just the idle RPM and mixture. Phil
