Subject: NOS overriders for sale

I have a complete set of NOS never installed bumper over riders. This is a pair for the front bumper and a pair for the rear. They include the plastic seals that go between the overrider and bumper and all the correct hardware. They are a powdery white color,still in original box. Will need to be painted. They are made for the bumpers without the rubber impact strip.
I would like a $100.00 for the complete set plus shipping. Paypal ok.
Located in Mystic,CT.
