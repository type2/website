Subject: Re: [T2] '68 Bay for sale in Hawaii

I am going to a local junk yard after church services this morning to pull a 
part off a 1968 bus.

I see the notes about 1968 only parts, and I will try to take the upper 
brake reservoir, if it is OK.  The VW is pretty well blocked and I doubt I 
can get at the lower brake reservoir, but if I can, what is the easiest way 
to get it off.  Is it mostly a jerk and pull operation.  If yes, I know a 
jerk I can ask to come along  ;-)

I am also going after the fuses because this morning I dropped a fuse from 
the 1972 down the front kick panel, and if there are any of these antique 8 
amp fuses on the 1968, I will grab them.

The rear view mirror is there, as well as the front door handles, but this 
yard ALWAYS charges too much for their items.  Particularly J. R.

I don't think the wiper arms are there; the windshield is crushed and the 
VIN was removed before I got there!!!

Hey, what is it with this 'tire under the front seat'?

A few more things are 68 only:

Wiper arms
Wiper arm shafts
Rear view mirror
Body section where rear view mirror mounts
Upper brake reservoir
Lower brake reservoir
Metal pipe between both reservoirs
Front doors


There are others.....
