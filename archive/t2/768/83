Subject: heater blower fan

I purchased a 78 bus not long ago and when testing the heating system out
I blow the 16amp fuse when I turn on the heat.  Is this a bad blower fan
/ wheel causing this most likely?  Is the part in question #11 in this
image?  Is replacing this the first step in troubleshooting the problem?
