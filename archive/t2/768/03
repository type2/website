I was just going to suggest the same thing. Most of the items on the shelf
are junk but there is an occasional gem.

Like anything else, there is no limit to what you can spend but in the
$30-$40 price range are these units which work great:

BMW# 82 12 0 140 377

These units are reasonably priced and let you bleed the excess from the tire
until they read correctly. The BMW version is more motorcycle friendly (90
degree fitting).
