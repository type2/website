Subject: RE: [T2] Anyone have a cutting torch around DC?

Sawz all is the way to go if you don't have a plasma cutter. A torch can do
the job, but is not going to be as nice as a blade. I cut a bug up when making
a trick once and it cut like butter. Just have a lot of blades handy. I have a
plasma cutter now, but even that has its down side if their is anything that
can catch fire.
