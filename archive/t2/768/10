Subject: Anyone know anything about Day Campers?

http://seattle.craigslist.org/car/84772834.html
 Hey hey, can ya'll take a look at this link and tell me what you know of
this sort of camper? And any potential trouble I should be looking for? It's
cheap enough to easily fit in my budget, with a little left over for fix it
upper stuff. I think I can get access to pretty much a full woodshop (I'm
MUCH better with wood than with metal) so repair of cabnets isn't a major
concern. I'm thinking to get this bus for my camping, and keep my current
bus and maybe take baby steps (yeah, "what about bob" is on TV) towards
fixing it up. Put POR15 on the rust for now until I can wrap my head around
all that welding.
 Anyway, I'm gonna go take a look at it when I get off work in the morning
at 7:00 am pacific time, so if anyone could reply before then, that would be
GGRrrreat!
 The above link has pictures for you to look at and say "So THAT'S what he's
talking about!!" Just please nobody rush out and buy it before me. Lol
 From the pcitures it looks more like my level of restoration would be
involved.
 Thanks in advance
Chris
