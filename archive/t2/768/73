Subject: Anyone have a cutting torch around DC?

So far I have always used a grinder with cutting discs to cut out panels
before sending a car to the crusher. But I guess an acetylene/oxygen
torch is the way to go. However, I'd like to try this out before
shelling out $$$ to buy a nice torch. Does anyone around DC have one I
could borrow for a day or so?

Thanks,
Marcus
