Subject: Re: [T2] Bulkhead removal and different front seats

Tim,

Thanks for the info.....I'm getting a clearer picture re the seats. I
think with a bit of metal any seat will fit if the rails can be
removed from the donor car....I have seen some Jaguar seats today,
lower ride height and very comfortable fitted to a Type 2. There are
many Jags in breakers yards in the UK ! Not too many Camrys over
here.....

The bulk head is the remaining problem. Have you had any experience
with that or know anyone else? I don't want to reduce the integrity of
the bus ......?!?

Charles
