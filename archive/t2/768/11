Subject: clutch replacement on 73 westy

Just had 1.7 liter rebuilt by Boston Bob' s Long block (he did a nice job) .
Question is , the clutch that was with the engine before it was rebuilt looks
preety darn good  (total thickness is .350". Is it a rule of thumb to replace
clutch when history of existing clutch is not known. Thanks
