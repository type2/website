Alex: Mine was a different symptom, but the solution was the same as 
yours. The whole episode ended up being gratifying for the simple 
reason that it was one of the few times when understanding of the way 
a circuit worked led directly to the solution.

For months, my high beams would toggle on without warning.  I stared 
at the wiring diagram and then read a post that described the 
function of the hi/low beam relay; namely, that it is toggled between 
the two states by grounding one of the terminals.

I began removing the steering column cowl etc and, sure enough, a 
brown wire had been routed close to the sharp edge of a piece of 
metal and the insulation had been worn away. Whenever the bus would 
hit a bump or a sharp turn, the wire would be grounded to the frame 
and the relay would be toggled.

This sort of direct path to a solution happens so infrequently in my 
driveway that I had to share.

Jack
