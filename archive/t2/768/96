Subject: Westy pop-top ceiling fuzz?

Hi all -

I have removed and am currently repainting the
fibergalss pop-top from my '78 westy, ready for a new
tent that is on its way.  The question I have is
regarding the fuzzy "flocking" that is on the
underside of the top (i.e. the ceiling above the top
bunk). This has gone moldy, dry and powdery in places,
so I want to remove it all and just paint the inside
of the top (I assume I'll lose a modicum of
insulation, but my wife objects to breathing mold
spores and microfibers, for some strange reason ;-) 

On the front half of the top, I managed to sand it all
off; on the rear half, however, it is in better
condition, and cannot be sanded off easily, because it
is still flexible. So I have 3 questions:

1) has anyone found a good way to remove this stuff?

2) has anyone had any success just painting over the
flocking, and if so, what type of paint/prep?

3) has anyone tried any more-novel upgrades (such as
wood panelling, upholstered cloth over new insulation,
etc)?

Thanks in advance -

Matthew
