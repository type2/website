They will fit, but the initial setting is a matter of guesswork.  You want
the ride height to be the same as the stock bus for handling concerns.

If you adjust the camper bars per the camper specs in a deluxe bus it
will ride too high, since the camper is heavier.

If you adjust the camper bars per the deluxe specs, the ride height will
still be too high , since the deluxe bars will twist more from the
unloaded position when load is applied.

You therefore want to start with a trailing arm setting a bit less (in
terms of angle) than the Bentley specs.  Unfortunately, this still will
probably involve trial and error.
