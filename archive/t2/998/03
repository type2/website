-Complete overhead A/C unit from a 79 bus. (Sorry, you gotta pick it up.)

-Big Box 'o' Carbs - 3-4 complete sets of PDSITs with intakes. Many
good solenoids and choke elements and such. They're all in pieces
though. All the throttle bodies need bushings. Again, too big to ship.
Pick it up here.

-Black vinyl bulkhead panels - From a 71. I may even have the bulkhead
caps around somewhere. Actual shipping from Denver.

-I have more stuff but can't think of it ATM.

If anything's left by next weekend it goes in the dipsy dumpster.
(Except maybe for the magic pulley for the A/C. I might eBay that...)
