			BBQ   RULES

We are about to enter the BBQ season.  Therefore it is important to 
refresh your memory on the etiquette of this sublime outdoor cooking 
activity

When a man volunteers to do the BBQ the following chain of events are 
put into motion:

(starting with supportive routine...)
(1) The woman buys the food.
(2) The woman makes the salad, prepares the vegetables, and makes the desserts.
(3) The woman prepares the meat for cooking, places it on a tray 
along with the necessary cooking utensils and sauces,   and takes it 
to the man who is lounging beside the grill - beer in hand.
(4) The woman remains outside the compulsory three meter exclusion 
zone where the exuberance of testosterone and other manly bonding 
activities can take place without the interference of the woman.

Here comes the important part:
(5) THE MAN PLACES THE MEAT ON THE GRILL.

(More routine... )
(6) The woman goes inside to organize the plates and cutlery.
(7) The woman comes out to tell the man that the meat is looking 
great. He thanks her and asks if she will bring another beer  while 
he flips the meat .

Important again:
(8) THE MAN TAKES THE MEAT OFF THE GRILL AND HANDS IT TO THE WOMAN.

(More routine...)
(9) The woman prepares the plates, salad, bread, utensils, napkins, 
sauces, and brings them to the table.
(10) After eating, the woman clears the table and does the dishes.

And most important of all:
(11) Everyone PRAISES the MAN and THANKS HIM for his cooking efforts.
(12) The man asks the woman how she enjoyed "her night off."  And, 
upon seeing her annoyed reaction, concludes that there's just no 
pleasing some women...
