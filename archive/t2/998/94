Subject: Re: [T2] Fw: props to Bus depot

I'm not part of Bus Depot but, I do own a shop and am thankful when folks 
take the same time used to complain to make compliments. Too often you hear 
complaints and not compliments. Just because you didn't complain doesn't mean it's 
a compliment. I'm sure Bus Depot is grateful for your compliment. So to others 
out there feel free to compliment your repair shops and part suppliers who 
ever they might be when they deserve it. It does make a difference to the people 
who bust there butts for you.
