Subject: Trailer Hitch Info

Do any of you have any information on getting a trailer hitch on a 1973 bus?
Is there anything special to take into consideration or, can I have anyone
install one locally? I am looking to get a little mount for my Vespas but,
it needs a trailer hitch to plug into.

Any info would be much appreciated!

Thanks in advance.
