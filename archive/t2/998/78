Subject: Re: [T2] Problems with 78 after new points

Remember, new points don't necessarily mean good points.  (Good point??)  Might drop the old ones in for a check. The air leak test is probably where you'll find the problem, though.   Good luck...KR

The timing light went bad on me so that is why I have not been able to check
it.  I did  confirm the points opening at 45-48 degrees with the dwell
meter.  I will recheck them today and am in the process of borrowing a
timing light to check and adjust that.  The spark plug order from
distributor cap was one of the first things I checked and double checked
they were correct.  ( I too hooked them up wrong before) The AFM is pluged
in also.  I am going to retrace my steps today.  I am going to recheck and
adjust the points today.  Check and adjust timing as soon as I borrow a
timing light. Triple check for a vacume leak and ..........? ?
Thanks
