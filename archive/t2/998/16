Wow, I don't know a whole lot but that sounds like a great price to me.
Espescially if you can fix that engine yourself. What condition is the
convertable top in? I would guess those can be pricey. Eiter way, even if it
needs a moderate amount of work I would think that is a good price.

Good luck.
