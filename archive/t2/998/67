Hey bussers, if you're running Firefox as your browser (free download), you
should definitely check out this website for searching for that hard to find
bus part.  www.craigshelper.com

I discovered it just yesterday and it helps you search for that much needed
part or whatever across multiple cities/states all at once.

If anyone is using something similar that might be better for getting around
craigslist, let me know!

Thanks!

Brad
