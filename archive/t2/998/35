Subject: Re: [T2] cly. head gaskets

Mike asked:


 In the next couple of weeks I am planning to drop my engine and cure some oil leaks. Bentleys says no
cylinder head gaskets are used but Bus Depot and others have them listed for sale. If I remove my heads do i
need cylinder head gaskets on hand or no?

VW says to not use them, but you need to shim the barrels on the bottom to make up the difference.  Read about
it here:
