Hiya  Mark,

In several postings here at Type 2 you have mentioned that you  have drilled 
holes in the hub of early baywindow steering wheels for easier  removal.? 
Makes a lot of sense to me.? I?really don't want to have to take a  chance on 
wrecking the plastic when I pull the wheel, especially after  restoring the wheel.

But I do have a question for you............how do  you account for the turn 
signal canceling ring?? It looks to me like I'm going  to have to drill though 
that also.? And it also looks like drilling through it  will turn it into a 
piece of swiss cheese.? That's pretty much what happened  when I drilled the 
wheel already in place in the bus in order to remove it  (and that removal went 
very well - thanks!).

Is there something I'm  overlooking here?? Any details you may be able to 
provide will certainly be  appreciated.

Hello Mike   Other than using the correct steering wheel puller,  Which I got 
a chance to see at buses on the River, the other choices are to make  your 
own or drill holes and tap them. The correct tool looks a lot like a tie  rod 
remover, difference is that the bolt part has a tapered end that pushes on  the 
steering shaft . It pays to keep the nut loosened but still in place to keep  
the sharft from spreading out. I have seen some homemade ones also. these push 
 from the bottom of the wheel.  Drilling two  holes and tapping for 6mm  
bolts  and then using a crows foot puller works very well. I never drill  all the 
way thur so that I never get near the signal canceller  later   mark d
