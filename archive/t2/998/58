The bus ball is freakin' awesome, beats a lot of progressive art out there 
these days . . .not to mention the bus pool table (better that then rusting 
away in a field)!!!  If a few more busses get hacked in the process . . .at 
least their getting positive attention and notice . . .just like say, the 
Little Miss Sunshine bus.  It's not like the VW Bus is as important as say 
polar bears or sea turtles going extinct.  Maybe my westy will be worth 190 
grand when I croak . . .at least my benny's will appreciate the $$$ if not 
the bus itself.
