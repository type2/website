9 times out of 10 this scenario is solved by adding
gas to an empty gas tank and nobody ever talks about
it again! Do you hear the gas flowing through the
lines when you run the pump? Other than that, possibly
ignition points were on last leg and finally gave up?
If it starts with start fkuid, that discounts that
theory. I'll stick with "out of gas." What do I win?

 HELP!  My '78 Westy was running fine on Saturday,
 just idling like it
 should.  I turned off the engine and went about
 doing some odd-n-end
 activities around the garage, then about an hour
 later I tried to start
 her - to no avail.  It will start using "starting
 fluid", but then dies
 suddenly and will not re-start (except with a shot
 of starting fluid -
 then dies immediately).  I removed the fuel pump -
 thinking that it was
 not working - and it tests good, so I put it back
 on, and the same
 condition applies (only runs momentarily with
 starting fluid).  A buddy
 stopped by and he thinks that my injectors are no
 longer firing ....
 What could have changed???  It was running fine
 before I shut it down,
 and NOTHING was touched after that.  I have an extra
 AFM lying around
 (not entirely positive that it is good, but no
 reason to believe that it
 is "bad"), and I put it in place of the old AFM
 ..... with NO CHANGE!
 What could I be missing?
