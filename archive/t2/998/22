Charlie,

With a voice like yours I always thought you ought to be a minister or a politician. In your quarters there is only a shade of difference between them anyway.

During election season you would have to be sure and wear shoes with laces all the time and eat with utensils. The Georgians I have know are a proud people and they expect some decorum. That is my advice.

Ken
