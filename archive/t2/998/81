Did you notice, every single car expected to exceed 200K is Japanese?  But to drive one for 15 years?  It would be worth the $20,500 not to.  After all, that's only $1,367/year.  Tad over $113/mo.  You get what you don't pay for. :)  Put that money (and what it'll cost you to buy it) in your bus and you'll have a show winner before it's over.  And you'll be a happy camper, pardon the campy pun.    TGIF....KR
