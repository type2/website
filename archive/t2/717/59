 Dear John,

It may be a transatlantic misunderstanding, but you read rather 
sarcastic in that sentence. I had realised our two nations were 
different. Actually, my understanding was that the US and UK were 51 
different countries, with 51 sets of laws. We have a strange rule that 
people have to pay for a licence just to own a TV! You chaps once made 
alcohol illegal.  . 

I only asked the question because I really wanted to know why it was 
illegal to import a Brazilian bus into the US until it is 25 years old. 
It cannot be safety or emissions, otherwise why let in 25 year old 
buses? I was also wondering if the law (if it exists at all, as you 
correctly point out) just applies to Brazil.
