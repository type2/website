Hi Jamie,

Thanks for the information. I'm a notorious space case, so I'm sure it
is a 6 rib I have, not a 5. The changes in the shift stick and new
dimple in the hockey stick seem the most relevant, but the other
information is very valuable too. Which piece is called "hockey
stick"?

Thanks,

John

 I am not sure if this applies to the 5 Rib trans plus you have a 72 body,,, so
 the differences make it difficult for me to answer..  but if this helps,, read

 With the help of David  Schwarze and Marcus Schafer and Jamie Auch...
 I put a 091 <6 rib> in my '74 body what was originally a 002 trans, dual carb
 engine
 at the same time,, I installed a 2 liter with Efi
 
 Here is the list of changes I made in regards to the transmission
 Swap bellhousing from 002 to the 091 to maintain the SR15 or SR17 starter[1]
 Swap the 228 mm flywheel to the 210 mm flywheel clutch and pressure plate[2]
 install the 1978 upper trans holder for the throttle cable tube location
 install the 1978 straight shift stick
 drill a new dimple in the hockey stick about 12mm closer to the nosecone
