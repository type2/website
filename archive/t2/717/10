Let me clarify.

If you buy a rebuild distributor and A-1 Cardone made it, there is a 95%
chance the distributor specs will differ from what you ordered. A-1 Cardone
just cranks out distributors, they do NOT rebuild them. They are
disassembled and blasted, and reassembled. The part #s for the unit you get
will not be a factory match 80% of the time. And when it does match, 50% of
the time the guts have been swapped so it isn't what the #s on the outside
said it was anyways. This also means that on a rare occasion you'll get a
distributor with the wrong #s but the right performance (specs), but this is
very very rare.

I'm simply saying that those distributors in that link are garbage, and
should not be considered by anyone that is actually going to drive the car.

If I was not clear before I sincerely apologize. I hope this helps. But
specs in a bentley manual, shop manual, or anywhere else will NOT correspond
to a Cardone distributor, so they are of little use.
