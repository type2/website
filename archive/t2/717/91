This came up on another list I'm on, with the person at-
tempting to end run the law by re-importing the same
car from Mexico, and a year later, from Canada...
Diplomats, however, can keep their vehicles for the
length of their stay in the US..."Some" grey market
cars come from this source, but (IIRC) some of the
embassies crush the vehicles rather than pay the
cost of freighting them home... ;-(
FWIW, a few years ago a buddy of mine bought a
very low mileage Alfa Romeo Spider for a very low
price...The problem arose when he went to register
it...It came with a Canadian title, but the NJ state
DMV refused to transfer the title to him and handed
him a print out of Federal agencies that he could
contact to legalize the car...He ended up selling the
car for even less that he paid to an Alfa mechanic
who planned to transfer VINS from a legal wreck...
NOT A GOOD IDEA...The penalties for THAT are
big buck fines, and even a little time in the Bob
Wire Motel... ;-(
