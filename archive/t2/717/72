Subject: Clutch

I had a slight problem getting the stick into third on the way home tonight.
I could get it into 1st, 2nd & 4th, but not third.

Upon getting home I checked the free play on the clutch pedal and it was
something like 1" or a bit more so I gave the wing nut on the clutch cable a
few turns to tighten it up.

I haven't taken the bus back out yet, but it now goes into third okay
sitting in the drive.  Have I done the right thing?  (Just want to be sure
before I take it back out on the road to check.)
