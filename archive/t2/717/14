Subject: RE: [T2] how to remove a fridge?

Thanks Joel,
The fridge is only AC/DC not propane, however there is the hose that goes
to the stove. I know the tank is empty since it vented ;) last year.
I may have the valve redone in the tank and use it for propne for a heater
or a bbq, etc.  Just install an on/off and a 3 way or something.

remove the passenger seat & you will see some bolts that secure the fridge
unit in place. i think there is also a bracket that holds it to the floor.
be careful when you unhook the propane sections.
