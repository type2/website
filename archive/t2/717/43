the hockey stick is one of the only pieces you can see from outside
the transaxle. Or at least part of it. The actual connection point for
the shifter rod, is the end of the stick. Unless you pull off the nose
cone it seems daffy that a round rod is called a hockey stick. However
get it out and it makes a bend to become flat. Kinda looking like a
hockey stick, but with the blade parallel to the ice surface instead
of perpendicular. This thing has to be the correct size and
configuration otherwise it will not operate the shifter levers in the
transaxle.
