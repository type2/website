yes and no.

yes they work
no they are not fast, each nibble is about 1/4 inch.
they take a LOT of energy and strength to use on metal the thickness of a
VW bus.
get a good one, I have broken em more than once

it might be cheaper to get a good battery sawzall. a good nibbler is not
cheap

good luck, last time I had to cut one up I got a gazillion extension cords
to run power out to my "real" sawzall it takes some real power to cut up
major body panels.
