It's illegal to import ANY car that doesn't meet Federal standards
into the USA...So-called "grey market" cars are the responsibility
of the importer (you) to bring them up to spec...Once upon a
time this might have been possible (Bill Fink, in San Francisco,
brought Morgans into the USA in the earl 70's but with exten-
sive mods and propane fueling...) but with today's extreme safe-
ty and emissions standards, it would be virtually impossible with-
out spending many times what the vehicle cost or is worth...
I seem to recall that even Bill Gates spent a fortune legalizing
a couple of 959 Porsches...;-(

                   one's station" ... ?-)
