Subject: first time valve job and fridge removed

The fridge removal went slick and easy.
I also decided to remove the water tank at the same
time and create some storage space. We usually use a portable
water tank anyway. That was trickier than the fridge/stove.

Anyway.. I know I have had a bus (s) for a while now but
this morning was the first time I did a valve adjustment on my
own. I had watched one before and followed muir's guide.
I'm so impressed! <ok , stop laughing at me :) >

Spring is in the air.
