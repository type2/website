Not exactly true. If the vehicle is 22 years old or older (based on year of
manufacture or original registration) it is exempt from all U.S. EPA import
regulations (emissions). However, until it is 25 years old it is must still
meet U.S. DOT import regulations (crash test and safety standards),
effectively rendering the EPA exemption moot.  Once it hits 25 years old
there is no need to prove that it meets any DOT or EPA regulations
whatsoever in order to import it.  You can simply claim exemption due to
age. This exemption applies to the importation of vehicles from any country.
