Subject: Re: [T2] windshield install question

I always saturate the seal and window frame with armor all to get it
good and slippery. You might spray around it to get it slippery and
then it might loosen up enough to self correct by driving around like
you suggest. Hate to see you have to take it out again!

 i installed a windshield just now and the issue is i didn't want to force
 something. the inner lip of the seal on the upper passenger side is about
 1/4 from completely sat.i can see the old mark on the headliner left by the
 previous seal - just on the right side from the rearview mirror about two
 feet. should i slap it in with pressure or drive around and wait for it to
 seat some on the sill, and then wap it? like a nit-wit i didn't use silicone
 spray or any lubricant. - steve
