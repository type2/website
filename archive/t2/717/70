I know of one way to get a new Type II in the USA.  A
friend of mine has several VWs including a nice Type
II.  In his driveway I saw a new-looking bug.  He told
me that it was a 1997 Mexican bug that he bought from
a guy in Dalton, Georgia.  Mexican immigrants are
allowed to bring one vehicle into the country with
them that is exempt from the safety and emmissions
standards.  We have a new emissions policy in my
county where you cannot register a vehicle that has
not passed an emissions test.  My 1976 bus is exempt
because it has a 1974 engine in it and vehicles made
prior to 1975 are exempt.  I got a letter from my VW
dealership.  Anyhow, I don't know how he will be
affected by that, but you can get one in if you know
someone who is going to immigrate and can negotiate a
deal to buy his personal vehicle once he's here. 
Actually, it would be a good deal for the immigrant as
he could make some money to start out with.  

I was in Mexico a few years ago and saw a dealership
with a lot full of brand new busses and bugs.  It was 
like going back in time!  Don't know if they still
make busses in Mexico, but they probably at least
import them from Brazil.  I don't know about prices. 
But you might could find a deal on a used one much
newer than ours.  They look great.  Thanks...KR
