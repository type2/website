Subject: 80 Vanagon rear brakes?

My brake pedal is a little low. I previously bled all brakes with no
improvement to pedal height but it did get rid of the spongy feeling. Looked
at the lining on rear shoes through the inspection hole. seems to be plenty of
lining. This morning I thought I'd adjust the shoes but cant seem to get the
adjusters to turn. Don't know if it's the tool I'm using or the adjusters are
frozen. Any tricks I should Know?

Checked Bentley. Says after brake work to press the pedal several times so
brakes self adjust before driving. I don't think this is working! I press the
pedal then release. As I let pedal up slowly I think I can hear the adjuster
lever click over one of the bumps on the adjustment wheel but get no
improvement.

I think I'll need to pull the drums and check the adjusters but if I cant get
the adjusters to turn I don't know if I can get the shoes loose enough to
remove the drums Any sugestions?

Do I realy need to pull the hub like bentley shows or does the drum come off
the hub? Looks like if I remove two bolts the drum should come off the hub?

When adjusting the shoes through the hole in the backing plate, what direction
do I move the wheel to tighten the shoes?

On non-german vehicles I've worked on, the self adjusters did most of the
adjusting when the car had breaks aplied while moving in the reverse
direction. Is this also true of Vanagons?
