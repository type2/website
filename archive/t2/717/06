Subject: how to remove a fridge?

I am going to take out the fridge/stove from my 74' westie.
I need an extra seat so that is where it will go. Besides the fridge is
really inneficient and we usually cook outdoors.

I had a look on type2.com but nothing came up
Anyone have a removal guide or some first hand knowledge?
(btw I am keeping the fridge etc to reinstall at a future date)

Thanks

James
