Subject: Re: [T2] No power sheet metal cutting

When I was hardcore into case modding I did a lot of work with a hand
nibbler. I still have callouses from the (-at-)#%^ thing.

I finally broke down and invested in a Dremel. Never looked back. 

Computer case sheet metal is MUCH softer and thinner than VW Bus sheet metal.
