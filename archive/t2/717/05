Subject: Re: [T2] DVDA for $68?

you don't have to be a dickhead Karl. I'm just saying those distributors are
garbage, and they aren't worth $15 let alone $68. Oh yeah, they have a core
charge too. ;-) Those distributors are JUNK, and should not be seriously
considered by anyone unless broken down in BFE, but in that case the lowly
009 will get you home.

that's a 72-72 unit, timed to 5ATDC at idle both hoses connected. I'm not at
work so the #s aren't handy (I do not have a manual here).

I do not know if this was an April Fools Prank which I fell for, or a
legitimate question. But it's now April 2 and you are being a wanker. I'm
trying to help, that's all.
