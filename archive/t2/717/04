The specs are in the Bentley manual.

Well duh! Is it still April 1st?

Sure, the specs ARE in the Bentley for YOUR old distributor.

But you sure don't have a clue of where to look in the Bentley for that Cardone distributor if they don't give
you an application or a part number that they are using.

Was my remark too hard to understand or do you belong to the rebuilders universal code that 'If it resembles
what you want, it is correct'?

Here is what I wrote:
"What I find interesting is the line:  "All replacement parts meet or exceed OEM specifications."
but when you click on the link Buyers Guide, you get:

Cardone 31916
There currently are not any product applications defined for this product.

???   I sure would love to know the specs on that vacuum unit!"

Now you see if you can find me the exact specs for that 31916 in the Bentley......
