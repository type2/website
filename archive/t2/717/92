BTW, Don, I had trouble sending private email re LED use- please p-mail 
if you did/did not get it....
Re the topic, you can use a dremyl with an imverter on a car battery.  I 
have also cut metal with an air tool cutter that you hit with a small 
sledge.  Punch a hole, then follow with the cutter undercut into the hole.

I use dremyl disks all the time in my music instrument support making- I 
second Don's technique of stabbing in along the line of cut.  Trying to 
follow a line continuously is possible, but only if you have a steady 
hand that does NOT let the disk cut deep, where the slightest twist can 
break it.  I use the fiber disks exclusively unless I need a thin cut, 
and even reinforce the fiber disks with tiny brass washers one each side 
of the disk.  The fiber diskes can be used for fine grinding also, 
skimming it along the surface, as in smoothing a weld.

  I do, though I prefer the reinforced ones whenever possible. There's a
trick to using the little ones. Instead of following the cut line you
  have to lift it out of the cut and press it in right next to the one
  you just did... Kind of like cutting heavy cardboard with just a
  pocket knife. You have to keep stabbing the cardboard to make the cut.
