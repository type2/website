Good info Ron and everyone...

Here's a question: How do we get some of those Brazillian parts here? 

That fiberglass top for one.
Black plastic fresh air grill.
Watercooled radiator grill and maybe even the entire cooling system
from the engine compartment forward.
Those funky door skins with the bulges at the bottom.
Etc...

I'd grab one of the fresh air grills in a heartbeat. And since I'm
still working out how I want to do a swappable top for my high top one
of those fiberglass tops would be pretty sweet.
