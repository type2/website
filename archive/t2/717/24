Subject: RE: [T2] 80 Vanagon rear brakes?

I've never had any luck with the self adjusters.
I've been amazed how adjusting the brakes really helps get the pedal up.
You are on the right track to remove the drums to clean and lubricate the
adjusters...you don't need to remove the hubs.  There should be two eight or
ten mm bolts on the front of the drum.
As far as the direction is concerned, I always forget.  One approach is to
turn it till it's tight, then go in the opposite direction. It helps to look
at the pictures in the Bentley and use your imagination, but that is not
easy for me to do.  I usually just end up taking off the drums and checking
everything out. Nice lubricated adjusters are still not easy to get to, but
trying to work stuck ones can be a real pain in the rear.

It can be a bear, Or it can be easy as pie...to get the drums off.

Not much help, probably, but just my nickle's worth.
