.. and on that note, if anyone wants a Type3 hatch for this project idea, I've got
a few of 'em kicking around.  Should even be able to come up with one or two 
donor metal "lip" sections from the T3 body that the hatch sits on.  I "work"
at a Type3 specialty outfit, and we (unfortunately) have to scrap out cars that
are too far gone to resurrect..
