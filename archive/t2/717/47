 We import a fair few of them over here in the UK - the importer is 
about 10 miles from home. They are a good price compared to a 'modern' 
people carrier, and I like the idea of a fuel injected engine/3 years 
warranty/ separate heater etc etc, but compared to my '73 I always think 
the quality is a bit "plastic" looking - the steel is a lot thinner for 
example. Having said all that, with #15000 in my hand, I would rather 
buy a new bus than spend #20000 on a Ford Mondeo. But with #15000 in my 
hand, I would really rather buy a sound  '71 bus and treat it to a new 
engine, interior and accessories. And then buy a beetle and a split 
screen to renovate. And then a complete set of workshop tools. And then 
put the #3000 change in the bank.
