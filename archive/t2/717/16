 Sorry, folks. I didn't mean to start any arguments. I was just
thumbing through websites for some local flaps to see if I could find
the o-ring for my 205s when I stumbled on that. I'm quite happy with
my 205s (or will be once I get the thing back together. heh)

The special o-ring is available separately from your local Mercedes dealer parts dept.

No problem on the 'argument'.  I failed to follow my fathers advice. He said 'Never argue
with an idiot. They will bring you down to their level and then beat you with experience".
I should have left it alone when his 1st reply was a bunch of name calling that showed his true color.
