Subject: Re: [T2] Engine compartment sound proofing

My Bus has 5 passenger seats and a bed platform in back.  I keep a heavy
double-size futon on the platform (maybe 10-12" thick, completely covering the
area from the back of the "middle" seat to the rear gate).  It reduces engine
noise by around 40-50%.  With the futon, it's easy to have a conversation at
normal volume, whereas without it, conversation is very difficult.

So, it *is* possible to take a less meticulous approach and end up with good
results.

Cheers!
