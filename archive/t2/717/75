Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch

I just did the exact same thing. The symptoms were difficulty getting
into 1st and 2nd, and drag on the bus when idling with the clutch
pedal floored and the stick in 1st.

I recently replaced my clutch cable so it obviously stretched. In fact
it took longer than I expected for the stretch... heh

4 half-turns on that wingnut and everything back to sweetness. =)
