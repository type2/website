Yeah, actually.. there is a company based out of South Carolina I believe
that makes fiberglass VW bay buses. They are about the size of a golf card
(same wheelbase too...). You can move them around, and whatnot, and there's
even a cabin.

There are two of them in the local mall here (Sawgrass Mills Mall in Fort
Lauderdale, Florida).

The middle of the Buses are hollow and they typically put like a vending
machine (usually the toy crane machine) two to each side.

I don't remember the company that makes them... but they're a couple grand.

Anyone know of any plastic toy VW Buses.  I have a marine aquarium and would
like to throw one in.
