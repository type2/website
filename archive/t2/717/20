Anyone have a removal guide or some first hand knowledge?
(btw I am keeping the fridge etc to reinstall at a future date)

Bentley - Chapter 1, Verse 7.

There's a few pages describing the early bay campmobile
equipment in the front of the green Bentley shop manual.

I've had my '73 icebox/sink furniture in and out many
times.  (If you have a '74 walkthrough it's similar.)
10mm bolts on the bulkhead behind the passenger seat
back and two screws into the floor in the aisle hold it
down.
For me the tricky part was making sure the water tank
drain tube didn't get hung up on the hole in the floor.
When I stored it, it was resting on a crate.  With the
drain tube down inside the crate.
