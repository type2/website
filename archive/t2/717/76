Ah! So that's the mystery! From his description,  I thought it sounded
like he meant the shift rod sticking out of the transmission, but as
you said, I have never had the nose cone off, so I didn't know what it
looked like inside! So it had me having doubts, remembering that the
rod is joined with another dimple and set screw under the passenger
seat.

 the hockey stick is one of the only pieces you can see from outside
 the transaxle. Or at least part of it. The actual connection point for
 the shifter rod, is the end of the stick. Unless you pull off the nose
 cone it seems daffy that a round rod is called a hockey stick. However
 get it out and it makes a bend to become flat. Kinda looking like a
 hockey stick, but with the blade parallel to the ice surface instead
 of perpendicular. This thing has to be the correct size and
 configuration otherwise it will not operate the shifter levers in the
 transaxle.
