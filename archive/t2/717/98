Subject: [T2] No power sheet metal cutting

Jonathan's is the best suggestion so far, IMHO.  I know of one case where 
thieves used battery-powered disc grinders [larger scale Dremels] to cut locks 
and hinges... this happened last month at a friend's SCCA-racing-car workshop.  
Personally speaking of legal/ethical circumstances I would take my torches and 
tanks to the site and cut plenty wide, to allow for the distortion that results 
from flame cutting.  With any of these approaches on sheet metal, it would be 
wise to have a couple of buckets of water on hand... ;-))

the industrial option would be to rent a gas powered cut off saw from your
local rental store.
