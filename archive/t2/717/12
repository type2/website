Subject: RE: [T2] how to remove a fridge?

>>Anyone have a removal guide or some first hand knowledge?
(btw I am keeping the fridge etc to reinstall at a future date)<<

remove the passenger seat & you will see some bolts that secure the fridge
unit in place. i think there is also a bracket that holds it to the floor.

be careful when you unhook the propane sections.

good luck,
