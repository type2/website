I am not sure if this applies to the 5 Rib trans plus you have a 72 body,,, so
the differences make it difficult for me to answer..  but if this helps,, read
on

With the help of David  Schwarze and Marcus Schafer and Jamie Auch...
I put a 091 <6 rib> in my '74 body what was originally a 002 trans, dual carb
engine
at the same time,, I installed a 2 liter with Efi

Here is the list of changes I made in regards to the transmission
Swap bellhousing from 002 to the 091 to maintain the SR15 or SR17 starter[1]
Swap the 228 mm flywheel to the 210 mm flywheel clutch and pressure plate[2]
install the 1978 upper trans holder for the throttle cable tube location
install the 1978 straight shift stick
drill a new dimple in the hockey stick about 12mm closer to the nosecone

So, I ended up with a 091 transmission with a 002 bellhousing, the 210mm clutch
pressure plate and flywheel
this combination gave me 4.57 R&P with the 0.82 fourth gear . [3]
I really love it!


[1]  the SR15 manual, and SR17 automatic starter are a lot more plenitfull
here,, and cheaper than the SR86
[2] the 210mm flywheel are a lot more plenitfull here,, and cheaper
[3] I was able to count the teeth on the R&P but had to drive a fair number of
miles to guess that I had a 0.82 fourth gear,, I had all the rpm vs mph using
speedometer and roadside milemarkers... they were written on the windshield in
grease pencil,, and also in my now dead hard drive... both wiped out.

Hope that helps
Jamie Rivers
