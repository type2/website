Hi Stephen,

FWIW JDD is a Canadian.  During prohibition our ancestors' distilleries 
were working overtime trying to keep up with the demand for illicit 
alcohol to the south.

You can import a 15-year-old vehicle into Canada from the US with a 
minimum of hassle, but if you are importing from a different 
jurisdiction then the rules are different and I'm told there's a lot 
more red tape involved. Our family has imported several VW buses over 
the past few years from the US and it's never been a big problem.

There are a few brazilian buses in the US, but they are either re-VIN'd 
(quite illegal) or brought in as parts and licensed as home-built "kit 
cars".

Happy trails,

Dear John,

It may be a transatlantic misunderstanding, but you read rather 
sarcastic in that sentence. I had realised our two nations were 
different. Actually, my understanding was that the US and UK were 51 
different countries, with 51 sets of laws. We have a strange rule that 
people have to pay for a licence just to own a TV! You chaps once made 
alcohol illegal.  .
I only asked the question because I really wanted to know why it was 
illegal to import a Brazilian bus into the US until it is 25 years old. 
It cannot be safety or emissions, otherwise why let in 25 year old 
buses? I was also wondering if the law (if it exists at all, as you 
correctly point out) just applies to Brazil.
