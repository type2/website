Subject: windshield install question

i installed a windshield just now and the issue is i didn't want to force
something. the inner lip of the seal on the upper passenger side is about
1/4 from completely sat.i can see the old mark on the headliner left by the
previous seal - just on the right side from the rearview mirror about two
feet. should i slap it in with pressure or drive around and wait for it to
seat some on the sill, and then wap it? like a nit-wit i didn't use silicone
spray or any lubricant. - steve
