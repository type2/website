Come on - that must have been at least a little bit funny :)

I'm sure the Brazilians will sell buses to anyone who wants to buy em - in 
the case of Canada and our 15 year rule - the problem is not what Brazil 
will allow to export - the problem is what Canada will allow to import.  In 
the case of Canada its not that you can't import vehicles less than 15 years 
old from Brazil - its that you can't import them from anywhere EXCEPT - the 
U.S. unless the vehicle is listed on here

I believe that it's all about protecting the North American auto industry - 
old cars are not a threat to the industry - importing new cars is - I'm sure 
the powers that be would say its about safety and emissions - but, as you 
point out - that makes no sense if your are allowing older vehicles in - on 
the other hand - I suppose they would say that there are so few cars being 
imported that are older than 15 years old that the affect on emissions is 
insignificant and ... about safety ... I dunno.

IMO - you cannot expect to make sense out of these protectionist laws - 
unless of course you just acknowledge that they are protectionist laws.

BTW - We didn't make alcohol illegal in Canada - in fact, one of the richest 
families in Canada got rich by exporting Canadian alcohol into the U.S. - 
then - 50 years later after they were rich beyond comprehension - the 
Canadian government allowed them to move all that dough out of Canada and 
into the U.S. tax free - But I must say - a license to own a TV is silly.
