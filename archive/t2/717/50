Subject: Plastic Bus

We just picked up a truly cute little "Surf Bus" salt and pepper shaker 
while down at the Cocoa Beach (FL) Ron Jon shop.

It's about 8 inches long, has a cool surf/Tiki paint job, and while it 
is fired clay, it might work.

We've decided to paint our bus just like it, actually.

Stay tuned.
