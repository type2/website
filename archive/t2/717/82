Not in its entirety. Some pieces are not the same as on German busses. And
some are not sold separately (or not at a price that any reasonable person
would pay). But others are, and I already sell them. Much (but not all) of
the Bus sheet metal - and also the Bus body rubber - that I sell is genuine
Volkswagen/Brazil, out of the same production used for brand new Busses. The
quality is better than aftermarket, and of course the fit is perfect.

Again, unless it is 25 years old or older, in which case it is exempt.

Neither. Mexican Bus production ended a number of years ago, and production
for "Mexican" busses was moved to Brazil. There they made a Rabbit-engined
watercooled Bus exclusively for the Mexican market. (This version, which
looked like a German bus but with a plastic radiator grill on the front, was
not sold in Brazil.)  However, VW discontinued sales of the Bus in Mexico
entirely a few years ago. So now VW/Brazil now makes aircooled busses that
are intended only for their own domestic market (but sometimes find their
way to other South American countries, as well as overseas to the U.K. and
other countries whose import regulation is more lax).
