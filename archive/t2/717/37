Subject: Re: [T2] DVDA for $68?

If you buy the same part # from Cardone, it will have a different dist # in
the box at least 70% of the time. This tells me they are just trying to get
product out the door, they do not care whether it's actually "correct" for
the application the catalog states.

As I said before, most people do not care, nor do they notice (they just
want something that works that will pass emmissions), so they are better off
doing this then actually spending time to PROPERLY sort and setup the
distributors.
