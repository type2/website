They've got one of those beasts in the Wolfsburg Auto Museum.
They're somewhat different from German-built T2s.  Most notably,
they still have a removable rear apron, despite the TZb-ish
looks.  Bumpers and front doors are different too.  Build
quality on the one in Wolfsburg looks poorish, although that's
a deluxe model that's been made for some auto show IIRC -- lots
of chrome and leather in there.  I couldn't say if the regular
Brazil buses are any better, but I wouldn't be surprised if they
weren't.

Besides, Brazil buses of course still have the Type 1 engine. 
And they're awfully expensive.  At least here in Germany, where
buying a Brazil bus is at least a theoretical possibility (the
Brits import quite a lot of them, I understand), the kind of money
they cost will buy you at least two German T2s in as-good-as-new
condition.

Airhowlingly yours,
