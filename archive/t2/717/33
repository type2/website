Subject: Striped out Drain Plug update

My regular sized and oversized drain plugs arrived, no Timesert kit.  Next
weekend for this, I guess.

During this past week, the engine decided to start leaking oil.  I thought
it was the shaft seal behind the fan.  After removing some stuff and
removing the fan, it was not the seal.  The O-ring under the filler funnel
had gone bad.  I also think that my PCV valve may not be working properly.

I can not find anyone who had a new ones for a "CV" engine.

Part Numbers:

030-115-327A
030-115-427
071-101-105

Does anyone know where I can get these?

Thanks
