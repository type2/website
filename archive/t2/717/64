unfortunately the emissions stuff is very complex and is a combination of
state and federal rules.  some states have a rolling exemption for
emmisions some have a fixed date some don't have any requirement.  here
where I live Baltimore Maryland it is a fixed date emmisions but with
standards for passage being the model year built,  my 78 while over 25
years old still has to get emmissioned (passed it this past Feb)

so the emmissions stuff is very complex especially for older vehicles.

now there is one interesting exception, if you actually build a car
yourself (and yes I did do this) it does not need to be crashed or any of
those other things, but it still has to meet the safety and emmissions
rules and it will be very carefully inspected, then you have to figure out
how to insure it...it is a REAL PITA...
