Subject: Re: [T2] DVDA for $68?

From: "John Connolly"

you don't have to be a dickhead Karl. I'm just saying those distributors are
garbage, and they aren't worth $15 let alone $68. Oh yeah, they have a core
charge too. ;-) Those distributors are JUNK, and should not be seriously
considered by anyone unless broken down in BFE, but in that case the lowly
009 will get you home.

 that's a 72-72 unit, timed to 5ATDC at idle both hoses connected. I'm not at
work so the #s aren't handy (I do not have a manual here).

 I do not know if this was an April Fools Prank which I fell for, or a
legitimate question. But it's now April 2 and you are being a wanker. I'm
trying to help, that's all.

I am not being a dickhead or a wanker.

I asked a simple question and you wasted mine and everyone elses time with a reply that was half-baked because
you don't read. You just jumped in mainly to say you feel the Cardone product is crap. Fine, that is your
opinion. But to insult my and everyone else's intelligience and say to look in the Bentley for their rebuilt
dist specs is assine.

You are NOT trying help.
