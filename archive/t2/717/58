Subject: Re: [T2] Brazil-built Type IIs

The US and the UK are actually different countries and being different 
countries they actually have different laws.

BTW - you cannot import a Brazilian bus into Canada either (again - 
different country with different law) but here the rule is 15 years or 
older.

A critical legal thinker might think that its really just a pile o' BS in 
place to protect domestic manufacturers - a legal realist might say that 
different countries have different minimum safety and emissions standards 
that do not comply with ours, yours or his.

Could you import a Brazilian bus from the UK to the US?  Those goberment 
guys are pretty smart - I'm sure they have all the angles figured out - of 
course, I'm assuming that it really is illegal to import a Brazilian bus 
into the US that is less than 25 years old - just cause its been said 
doesn't mean its true.
