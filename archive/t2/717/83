I do, though I prefer the reinforced ones whenever possible. There's a
trick to using the little ones. Instead of following the cut line you
have to lift it out of the cut and press it in right next to the one
you just did... Kind of like cutting heavy cardboard with just a
pocket knife. You have to keep stabbing the cardboard to make the cut.

But doing things that way you can make some beautiful curves... Just
need to grind 'em smooth.
