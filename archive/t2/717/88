Subject: Engine compartment sound proofing

In the archive there are several examples of pretty involved sound
proofing projects

I am interested in reducing the engine noise heard in the cab, but not
really to in filling every hole and door panel of the bus with foam.

I'm thinking of two things.

1) I have the OEM cardboard with holes pattern holding some kind of
yellow synthetic "wool" at the top of the engine compartment. 34 years
later, is there something that does the job way better ? I'm
interested in keeping the look similar, but a small change is fine.
Budget : < 100$ . Anyone has done something that gave good results ?

2) Is it useful to put a sound proofing pad against the vertical wall
in front the the engine (just back of the tank) ? If not there, where
is the place that could benefit most from some "sound care" ?

Thanks - Arnaud
