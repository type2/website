Hi Dino,

This is going to sound primitive, but a hatchet and hammer will slice 
through sheet metal like butter once you get the hang of it. Even 
vintage OG steel will part like the Red Sea did for Moses once you get 
the technique mastered. I hammered a hatchet through the sheet-metal 
around the tail-light housings when I harvested the parts to create the 
westfakia; it was not difficult at all, but you will want a pair of 
snips or a hacksaw if you plan to cut through a seam.

Practice on a less critical area of the vehicle, and leave some room 
around the part you plan to keep so as to not stretch it.

Happy trails,
