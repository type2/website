Hi fellow Sunday listee's

The 25 year rule in the US creates classic car status for the vehicle.
Therefore, in all states except Cali, I believe, you are pretty much
free to run original emissions, safety etc... You can run with no
catalytic converter, restrictor, etc...

It cannot be safety or emissions, otherwise why let in 25 year old
Buses.
