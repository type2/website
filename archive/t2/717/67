Subject: No power sheet metal cutting

Hello All,

Was wondering if anyone could recommend some short of nibbler or other tool 
that does not require power (manual type cutter).  I wanted to cut some metal 
off a van that was not near a power source.  I have seen hand nibblers in the 
Eastwood catalog before... do they really work well? 

I have also seen battery powered sawzalls (18.? Volts), but I hate to buy one 
just for this purpose (I already have a regular wall AC type). 

By the way, what is the gauge of the sheet metal in a typical early 70s Type 
2?  18? 20? 

I bought a battery tray last winter (my second) and it just doesn't seem so 
thick. My last one only lasted 4 or 5 years. I put one of those mats under the 
battery.  I think it made matters worst.  Coated this new tray with Wurth Rust 
Guard and top coated it with Wurth Stone Guard. Hope that helps.

Thanks,
