There must be some local talent there, but I used to live in Red
Bluff, and Redding was just 30 miles away for me. Maybe within 100 for
you, but not a real good road. When I was there, I used to get parts
from Bus Boys. Scotty has a machine shop right behind Bus Boys. He was
pretty competent on the machine work on my engine. Not sure if he is
up to date on the latest techniques on valve seat issues on the Type 4
heads. You might enjoy the drive over just to get acquainted with Bus
Boys. Wolfgang is in Redding too. I think they have a machine shop
too. Al's Kraut is an excellent general service shop. Al must be one
of the nicest guys you'd ever meet, and he would bend over backwards
to do anything he can for you. He services heads too.

Good Luck,

John

 Hey there fellow enthusiasts of the VW. It is time to rebuild my 72 1700 bus.
 I live in Tahoe and I am wondering if there are any shops in the area (within
 100 miles) anyone recomends to buy parts and have machine work done on the
 heads? I can do most of the rebuild work myself, but I am not familiar with
 any shops in the area. Thanks
