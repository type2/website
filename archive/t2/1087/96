Subject: NGK Spark Plugs

My stockpile of spark plugs finally ran low and while trying to  
restock I've discovered that NGK has obsoleted a lot of my favorites.  
Local suppliers were unable to provide any plugs using their part  
databases thanks to superseded numbers but sometimes there was some  
old stock on the shelves.

To date, I haven't had any trouble ordering specific plugs from large  
online suppliers but I imagine stocks are going to dry up soon if NGK  
has truly obsoletely these plugs worldwide.

Obsolete:

- B6ES (7432) has been superseded to BR6ES (5371 -> 4922) which is a  
resistor plug.
- B5ES (6410) has been superseded to BR5ES (2246 -> 4722 -> 5866)  
another resistor plug.

The NGK reference has been incorrectly showing resistor plugs under  
Campmobile/Transporter for a long time even though B6ES was  
recommended by NGK for Porsche 914.

- BP6EY (7727) projected with v-power electrode (another favorite of  
mine) is obsolete.
- BP5EY (7327) projected with v-power electrode; ditto

- BP5ET (2287) expensive triple electrode version; appears to be gone.

Still available:

- BP5ES (7832 -> 6611)
- BP6ES (7911 -> 7333)
- BP6ET (1282 -> 1263) expensive triple electrode version.

So it would seem that only resistor plugs or non-resistor projected  
electrode spark plugs are available these days.

I'm not sure how long NGK has been using their latest packaging shown  
in the right in this photo...

... but it lead me to believe that these spark plugs were still in  
active production even though they were nowhere near the top 20 list  
of popular plugs (in fact non-resistor plugs never make that list).
