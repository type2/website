Should be no reason to rub the chokes. I wonder if your supports are
bent. If you need to straighten them, be sure to take them off the
carbs, otherwise you run the risk of breaking the carbs.

Gaskets are at the usual places. Bus Boys and Bus Depot make a good
start, their online catalogs are easy to use.
