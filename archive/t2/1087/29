Subject: 72' Rebuild Time (Reno/Tahoe)

Hey there fellow enthusiasts of the VW. It is time to rebuild my 72 1700 bus.
I live in Tahoe and I am wondering if there are any shops in the area (within
100 miles) anyone recomends to buy parts and have machine work done on the
heads? I can do most of the rebuild work myself, but I am not familiar with
any shops in the area. Thanks
 
Oh on a side note, I just got back from Burningman and I was amazed at how
many busses made it there. In fact there was a huge section that were only
busses. Made me smile :)
