Heres the link for Canada customs/immigration.
At this time Canada does not require a passport for US visiters. I couldnt
find the quote at this moment, but the guist was that Canada was not
subscribeing to the Western hemisphere travel initiative. I wish I could
find the exact quote, it was on the canadian gov website and was quite
droll. The problem of course is you need a passport to get back into your
own country.

I have never been asked for vehicle paperwork and that includes entering
Canada in a 66 split  with Wa collector plates and living in Canada.
Frankly, customs is only interested in weather you have guns, booze or
cigarettes and that upon entering the country you have the means to support
yourself while your here and that you will leave in the correct time span.
Mostly they want to tax the cigs and booze, keep the guns out of the country
and keep people from comeing up to use the medical plan. Ya I know, it takes
a year to get an X-ray, ; ) and we all live in igloos.

I dont know that they  would even care, a US citizen driveing thru to Alaska
in a legal titled and insured vehicle. Worst case scenierio I can think, is
that they might have you post bond to insure the vehicle leaves the county
which they would return at the Alaskan border.  Frankly I think I would just
tell them your on your way home to Alaska and leave it at that.
