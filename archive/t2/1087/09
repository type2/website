Subject: Beetle Drive show photos

Just got back from the "Beetle Drive" show that takes place at Crich Tramway 
museum, Derbyshire.

Despite the name there were loads of vans and so I took loads of photos, 
which can be seen at:

The event was fantastic with loads of smiling people, a couple of parades of 
cars and some vintage trams into the bargain.

Enjoy !
