Hi all,
last weekend, I took the bus to a small trip (300 miles) and took some
measurements with the wideband 02 sensor I just installed. Pics from the
install can be seen here:

It was quite a tight fit, but the unit works perfectly and this is what
I'm getting (Outside temp: 65F):

Speed |  RPM | CHT | AFR
------|------|-----|----
Idle  |  850 | 302 | 11.1
50mph | 2600 | 356 | 13.2
53mph | 2800 | 366 | 14.4
56mph | 2900 | 365 | 16.0
60mph | 3000 | 377 | 15.8
63mph | 3200 | 395 | 15.7

I stopped measuring when approaching 400. So, it seems I'm running too
close to stoich (when looking at the chart with CHT/AFR that was posted
last week) and that I should either run much leaner or much richer. What
are your opinions (this is a 2.0liter type4 in a '78 westy with standard
dual solexes)?
With these speeds, I can barely drive on the autobahn since I get
overtaken by every single truck. I only have to press the pedal very
lightly and still the temps creep up and are too high in my opinion.
Otherwise, the engine runs fine - the new exhaust is slightly louder
than stock but sounds nice.
Any help is greatly appreciated!
Cheers,
Timo
