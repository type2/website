Subject: heat exchangers and fresh air connector

I have a 73 bus with a 2000cc engine. I am doing the conversion of the 72-74
heat exchangers on the engine. The issue I am having is with the metal
connection tubes from the heat exchangers into the engine compartment that
hook into the paper tube that lead into the electric fresh air pump. I bought
the exchangers from busdepot.
http://www.busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=021256091MThe right hand head
exchanger has a round connection. My original has a oval connection and when I
talked to busdepot they said all have a oval connection and weren't sure why
they made it round. Has anyone else has this issue and what did you do or any
idea, thanks.
