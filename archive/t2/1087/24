Subject: Re: [T2] Camping Interiors

I agree, Europe (and the UK) have a better van market.  My sister  
drove around in a Ford Transit camper van for a year or so.  The  
problem with the US kits (Westfalia, ASI, ...) is that they are all  
directed towards the pop-top conversion.  So you end up with some  
pretty difficult to use pieces (sink/stove).  Not to mention how hard  
it is to get a complete matching set that aren't beyond repair.  If I  
have to re-veneer everything its easier to build my own to my specs.   
Maybe if I lived in California or Oregon I would feel differently.

I guess the main issue is that I'm trying to customize the bus to how  
I think I'm going to use it.  Plus, I've seen what's out there, like:

	http://www.calypsocampers.co.uk/baron.htm

which is really neat for my intended use.  You can get to the fridge  
without entering the bus, and the stove/work area is removable.  On  
the down side, since the cabinets are on the sliding door side, if  
you put a large wardrobe in visibility is reduced.  It's better to  
have that large cabinet on the driver's side (assuming you move the  
spare tire).

Also, I like the removable table set-up found in interiors such as:

	http://www.thecampershak.co.uk/products.php?subcatid=1

I guess the main problem is I haven't decided what compromises need  
to be made when selecting an interior.  Well, I'm still waiting for  
the bus to get painted, so I guess I have some time to mull it all over.
