Hey Ben,

I'm pretty inactive on the list these days since I don't have either of my
beloved buses anymore, but I read all the digests and love seeing everyone
still hanging out and having a good time together.  Anyway, I didn't see an
answer to your question about how to remove the "front trailing arms".  I
think you must be talking about the torsion arms since there's no such thing
as front trailing arms.  If that's true then you should check out the couple
of articles at www.Type2.com -> Technical Articles -> Ball Joints.  That
should tell you pretty much everything you never wanted to know about
removing the torsions arms.  They're not as easy as, say, removing a radio,
but are just simple attachments that can be handled as long as you take
things in stride.

Cheers.
