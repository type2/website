Customers returning good merchandise is always a risk for any
retailer. I would imagine it is worse in auto parts, at least for
things like fuel system and ignition parts, because of people not
being sure about what they are doing and not correctly diagnosing the
problem. I would imagine Airhead could sell those as "refurbished" at
or slightly above actual cost so that they are cheaper than new, and
yet still not have to take a loss on them.

I couldn't help but notice the 411 in your signature line. Do you find
the Type 4 engine in a car is much more powerful than in a bus?
