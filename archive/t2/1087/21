Subject: Camping Interiors

Has anyone had success getting new camping interiors for your bus?   
There are several interesting companies in Europe (http:// 
www.rvtec.co.uk/, http://www.calypsocampers.co.uk/), but I have yet  
to find anyone in the states.

I have a tin-top, so I'm looking for something semi-custom that works  
well without a pop-top (i.e. I probably will not cook in the bus  
since I would have to squat/kneel the entire time!).

TIA.
