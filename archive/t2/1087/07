Subject: Fuel injector wiring

I'm replacing all my FI connectors since they are all old and broken.
Which wire is + and which is - ?

For example, #1 injector has one wire labeled 14 and the other 51.
14 connects to the ECU plug, while 51 connects to one of the double-relay
connectors (I assume the series resistor).

So would 51 be positive and 14 be ground ?
