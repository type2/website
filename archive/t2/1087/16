Hi Douwe,

A mild abrasive and a scotch brite pad works well to restore the roof. 
After that's done you can decide if it needs paint or not.

If you do decide to paint it, I highly recommend "Interlux Premium Yacht 
Enamel. Get it from your local hardware store or from a marina. It's 
expensive, but a quart is enough to paint the roof with 2 coats with 
enough left over to do the bumpers as well.

Happy Trails,
