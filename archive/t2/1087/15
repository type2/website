Power wash it and keep jet away from the rubber seals. Sand it to get rid 
of the whiskers. Get some white marine enamel (yacht supply house or 
WalMart) for fiberglass and roller it on after masking everything. Read 
enamel label and note details. Don't breath the fumes. Two coats over 
several days worked wonders for me. Still good after 5 years.     Doyt in
