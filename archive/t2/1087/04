Part Numbers are:

211 405 669 Left Side
211 405 670 Right Side

Fits All Bay Window Buses ONLY 68-79

Pretty much a boneyard item (that's where I find mine), don't know of
anyone, even the first-line importers that even carry them.  The first
person I'd call would be Walter at Bus Boys (530) 244-1616 as they've had
good used ones in the past decade or so.  Chris at Busted Bus would be
another to contact.

Sorry, don't have any myself at the moment.
