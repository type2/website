Ratwell recommends using 3M Trim Adhesive to hold the cooper gasket in
place in the head while lifting the manifold into place. Coat both
sides of the gasket. He says that even though it will not survive
exhaust temps, when it carbonizes it will help seal the gasket.

 Hello, I am installing new exhaust manifolds on a 2000cc engine in a 73 bus.
 the Gaskets seem to set on top of the manifolds. I am laying under my bus to
 do this, the engine is still in the bus. Looking at this picture its looks
 like as I try to install the manifolds the gasket can get easily of center of
 the manifold and not give a good seal. Any one have some advise on this
 instillation on how to keep the gasket from moving as I install?
 Thanks!!Steven
