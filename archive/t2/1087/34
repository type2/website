Subject: Re: [T2] Camping Interiors

Right, I meant to mention that I've got a wife and 2 kids.   
Obviously, it would be quite a trick to all sleep in the bus, but I  
do need to carry stuff for four even if 2 are sleeping in the  
(attached) tent.

My uncle, the original bus owner, did a similar conversion when he  
took his son camping.  That was back in the 70's, and when he gave  
the bus to me the bed was long gone and just a back seat (and wood  
paneling) comprised the interior.
