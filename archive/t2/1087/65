I've had both types of exchangers, round and oval. Don't remember
which is which right off hand, but it means the riser from the heat
exchanger up to the engine tin is available with the round end too. If
you can't source it, or need an immediate solution, you can
temporarily cover the gap between the oval and round shapes with tin.
A quick find would be the top of a tin can of the same size.

The right hand head
 exchanger has a round connection. My original has a oval connection and when I
 talked to busdepot they said all have a oval connection and weren't sure why
 they made it round. Has anyone else has this issue and what did you do or any
 idea, thanks.
