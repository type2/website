The gray is probably from mildew.
I scrub mine now and then with a mix of bleach (and a little TSP if there is
anything besides mildew or algae). The bleach gets the mildew and algae, and
the TSP gets everything else. If you do this, be sure to work from the
bottom edges and move upwards. If you start from the top, the bleach will
run down the sides and cause streaking.

After rinsing and letting it dry I wipe on a coat of Penetrol. One
application lasts through the summer, and keeps it looking pretty good. Also
keeps it looking original.
