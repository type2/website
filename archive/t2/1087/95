Well, to legally drive an unregistered vehiclein California you need to 
have a temporary registration.  That registration should be good whereever 
you drive in the US and most likely in Canada.

If the vehicle is '74 or earlier you might be better off to just pay the 
man and get a current California registration.  If it's subject to smog 
this would complicate things.

The times I've crossed into Canada they've never even looked at the 
registration paperwork or stickers.  They were far more interested in 
making sure that I didn't have a gun or pepper spray and in making sure I 
was capable of paying my own way.
