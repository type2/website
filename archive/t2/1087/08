Usually the switched (ECU) side is negative.  That way if there's a 
short, it doesn't fry the computer.

Since the MegaSquirt also follows that format, and I essentially tied 
straight into the old L-Jet setup, the side that comes from the 
resistors would be positive, and the side that comes from the ECU would 
be negative.  You could easily verify this with a test-lamp by turning 
on the ignition and touching the wire coming from the resistors and the 
other end to ground - it should light the lamp.

Or, you could clamp the ground of the test light to ground, run the 
engine, pull off an injector plug, and touch it to the ECU line - it 
should do nothing.  Now clamp the ground of the test light to a +12v 
source (coil +) and then touch it to the same line - it should blink.

This might also provide some assistance:

You'll notice that one side of the injectors is tied to +12v while the 
other end is tied to inj1 and inj2.

In the end, I don't think it makes much difference which way you pull 
current through the injector.  They're just charging a coil so I doubt 
it would affect anything (kinda like lighting a bulb - polarity doesn't 
matter).  That said, I'd probably be picky about it, too ;)

Hope that helps!
