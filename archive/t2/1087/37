Subject: RE: [T2] Camping Interiors

Yeah .. from what I see .. it doesn't seem to make sense to import an
interior from the UK into NA ... I think you could have the same thing built
here for much less than the UK interior cost plus shipping .. although that
rvtec interior does seem much more affordable that the UK interiors. 

I'm in a very similar position with my 60 ... www.johndillon.com/fin ... I
have a westy bed from (I suspect) 68 to 71 bus ... fits much better than the
full-width bed I had from a 74 bus ... I have access to a kitchen thing from
a vanagon westy .. it's mint .. I was thinking about putting that behind the
non-walk thru bulkhead .. then a jump seat facing rear behind the driver ..
(maybe one of those fold down ones the UK buses have) .. a cabinet that runs
beside the 3/4 westy bed to the back .. then an over the bed cabinet .. but
my problem is .. if I do all that .. how do I make it all match .. I also
plan on adding a propane bottle underneath and a propex heater somewhere ...
