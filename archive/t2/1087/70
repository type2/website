This analysis is the opposite of the normal theory. As Air/Fuel ratios
approach stoichiometry (14.7:1) fuel economy increases, harmful
emissions decrease, power decreases, and temperature increases.

That is primarily what killed the air-cooled VW. As emissions control
standards demanded leaner fuel mixtures, the air-cooled VW ran too hot
for an engine which already pushed the metal temperatures close to
their limits.

My 74 with dual Solex PDSITs cruises between 11 and 12, and idles near
14. Hot rods also run in the 11 to 12 range for best power. If you are
getting 385 head temps with ambient temps of only 80 to 90, you are
running too hot. Type 4 heads start dropping valve seats around 425,
so I make 400 my maximum allowable head temp under any conditions.
I've cruised the freeway at 85 and climbed steep hills and never got
that hot, so 385 at an easy cruise of 70 in 80-90 ambient is too hot
in my estimation.

Hope this helps.

 Two things - first, what kinda AFRs are you getting around cruise?

 Between 12.5 and 14 when cruising at 65 mph (depends on load/uphill
 etc.).

 Sorry for the late reply, but you want to try and pull those AFRs down to
 15-16 at cruise.  At that point, you will see the temps start to drop.

 Just to give some perspective, I have been driving my bus in SoCal the past
 few days when the outside temps have been around 80-90.  On the freeway,
 going about 70, the highest the CHT got was around 385 with the AFRs
 hovering in the 14-16 range.  My AFR tuning is a little off right now
 (one-man tuning is difficult), so that's why I have the wide range...
