Yes that's my linkage.  Mine is also rubbing on the chokes.  You can
that's it
been rubbing there for quite awhile(before I got the bus). 
Your linkage seems
to lean( straight) towards the back of the bus more
than mine.  Is that
because of the gaskets too.  Which gaskets do I
need to get, and where?

Thanks alot
Richard
