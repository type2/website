The 411/412, although a pretty heavy vehicle in it's own right, is perhaps a
bit lighter than the Bus although I don't have the specs handy.  Still, the
1.7 coupled with the auto trans makes for a pretty peppy vehicle and
certainly so much more comfortable.  At freeway speed, it's almost like
gliding on air like a Cadillac.  It's only shortcoming is under built front
calipers and no power servo.  Gotta watch it when putting on the binders.
My buddy Cliff has a Calif plate that says 914WAGN on his 74 412 Wagon and
914SEDN on his 73 412 2 Door.  The 73 is a stick shift and it really moves
through the gears with a recently rebuilt 1.7.  The 411/412 has flat top
pistons, Buses have dished pistons, so that can make a difference.
