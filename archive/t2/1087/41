Subject: RE: [T2] Camping Interiors

My 60 had a bastard engine .. like many bastards it failed at under 40,000
mi .. it sat in a farmer's field for many years ... probably 2 or maybe 3
generations of kids had fun bouncing up and down on the roof .. it came from
the relatively salt-free Canadian Prairies .. soooo ... the roof had issues
but the rest of the bus was pretty solid .. that top is from a B.C.
conversion company called Dorper ... its bigger than a small westy top and
since it was going on a bus that would never have had a small westy top I
opted for the dorper top ... the hole is like 4" wider and 5" longer than a
westy top ... here is a more recent pic with some canvas in ... I still need
to get a headliner in .. I'm thinking about going with the original mohair
headliner rather than the Baltic Birch route .. I put the original interior
panels back in and they are about 7 or 8 out of 10 .. I have a few parts
from a Devon I'm using ... and in the UK they often turned standards rather
than kombis into campers with the original standard interior .. I kinda like
that idea .. but I can never 100% commit as to how to do the interior ..
