Which is specifically why I'm staying lower than lambda at cruise.

Well, if exhaust valves start burning when the temps are cooler, then 
I've got a problem :)

If I run at stoich, I will be over 400 in no time.  If I go richer than 
stoich, it will also run too hot.  If I go under stoich, it will run cooler.

There's a school of thought that if you lean your mixture, the engine 
will run hotter.  This is true under certain circumstances, which is 
when you're leaning *towards* stoich.  I am, however, leaning away from 
stoich - this, as the graph shows, drops head temps.
