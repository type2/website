	Internal cooling will help.  How much, and where to slap the 
water needle in, remains to be seen.
	One conclusion is convenient from my more recent work (mainly 
on motorbikes): exactly where you slap the water in is less important 
than I'd thought.  It definitely is best just outside the throttle 
butterfly, as I expound in my article, but it certainly gives better 
cooling at cruise if put in 'later' i.e. into the intake manifold.
	I'm not familiar with the vacuum nozzles  -  functional, or 
blanked-off  -  on your Solexes, but with luck there will be one 
intended for a vac-retard distributor.
	I would not contemplate any rejetting.
	A 3- or 4-litre water bottle can very likely be nicely tucked 
in at the lower rear of the body, under the engine compartment floor.

By all means ask me any q's.  I probably won't know the ans, but will 
try to help ...
