Subject: exhaust manifold copper gasket instillation

Hello, I am installing new exhaust manifolds on a 2000cc engine in a 73 bus.
the Gaskets seem to set on top of the manifolds. I am laying under my bus to
do this, the engine is still in the bus. Looking at this picture its looks
like as I try to install the manifolds the gasket can get easily of center of
the manifold and not give a good seal. Any one have some advise on this
instillation on how to keep the gasket from moving as I install?
Thanks!!Steven
