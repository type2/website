Subject: Re: [T2] Hello and fuse box picture request

I didn't see anyone get back to you, so I went out to take a pic for
you. Mine is a 1974, but would think it wouldn't be much different, if
not identical. Relays are a bit difficult to see as they are behind
the plastic guard wall. Hope these help.

. I need a picture of an installed fuse box
 from a 1970 EZ camper. More specifically, I need to see the flasher relay
 and dimmer relay positions in the fuse box when it's installed. I have
 searched the history and archives of the list online and continue to search
 the internet, but any help would be greatly appreciated.
