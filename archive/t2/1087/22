Subject: Re: [T2] Camping Interiors

There were a few stretching back almost 35 years, such as EZ-Camper, ASI
(Riviera), Adventurewagon, Z Products, etc.  But all have past into the dust
of history due to a very shrunken and alm call for a Camperost non-existent
market.  There just isn't enough people out there to justify continuing
production, so most people wanting to do this salvage existing camper
interiors from too-far gone Buses headed to the crusher.  About 10 years ago
I came into possession of a beautiful, complete deluxe westy interior
w/fridge & stove out of a 76.  Took me 5 years to sell it and I lost my
shirt - never again.

Over in Europe, they have a lot more viable market for this, very niche,
especially since they have a better van (ie: makes) selection that will
never see the light of North America.

First place I'd call for a good used camper interior would be Chris at
Busted Bus in Colorado or Derek at Way Out Salvage in Kingston, Arkansas.
