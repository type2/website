John,
Wow, That is one nice looking pop top split you have there!

Chris
64DD camper.

the UK interiors.

I'm in a very similar position with my 60 ... www.johndillon.com/fin ... I
have a westy bed from (I suspect) 68 to 71 bus ... fits much better than the
full-width bed I had from a 74 bus ... I have access to a kitchen thing from
a vanagon westy .. it's mint .. I was thinking about putting that behind the
non-walk thru bulkhead .. then a jump seat facing rear behind the driver ..
(maybe one of those fold down ones the UK buses have) .. a cabinet that runs
beside the 3/4 westy bed to the back .. then an over the bed cabinet .. but
my problem is .. if I do all that .. how do I make it all match .. I also
plan on adding a propane bottle underneath and a propex heater somewhere ...
