Hey gang,

Check out the video.  Kevin decided to cut a good van in half and
have it protrude out of his upstairs loft as sleeping quarters for his son and
an extension to his house.  We are crazy in New York and we will do anything
for excitement.  Not even Fryday Yet.

  
The video is up on the Limbo site.
