Another article I wrote this past year for Airhead Parts (shameless plug) is
also a good resource.  Airhead/VWG includes a copy of this with every
H30/31PICT and 34PICT-3 Carburetor they sell.  Since doing this, the
comebacks have fallen to less than 1% of those sold.  I've gotten several
compliments from customers, so I must have done something right ;-)
