Sorry for the late reply, but you want to try and pull those AFRs down 
to 15-16 at cruise.  At that point, you will see the temps start to drop.

Just to give some perspective, I have been driving my bus in SoCal the 
past few days when the outside temps have been around 80-90.  On the 
freeway, going about 70, the highest the CHT got was around 185 with the 
AFRs hovering in the 14-16 range.  My AFR tuning is a little off right 
now (one-man tuning is difficult), so that's why I have the wide range...
