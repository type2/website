The numbers don't lie :)

Actually, my engine will probably have worse emissions when I set it to 
stoich or richer.  The engine *should* be somewhere around stoich as 
that's what the cat wants to see.  Make it leaner and the NO goes up, 
but temps come down.

Now, if I were to change the cam and the exhaust, then yes, my temps 
would probably come down considerably, but I need to make sure it will 
pass smog.

I'd love to get it cooler, but no combination of stock parts for a 78 
has been able to yield a cooler running engine (besides the custom EFI). 
  You also have to understand that you have a different year with a 
different exhaust (I'm assuming here).  The earlier exhaust is known to 
run cooler.

The goal here is not power, because then yes, I'd be running around 
12-13 (which I do under load).  The goal is to keep it as cool-running 
as I can, while deviating as little from stock so that it still passes smog.

That said, I'm debating changing out to the same cam that's in the 
camper special engine because my bus passed smog by a mile.
