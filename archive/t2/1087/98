I stopped measuring when approaching 400. So, it seems I'm running too
close to stoich (when looking at the chart with CHT/AFR that was posted
last week) and that I should either run much leaner or much richer. What
are your opinions (this is a 2.0liter type4 in a '78 westy with standard
dual solexes)?

Posting data? Heresy! :)

Thanks for the O2 sensor install pics. I am about to do the same install
on the same style exhaust.

A couple of questions. First, what is your current jetting? Second, what
is the timing set to? I read yesterday the suggestion to alter the
maximum centrifugal advance +/- 2 deg from a starting position of 28
deg. I haven't tried it but it's worth a try.

Martin.
