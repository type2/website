Subject: Re: was Crossing into Canada ...how about AK Ferry?

I do want to thank all for this suggestion, I pmailed on the first one.  We
had considered it.  The marine highway is quite scenic, but....
 
Time does not permit because in "winter" season (we will be going in October,
just) the Bellingham ferry runs only on Friday which doesn't work for us, we
are going for a memorial service on Saturday, and need to leave by Monday at
the latest.  Also the ferry gets only to Skagway in "the winter."  Skagway is
a good solid 2 days drive onto Anchorage (roundabout where I'm going.)  Then
there is always the fact it is pricey as hell as well.
 
So a great idea in concept, just not in practice.  In honesty the smartest
thing to do is just stomach the $1650 they want to ship the vehicle out of
Tacoma and drive it up and fly back after spending a few days in Seattle, but
we are sort of wanting to do the drive.

Instead of driving and paying over $1 per litre of fuel in Canada, you could
take the ferry from Bellingham, WA to AK... probably still more expensive but
you go along the "cruise ship" route and see the same scenery as the love boat
etc....and you'll never have to worry about the border guards or hitting a
moose along the way.
