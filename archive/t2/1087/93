I'll second that.  Unlike a Bug, the bus has nearly a 50-50 weight 
distribution and a fairly high load on small tires.  They don't take to 
sand too well.  Carry a shovel and a couple of 10-foot strips of carpet 
and drive only where the sand is firm.  If it starts to dig in stop 
immediately.  Don't bury yourself!  Usually the best way out is the 
reverse of the way you came.

Personally, taking my bus anywhere near salt water would give me the 
willies!  :)
