The problem is the supplying warehouse/importer cannot return the
Brosol/Bocar Carburetor to the manufacturer, which I feel is bogus IMHO.
This is not a problem with the Euromax or EMPI Carburetors (both Chinese
made) as they will take 'em back with no questions.

Before writing the article, I tested each returned carburetor on a variety
of Beetle/Bus engines and found only just a fraction actually bad.  A couple
leaked (EMPI), one had a bad choke (EMPI).  Every Brosol/Bocar checked OK
when properly installed.  Have had NO problems with the Euromax.  Of course,
they couldn't be re-sold as new, so Airhead had to "eat" the Brosol/Bocar
carbs (these aren't cheap).
