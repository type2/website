Subject: Re: [T2] Having problems with westy linkage

yeah. i have 2 engine im looking at right now. a '74 auto and a 73 manual.
the auto has those bakelite gaskets and the manual has the think aluminum
gaskets. the bakelite sets the carbs about a half an inch farther away from
each other. linkages on the the two i think are the same though. i dont
think it matters what gaskets you use.

the only difference i have found in linkages that i know of is the change
from 72 to 73-74. the 72 is a straight bar, the other years is a bent bar to
clear the air cleaner. maybe this is your prob? the 72 intake manifolds sit
lower and may be spaced differently? or can you adjust the  brackets that
come off of the carbs slightly in to hole the linkage?
