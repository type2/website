Subject: Forgot oil cap- why did it NOT blow all over?

Hmmm, re oil temp gauge reliability-never had trouble with the Taylor 
digital meat thermometers in our 2 busses!  Now explain this O list- 
last week, while in a hurry, I forgot to put the oil cap back on our 78 
after adding a qt and drove 160 mi and there was NOT oil all over the 
back- this was the 246,0900 original mi engine    -with expected blowby, 
shouldn't it blow out the fill pipe top?  Normally I do lose oil from 
rear seal or oil cooler seals if driving too fast or oil is still cold.
Normal oil pressure when hot is about 20 now, 5 at idle.
