I just went through all this "what-ifs" with the
Washington State Patrol inspectors. A bus I bought had
a replacement dashboard and the VIN # was screwed on
with phillips head screws AND still not the right VIN
number. The # on the door pillar has been painted
over. The number on the frame in engine compartment
and the one on the passenger seat-back are correct and
match the title.

I was told that it is illegal to tamper with a VIN
number in any way. They and only they can attach a VIN
number and if there is a question about what the VIN
number actually is, and the vehicle passes muster as
far as legality issues, they assign a generic VIN
number to the vehicle.

I want to remove the seat backs and figured I could
attach that VIN # to the dashboard location - better
than nothing I figured. They said WRONG! THEY will
attach it and only to the door pillar. 

They also informed me that the troopers are instructed
that if they find a vehicle which has a tampered-with
VIN# they are to immediately impound the vehicle FIRST
and ask questions / listen to explanations / look at
documentation LATER!  Now that has me worried, cuz
whenever someone looks at that standard VIN# location,
they will see it has been tampered with. If I am not
there with the vehicle, it is very likely to get
towed. I haven't figured out a solution, but I'm
working on it.

BTW - one of the inspectors is restoring a camper bus.
That helped me to get the information I needed! -BaH
