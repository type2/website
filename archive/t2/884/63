Subject: How to clean MAF sensor

My MAF has been sitting on the shelf too long...  what I thought would be a few 
days before reinstall turned to several months.  Had I known, I would have 
wrapped it carefully in a poly-bag; as it is, the sensor has accumulated a coat 
of dust and a few cobwebs.  Someone on this list, IIRC, wrote about cleaning, 
maybe with Tuner Spray??  Any thoughts will be apprec.... :-))  Thanx, Glenn
