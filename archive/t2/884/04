Karl, you make that sound SOO easy.  I suspect that wouldn't be  the case for me.  But I'm going to find out one of these  days.  Hopefully not for a while.  Cheers...KR

With just a good used head, I have done this job easily by myself in my driveway in one day........ the 1/2
side is a lot easier than the 3/4 side!

Drive bus up ramps, jack up rear of bus and use tall kack stands,  drop engine, remove exhaust, remove intake,
remove tin, remove head, clean tops of P&C's, install head, clean tin, reinstall all pieces, install engine,
lower bus off jack stands, drive away.
