Yes, bus air cleaners do not have vacuum going to
them. 
68-70, the flap is controlled by a cable coming off
the flaps in the shroud. On 71, the cold air flap is
thermostaticly controlled.

Ghia's have a vacuum controlled cold air flap.

When I get home, I will send the different part
numbers of the air cleaners.
