I originally had an AC compressor on my bus so it had that second pulley
in front of the fan, I looked at using that to drive a second alternator
that was mounted where the old AC compressor hung.  the numbers never
really made it look like it was worth the work involved.  I haven't given
up on it but it is not on the front burner either.   would be interesting
if I could get an alt/motor in there and use the second battery to power
the motor for a little extra when I was starting up or needed a little
boost on a hill.
