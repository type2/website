I'm afraid I won't be going to Bonaroo until I'm payed to play  there.  Too many people, too much mud, and I'm getting too old for  that kind of partying.  The traffic jam will probably start around  Murfreesboro.   Have fun, though.  Cheers....KR

A group of us are meeting at the Wally World in Manchester wicked early
Thursday morning and are going in together. We don't have a specific time -
maybe 5am or so? Just a few of us on the samba boards are going to try and
meet up.
