Subject: Daytona trip, and a lying gauge

Hi All, 

Got back from a weekend trip to Daytona last night.  It's about 300
miles round trip, and one of the most common trips my wife and I (and
our 3 large dogs) make.  Bus ran like a champ, though I realized the
need for a few things to add a bit more "creature comfort" to the whole
deal.  

The oil temp gauge played up on the way over to Daytona, though.
Cruising along I-275 at ~75mph, the bus usually sits at around 350 deg
CHT, and ~210 deg oil temp.  These vary a bit, but I've checked 'em with
an infrared thermometer, and they're pretty accurate.  I noticed oil
temp climbing fairly rapidly, so I slowed down.  CHT dropped, but oil
temp kept climbing.  When we stopped at a quickie mart, I popped the
engine hatch to see what the heck was going on.  Oil level was normal,
and hot, but not the skin-searing 240 degrees the gauge said it was.
Especially since there was no obstruction of airflow anywhere (no bags,
no leaves, nada.)  CHT settled down to 330-ish range in the parking lot.
When we left back out, CHT came back up to 350 deg, but oil kept
climbing.  The gauge read 250 deg, but CHT was still 350 deg, and the
bus was running like a top.  No sputtering, no pinging, not down on
power, nada.  I knew the gauge was lying.  Sure enough, a few miles
further down the road, it starts bouncing wildly between 300+ degrees
and 200-ish degrees.  Then it pegged at 300+ for the rest of the trip.  

Connection at the sump-mounted sender are questionable, but there's also
the possibility that the insulation has abraded off somewhere as it
snakes to the back of the bus.  So sometime this week I'll re-wire the
gauge.  Just another example that you can't always trust your gauges.  

The creature comforts will be in another post.
