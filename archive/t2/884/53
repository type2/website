 so i plan on pulling both heads on my 75 FI auto tranny.  i'm looking (-at-) the
busdepot remanned heads ref #02210106hx.  two questions.  should i replace
3/4 when i do 1/2? pros and cons?  anyone used this part and how did it
perform?  do i need to replace the head studs or bolts?  and finally what is
lapping?  some of you may be begging me to find a good mechanic at this
point or any mechanic but i'm going to try this myself.  damn the
reprecussions, full speed ahead.  by two questions i actually meant more
than two.
