Subject: Re: [T2] Replacing my crankshaft seal, do I need the tool

I copied the pattern of the flywheel bolts onto a metal plate (Home 
Depot, solid cover to a 4" square shop outlet box) and drilled it. 
Place seal, then cover and bolts, and tighten evenly all the way around 
in a star pattern to evenly push the seal into place.  Using a hammer 
can easily tear the seal edge without being noticed if you are not 
experienced.
