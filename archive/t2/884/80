Subject: Gaskets and things...

Hey guys,

      Is there a big difference between the front door gaskets made in Brazil and the front door gaskets made in Germany? I bought gaskets for my front doors.. I don't know where they were made, but they seem to never fit right. It's next to impossible to close the door. I literally have to SLAM the door with all my might to get it to shut completely. That was like 3 years ago, and still no change. 

One other thing, I hate to have to ask this yet AGAIN... but someone mentioned to me that there was a tri-gauge cluster that would fit in the 3rd gauge pod in the stock gauges. I think it was from a VW Fox? It used VDO gauges and had oil pressure, voltage, and vacuum or something like that. Does anyone know where I can get that?


Thanks!

Todd
