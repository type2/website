Todd asked:

 I've got a few questions though that I'm hoping you guys might be able to answer:

 1 - What do I need to replace in the shifter so that the shift from 1st to 2nd
is so difficult? It really WANTS to go into reverse when I try to go to second.

* Find 2nd gear. Leave the shifter in 2nd. Loosen the two bolts holding the shifter to the floor. Get a
screwdriver and push the plate between the floor and the shifter base towards the drivers side til it stops.
Tighten both bolts.


2 - Where can I get some of those new machine screws for the tin work? I need
at least 10 screws. Is there a hardware kit I can buy for my Bus? The local
yard currently does not have any busses in it, and Busted Bus is in the process of moving.

*  type 4 engines should have phillips head pan screws.
    type 1 engines use straight slot cheese head screws.

3 - Is there a new replacement engine tin "kit"? If I have to go back and do
this over again in a few years for whatever reason, I'd really like to replace
it with all new pieces, preferably aluminum. Just curious if anyone has
bothered to remake these?

* Not that I know of..... good used is your only choice.
