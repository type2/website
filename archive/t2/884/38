Subject: Replacing my crankshaft seal, do I need the tool

I finally got to pulling my engine this morning (took
the week off) to check on an oil leak. It is coming from
the crankshaft seal, it's hard as a rock. Anyway I
went to order a new seal on line and then got a message asking
if I want to order the install tool for the seal. Do
I need that? The old one came out real easily with a
little prying. I've never done this before so need
some advice.

Thanks,
Kevin
