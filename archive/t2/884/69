That's unfortunate that they're so strict over there. I wonder if the guy you were talking to was just trying to be all fancy pants and make himself sound cool. 

If it is true, then that kind of sucks for me. I went through all teh effort of drilling out the rivets on my original VIN plate, got rid of the old dash panel, got a new one from Busted Bus, sanded and painted it, and then attached my original vin plate to my new dash with regular rivets. But, that wasn't before I stripped the paint off the vin plate, and painted it a nice bright aluminum color.
