The A/C idea has a lot of merit.  Why put the evap coil in the front?  You
could put it on the side, or behind the rdivers seat, duct or use vents to
direct it where ever you need it to go.

BTW, are you sure the RY air was 12V at 11-18 amps?  I had one on the roof
of my RV, and it was 110V at 15 amps.

work well for the driver/passenger, and they're expensive as heck.  I'm
currently searching for a unit from an RV (in the 8-12K BTU range) to
strip down and mount in the passenger side of the engine compartment.
Run the condenser coil underneath the bus, run the evaporator coil to
the front, add a blower/controls/etc.   Probably have to step up to a
95A alternator to pull it all, and add an idle kick-up selenoid.
So far the units I've looked at are small enough to fit (with the
coils relocated), but require 12v at 11-18A to operate.  Of course the
smallest new unit I've seen is 11K BTU also.  Plenty of cold for the
people up front, and in the back of the bus.
