I originally had an AC compressor on my bus so it
had that second pulley
in front of the fan, I looked at using that to drive
a second alternator
that was mounted where the old AC compressor hung. 
the numbers never
really made it look like it was worth the work
involved.  I haven't given
up on it but it is not on the front burner either.  
would be interesting <SNIP>

I never said it would be easy - just that it seems to
be the only logical place to put it unless you use a
Vanagon case and convert all the support systems. The
small pulley is also a problem as it would have to be
nearly as big as the original pulley and if I remember
correctly, there isn't THAT much room! The way my 1000
watt microwave pulls my subey down from 2000rpm, I
think I'll just stick with the little cooling fan
mounted beside me. Seems like working the engine that
much harder isn't gonna make for much "cooler!"
But if it works... (!) -BaH
