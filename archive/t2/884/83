Subject: Next question - the charcoal filter

Anybody able to take a picture of the correct air box for my 71.  The 
charcoal filter has inlet (from fan shroud) and has inlet from tank and 
than an outlet which goes nowhere.  It seems I'm short of anywhere to 
send this outlet to on my airbox as it only has one nossle for the 
crankcase breather.

thanks

Lee
