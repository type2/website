WOAA!!! What was that rusty tube a picture of? Was that the tube that's part
of the frame that connects the two front wheel assemblies?! I had no idea
they could rust that bad!!! How come everything else is perfect, but that tube
is rusty?

The A/C install looks really nice! What did you do in the engine compartment
in terms of A/C compressors? Did you install another pulley on the fan?
