Subject: Re: [T2] Swivel seat base?

David asked:


Anyone have a swivel seat on the in there Bus?  How thick are they (from
bracket slide bracket to where it's welded to the seat itself)?

I am totally confused by your question.

The swivel base is bolted to the floor. The seat tracks are on the top half of the swivel base. NOTHING is
welded to the seat. The left and right seats are swappable and switchable with Vanagon seats.

You will need a bay Westy passenger seat pedestal to cut out inorder to install a swivel seat in a bay.

A perfect example is here of a swivel base is here:
