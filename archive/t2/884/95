 Thanks for the picture Jamie,  Karl is this for sure as it looks pretty 
 much the same shape as my '71 bus one ?

FYI, that is a Ghia air filter, NOT a 71 bus air filter....

If you have two vacuum ports on top of your "71 bus" air cleaner....... you have a Ghia air cleaner!! 
The bus air cleaner does not have vacuum ports.

Look at the part number on the air inlet:

71 Bus:
Knecht =  662/6 and on the top LB 662/1-504M1
Mann = 211 129 607 C and on the top 37 028 58 211


Ghia 72-Early 73 (To Oct 72)
Knecht =   211 129 607 A = 13mm Oil Breather Fitting

Ghia Late 73-74 (Fr Nov 72)
Knecht =  211 129 607 F = 18mm Oil Breather Fitting
Mann = on top 37 028 58 261
