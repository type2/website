Subject: Re: [T2] Source for gas filler rubber hose

Hi Lee,

NAPA sells 2 1/4 inch fuel filler hose which is the right size for the 
71. The NAPA part # is 1055-NBH. Searching for 'fuel filler hose' in the 
archives will yield some hits suggesting various marine hoses, etc. but 
if you have a NAPA near you that is probably the easiest place to get it.

p.s. I just noticed your uk email address. If there is no napa over 
there, check their web site they say that you can shop from the internet:

Good Luck,
Bill
