"A new Volkswagen minivan based on the next-generation Chrysler and Dodge
minivan platform, which will be sold only in North America, will be produced
beginning in 2008. Chrysler Group President and CEO Tom LaSorda said, "With
our manufacturing and platform engineering flexibility, we can deliver a
high-quality product specifically tailored to Volkswagen's customers' tastes
with little or no substitution effect on the current Chrysler and Dodge
minivan lineup."
