This is very true. On my 1981 TransAm, the original title was missing one of it's digits... it looks like the printer that printed it had run out of ink on the last two digits and you could barely make them out. When I first registered it in my name two years ago (from the original title from the only other owner), they sent me a title with the two digits missing. I made a photocopy of the original title and that was the only way I had known that they were missing. (I had hand written the last two digits on the copy). I had to have them re-issue one. I had to fill out some sort of form.

And on another one of my cars, a 1984 Pontiac Fiero 2m4 SE, it comes up 90% of the time (to insurance companies and whomever else) as a 1984 Pontiac 6000 STE??? I don't know who's fault that is...

This is good to know! I wasn't aware that the vin was anywhere else other than on the dash!
