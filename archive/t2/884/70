Subject: VPC under-dash vents wanted

I am looking for the vent outlets for a VPC under-dash unit.  If anyone has
a junk unit with vents intact, I would like to purchase them from you!

I have a bunch of parts for a different type of A/C system. I don't know if
it's original or not but I found it on a Camper Bus in the junkyard several
years ago. It fits directly underneath the dash board. It has the EXACT same
material and in the exact same color as the dash. It's that matte crinkle
finish. The knobs, fans, all that stuff also match the stock VW stuff.

Anyway, the ONLY thing I have is that unit (which contains the fans and
electronics) and the A/C compressor (which appears to be a BOSCH). Would you
happen to have the evaporator / condensor? (or whatever that huge radiator
thing is?)

If you have any of that stuff, I'd be really interested...


Thanks!!!

Todd
