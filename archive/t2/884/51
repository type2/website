Subject: oil-P gauge t-junction?

	To get an oil-P gauge on my '73 1600cc, can I slap a 
t-junction on the oil-P warning-light sender?
	If so, can anyone let me know the specs for the t-junction? 
The auto accessory folks here have no way to look this up; they don't 
know what thread etc.
	Is an electric gauge better than a mechanical type?  I have a 
mechanical one on another rear-engine vehicle (Renault 10) with no 
trouble after some years, but that length of max-pressure oil pipe 
makes me slightly nervous because it could get breached one way or 
another ...  so I tend to the electric oil-P gauge for that reason.
	Any advice gratefully rec'd.


thanx
