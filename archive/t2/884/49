Hi Bob,

Someone had an idea a while back to get an original AC setup, and  
find a domestic alternator of the correct size to replace the AC  
pump . That would give you a dual-alternator system and a LOT of  
spare juice to run the AC.

OTOH... converting rotational force into electrical energy that will  
be used to spin a motor doesn't make sense to me. Too many  
conversions wastes power, and there isn't all that much HP there to  
start with.

One thing we haven't heard from Shad is what year bus he has.  
Throwing that load at a stock early bay engine might be a wee bit  
optimistic.

Happy trails,
