Subject: Re: [T2] Next question - the charcoal filter

Lee asked:


 Anybody able to take a picture of the correct air box for my 71.  The 
 charcoal filter has inlet (from fan shroud) and has inlet from tank and 
 than an outlet which goes nowhere.  It seems I'm short of anywhere to 
send this outlet to on my airbox as it only has one nossle for the 
crankcase breather.
