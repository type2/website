2" receiver Trailer Hitch to fit 80-91 Vanagon.

NEW 2" receiver Trailer Hitch to fit 80-91 Vanagon.

Receiver is slighly off center!  It was not supposed to be that way....
In all other ways it is correct.. if you don't mind using it this way.......
my mistake is your gain.....  us$130.00 shipped from Quanah, Texas 79252

somehow the reciever is 1.25" off center....
Painted Black.

Very similar to the one in this picture.. with a 2" receiver
