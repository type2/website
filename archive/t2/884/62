My deluxe has factory/dealer AC and it looks just like this one on the 72.
I'll try to take pics of my whole setup before I pull it all - it's missing
whatever part lives in the engine compartment and I want to loose all that
dead weight.

I'm wondering if my stuff could be of use for anyone - like for this 72 or
anyone that wants to try and get AC working - I'm running out of room for VW
junk - I mean stuff.
