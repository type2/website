up to the salt air better than straight enamel. I wonder who the 
manufacture of that paint was? It would probably last forever on a bus

It's not "just" the paint...Almost any industrial type paint will meet
"mil. spec" (the brand name manufacturers don't want to be left
out.) It's the drying time that's the problem. You need a dust-free
room to use slow drying oil enamels. (Trivia question: Why WERE
Model T's black ?-)
