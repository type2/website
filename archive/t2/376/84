Subject: Need a decel valve

Hello all,

I have come to the disapointing conclusion that I need a new decel valve on my
78. I thought that I had it tracked down to a bad vacuum hose but after
replacing all hoses and clamping them on, the bus still idles high after it
warms up. As per the Bently if I pinch the large hose from the decel valve to
the air intake boot the idle imediately drops to where it should be. When
these valves go bad do they all of the sudden go? Mine seems to be
intermittent. In any case does anyone have an extra decel valve that they
would like to part with? I know that they are NLA and to my knowledge nobody
makes them after market. Is there a test for these when they are off of the
engine if I can find one at a salvage yard?

One more question. Will having the decel valve leaking cause a rich or lean
condition?

Thanks for any help.
