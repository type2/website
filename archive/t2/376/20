Subject: Emergency Falser *%#**** mess

The top broke off of my emergency flasher knob and I bought a new one.
Friend gave me one that was a little different from my bus. I think it was a
later year. My bus is a 69 and I made it semi work with turn signals so I
could go to circle your wagons. I P/U a used one and hooked it up and I
still dont have any brake lights. I also dont have any running lights on
the driver side rear If anyone can help or give me colors  to Number I would
be in your debt.
