HI Jason,
	Well you dream may be closer than you think. Not yet for carriers
but for the aircraft on them anyway.  3M has been developing film coating
sets (Decals in a sense) for combat aircraft.  The logic behind this is
three fold 1) a fighter gains approx 600lb in weight over it's lifetime
even though it is stripped at every repaint, 2)the paint residue after
stripping has to be dealt with as hazardous waste 3) the turn around time
is fast and fume free.  The film is applied with all the markings in the
correct locations minimizing surface imperfections and at the end of it's
life it is removed using heat to soften the adhesive.  

Not sure that we all could agree on the same (grey) color scheme for our
buses nor where to put the "cut here for emergency access" marking :0)

I have used 3M Polyurethane Protective Tape 8663 Clear, 4 in x 36 yd, 2
per case (commonly know as 'blade tape' in the helicopter industry) as a
protective layer on the front end of vehicles.  Typically under the
windshield on my Vanagon or the front edge of the hood on a front engined
car or other high impact area.  Very clear and durable. Has not peeled the
paint in my experience.  Guaranteed bug proof at any bus velocity and
really helps to keep stone chips to the minimum.

I must admit it would be quite a site to behold if any of our naval
aircraft carriers pulled into port sporting a new wet sanded look. :)
Perhaps they could trim the ship in chrome as well.
