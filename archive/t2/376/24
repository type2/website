Hey now!

Bite your tongue and watch what you say!!

Some of us girlfriends have successfully pulled, rebuilt and reinstalled 
running engines.

I know I have.

My father is horrible at car maintenance, and we have to take care of a lot 
of stuff for him that he just won't/can't do.  You don't see me (as a woman) 
dissing him (as a man) for this.

Loving and caring for a VW is a state of mind, not gender!

'78 2.0L Westy with newly rebuilt engine
and yes, I did it myself
