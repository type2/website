Subject: RE: [T2] paint jobs

You can do it all kinds of ways.  I've brush painted without washing
first and gotten a good shiny durable paintjob, but that isn't the
recommended way to go.  Modern paints are quite expensive and I've spent
$300-$600 on good paint in the past. You can brush on Yacht enamel in
thin coats and build up a very nice smooth finish.  As has been said,
most of the work is in the preparation...sanding, mainly. One reasonable
approach is to deal with all the body issues one at a time...sand, fill,
sand, prime, sand, topcoat with rattle can.  Then go back and paint the
whole car when all the body issues are covered.  You can sand the whole
car down one time with 220 grit sandpaper, rinse, dry, mask and paint in
an afternoon and have a paintjob that looks really good and will last a
long time; but it won't be perfect, by any measure.  I've spent about 40
hours wetsanding,  starting with 180 grit and ending up with 400 grit,
before painting.
My theory of that there no amount of sanding is too little, no amount is
enough, no amount is too much.  Just sand as much as you want to then
paint.
It is really important to spend a lot of effort wiping the surface with
tacky cloths, to get dust and grit off.  Once you go to the effort to
get a smooth finish, you can mess it up in a hurry with dust.
