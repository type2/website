Not hard, I just bought a length of euro style brake line from the local flaps 
and a bender and it went in with little difficulty. Beware, the place I went to 
didn't have the correct length so I had to put a couple of extra bends in it to 
take up the slack so to speek. I works fine though. If you can afford it get a 
flarer and cut it to length then flare the end (making sure the nut is still 
on) and you'll have a easier time getting it to fit.
