My bus is a combination of original 70 California oxidized paint, and
touched up where needed with Tremclad rust paint on a brush. The paint work
would make a purist cry. It looks funky(but not that bad) but if a rock hits
it or something else comes along like a moronic door swinger, it's like, oh
darn, where's that can  of Tremclad?  The body is original and nearly
perfect, and at any show of rust I have an arsenal of angle grinder, Dremel
tool etc ready to do my 5 minute body work. No rust is allowed to exist for
any time at all.
