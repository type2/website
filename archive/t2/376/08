Subject: Re: [T2] Sloppy Shifter???

There is a reverse lockout plate that fits under the shifter. A manual will
show you how to install it and what it looks like. You may be missing it.
Not too hard to find at any junkyard or VW retailer.
Sloppy shifting can be other things too, which you can repair.
New shift coupler at the front of the trans.
New shift rod bushings, especially the front one near the shifter.
Worn out hockey stick and bushings in the trans nose cone. (I just got a
late model 091 nosecone and hardened hockey stick from Transform in Long
Beach, which will clean up the sloppy shifting, whenever I get around to
dropping the trans and installing it)

BTW, letting girlfriends or others drive VW buses has been known to lead to
engines being run out of oil, overheated and driven faster than they can
take. I've heard too many stories of, it had a tick in the engine when I got
it back.  Beware, check your oil!
BTW, what year is your bus?
