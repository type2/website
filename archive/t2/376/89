Subject: RE: Paint Jobs

What's the point of all the negativity around cheap paint jobs?

Last I checked, the primary purpose of paint was to prevent metal from
rusting.  Anything that achieves that end doesn't deserve to be shot
down just because it's inexpensive or (god forbid) not as attractive as
a professional job.

A couple months ago, some friends and I completely repainted my Bus with
a brushed-on urethane gloss industrial coating, about $100 worth of the
stuff.  One of said friends is an artist, and the Bus is now wrapped on
all sides with scenes of mountains, dragons, the Northern Lights,
forests, streams... maybe some VW purists hate the idea of art cars,
still horrified by images of vans plastered in flowers and peace signs?
I really don't care.  I get more friendly waves and "Nice Bus!" comments
from strangers than I'd ever get with a $2,000 like-it-looked-in-1971
paint job.  Besides, all in perspective: this is a vehicle that I bought
for $500 last year, one step away from the junkyard.  It will never look
brand-new again on the outside, but it does have a brand-new engine, a
new carburetor, new battery, new fuel lines, new muffler, new
generator.. this weekend, it gets new heater boxes, retractable seat
belts, new gauges, and maybe a new bench seat.

Just think: I could have spent all that money on a paint job.. but isn't
saving a perfectly good vehicle from certain death good enough?
