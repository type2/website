Money is a big issue here Mike--no doubt--

But here is a bigger issue--

I have read guys spending hours / days / months on repairing, prepping a
vehicle--and spending the bucks on this part of the paint job--and then
spray canning the vehicle--or better yet rolling and brushing them.

What a waste of time and energy.
Why even bother--
And this was a good job in their mind.

Again--it's all a sense of values--and people have a bunch of
them--that's for sure.
If you have to keep things patched up--thats fine--this is the way it
has to be because of the bucks involved--but the vehicle can be at least
clean--as I'm sure your's is.

An unslick paint job doesn't mean the Bus is a toilet--

Ever get an exact definition of "Mint"--??

Go looking to by a vehicle.
One mans mint and mine are two different things-

If putting food on the table is an important issue-- maybe VW's shoudn't
be part of your life right now--they are like paying rent or feeding the
family--they require the bucks on a regular basis--no way around
it--it's an understood thing.

It's all in what's more important in your life at the time. Food and
shelter for your family, or a $3000.00 to $5000.00 paint job for the
bus. I'm not ashamed of my current financial condition, and I figure
that stopping or at least slowing down the rust is preferable to waiting
until I can afford a $3000.00+ repaint, window seal refurbishing, and
etc. job. 
At present, even $3000.00 is more than I can pay myself for two months
work with getting my business through it's first year. A case of rattle
cans runs about $11.43, and I figure about 4 cases to get the job
looking decent. So $42.72 for the paint, maybe $20.00 for the wire brush
doodads for the drill and for the Dremel, and a lot of free labor. Less
than $65.00 total (not including sodas and burgers to keep my son
interested in helping Dad with the job). 
Will my bus then be a filthy, "obviously" unloved "rat"? I think not.
