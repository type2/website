Tough to get enough paint on a bus with a rattle can, tough to get get 
enouhg paint on there fast enough to cover uniformly, etc. etc.

I did a cheapie paint job several years ago on my bus for about $300 in 
materials and $700 in labor. I paint an acquaintance for the body work as I 
did not have the tools and place to work.

Dumb! He did a fair job but not much better than I could have and I could 
have spent the $700 on a used air compressor and cheapie gun suitable for 
primer. Labor is expensive. Do it yourself.

Paint. I use acrylic enamel + hardner. Very basic paint, basic quality, 
basic price. I was a newby and did not want to "risk" alot of expensive 
paint with my dubious abilities. Next time on the next car (or this one) 
I'll try something better (better equipment, better paint).

Today looks fine, holds out the rust. Not comparable to a new car finish 
and not comparable to the OEM paint. Not as good. Better than it's previous 
self though.

If you've got a reasonable budget do it right the first time even if you've 
got to eat beans for a while. We had no real budget so we halfway did it 
last time. Next though it should be as simple and sanding and blocking and 
painting - no collision damage, no rust damage to repair.
