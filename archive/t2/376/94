What I see here is:
1)  There is a spectrum for owners ranging from the just keeping it 
running don't care how it looks to the only drive it on sunny days, in 
the morning.
2)  Owners who would rather work extra to pay for the repair/paint/body 
work (if they are unable to do it) and the owned who view their own time 
working on the bus as a hobby/recreation and therefore "free".

The answer to the original question, how much to paint a bus, is 
anywhere from $100 to $5000.  It all depends on what you want.

I fall into the "like it clean" crowd, but with two kids, 5 and 4, and 
going to the beach with toys as the major family activity I have learned 
to accept the sand and finger prints.  I do still wash and wipe down the 
bus every Sunday evening - but what happens the next day happens.
