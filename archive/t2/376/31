I used a Sherwin Williams product in a high end Duplicolor sold as Custom
Color one step auto finish....about $7-8 a 11oz can, a can would cover
maybe 2sq ft and at two coats plus primer I used 4+ cases of the
stuff.  rattle can but deffinately not a cheap paint job,  has lasted
better than 10 years though...one advantage of this kind of paint job,
couple years ago my bus got graffitied on the drivers side,  I had the
paint sanded, primed and repainted inside the day, never had to drive it
with the "X" rated comments on the side....

my bus was painted this way for reasons other than $$$ or equipment since
I have all the spray guns etc, and I don't think the paint itself would
have cost much more than I spent on rattle cans, and it probably took
longer...I just could not take the van off the road for any time during
this period, so it was a "Paint and drive" operation
