Subject: head redux and Portland Oregon junkyard questions...

Synopsis: Bought car, broke valve spring keeper, unable to put new valve
keeper on car.)

I took the car back to the PO (mechanic) and he said put a good used head
on it for $75. Picked it up last night and it seems ok (I'm going to do a
more thorough examination in the daylight). So, although I have some
lingering suspicions as to the long term viability of the engine. I have
resolved to take good care of it and drive carefully until I have the time
and $  to look into a new motor. I am really happy that the seller took
responsibility. 

My next question is, are there any junkyards in Portland that have Busses
in them that are not picked clean? (stop laughing....)If not, where around
here would you go? I lost a headlight rim (must not have screwed it in well
enough). and I'm not up for financing Ashley at always Vee-Dub. It sucks
cause I know that hes got one, and I know what he will charge me for it.
(I, not saying Ashley shouldn't make a profit, I just cant afford to give
it to him at the moment)

I also need to rehab the camper (AIS) interior. apparently the entire RV
wiring system is gone, along with the water tank. The fridge, and an
electric heater (?) are all there, but all the wires are gone. Along with
the H2O tank for the sink. I don't even know where to start on that...
