I've heard that a much better final paint job can be gotten by doing this,

although it is very labor intensive.. But it is the kind of a thing that a

dedicated owner could do themselves. I guess it takes out all the

irregularities and blotches and gives a lovely, uniform sheen. >>

"Wet sanding"...Paint the bus/car, then wet sand (a waterproof paper
with progresively finer grit is used). The paper is kept wet inder a fine 
mist to wash away the sanded paint. Dry the vehicle and paint it again.
Keep repeating with finer and finer grits...It's the way cars were done
in the twenties and thirties...Coachbuilt cars, at least...
