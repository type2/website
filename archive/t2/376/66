BlankHi all,
I have a dash clock from a '74 bus with the thermo fuse wire blown.
Any suggestions on how to fix it and what to fix it with? Not sure what
caused the fuse to blow in the first place though as I bought the clock as
it is.
Alternatively I have a good new VDO clock, how hard is it to swap the
mechanisms?
