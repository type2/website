Hey, waitaminute...When the Bus was built, it wasn't any more than a
Ford or Chevy van...Different but no more. If time and the vagaries
of fortune have made it collectable, then so. But it's still an owner-
servicable vehicle built to be used...Work van, camper, or Trailer
Queen; your choice...It was "cheap, dependable wheels", once, if the
owner chooses to keep it as such, then it's his/her choice...Drive it
till it's used up...
