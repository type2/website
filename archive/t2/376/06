Subject: Sloppy Shifter???

Hey guys,

	After driving the Bus around a bit this weekend, I was trying to get
used to the shifter but I kept either going into fourth gear, or reverse
when I wanted to get into second. Isn't there supposed to be some sort of
device that prevents you from accidentally shifting into reverse? I would
get that horrible grinding noise. On Sunday, I managed to get a feel for the
shifter enough that I could make it to second without any problems. I wonder
if maybe my shifter is rather sloppy and if I can fix it. My girlfriend was
driving it this weekend after I got it running, and she had to wear her
platforms to reach the pedals. I'd like if possible, to know if there is any
kind of a shifter plate or something that makes it so that you know exactly
where to put the stick shift into gear.

Any ideas?
