Subject: vdo oil pressure gauge/sender

If I am going to install one of these, I guess I should do it now while I 
have the engine on the stand....that way I can modify the tin to fit well
as some have suggested, without using an  extension.

Can someone verify for me that this sender is the type that the
resistance changes with oil pressure change?...not like the CHT stuff
that requires special extension wire?

Cheers and thanks, dave
