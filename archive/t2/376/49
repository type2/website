Subject: Fi components / list (missing something?)

Hi guys, i just bought the following (95% complete) FI to convert my bus 
(carbs/FI).
Below is a list of what i bought.

2 questions:
-Do you see anything missing to do the conversion?
-The PVC valve/breather is missing, any of you guys have one for sell?
Thanks, Ben

Injection components

-Air intake box with mass air sensor (AFM)
-"S" shaped tube from there to the throttle and air distribution box
-The throttle and air distribution box
-The rubber couplings to the air intakes (leading to the heads)
-The air intakes
-Fuel injectors (six..a couple of spares)I have a couple of the small 
"O" rings, but I get more(I'd wait until you can inspect the quality of 
what I have)
-Temp sensor that goes on the left head
-Cold start valve
-Cold start valve cut off sensor
-Idle control valve
-Complete harness
-There's a small vacuum retard that mounts on the firewall and the bracket
-Double relay
-F/I resistors
-Most (if not all) the formed hoses you will need
-Fuel ring lines that feed the injectors
-Long fuel lines that go across the top of the engine
-Pressure regulator
-Fuel pump
- PVC valve box (I DO NOT HAVE!)

One thing I know I DO NOT have is the PVC valve box that sits on top of 
the "square hole" on the top of the engine block. It feeds between the 
"S" hose and the engine crankcase.
