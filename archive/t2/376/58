Subject: Oil Leaks

Hi,

I just changed the oil in "La Vebe" this weekend and I found some leaks 
that I wasn't aware of.
I took some pictures and posted them at 
http://photos.yahoo.com/bc/palomera_arias/lst?.view=t&.dir=/Vebe+Leaks.
I'm wondering how severe they might be and how urgent their fixture should be.

Thanks a lot,

Rogelio
