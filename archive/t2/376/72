Subject: Paint, Wax, And Such

Terry K has a point: it's all about tastes and priorities which, as we all
know, vary widely within any group, even one such as ours with a common
interest.

That being said, I have to admit to being a rattle-can kind of guy. Partly
due to issues of cost, partly for the 'George' factor (I can't take the bus
off the road for any length of time), and partly because I have always
valued function over appearance. You should see the machine I built  at
work...ugly as sin but still running production after 15 years.

My bus is in pretty fair shape, paint wise. Way better than some I've seen
on the road, not as good as others. But she's my daily driver, my road trip
partner, and my all-around workhorse. Is she a rat? A pig pen? A trash
truck? I don't care; she's mine and we get along just fine.

With all due respect to Terry K, he sounds a lot like my boss, who spends
more on tires and detailing in a year than he pays some of his employees.
(That's only a SLIGHT exaggeration. Don't get me started.) No smoking,
eating drinking, or people who look like they might be sweaty or dirty
allowed.  But, it's his money, his time, and his priority.....whatever gets
him through the day.      I already apologise to you, Terry. No offense
intended. I can admire your bus, I just can't emulate it.

Regards,
Dave
