Subject: re H4 headlamp conversion

I installed my Bosch H4 headlamps this wknd, and I can only say I am in awe at
the quality! The lamps were made in Sweden, the bulbs in Germany. The quality
and fit were awesome. The lenses didn't say Motorcycle on the bottom BTW, as
I've heard others comment. Too bad I stripped one of the holes on the mounting
ring, #$%*&.
