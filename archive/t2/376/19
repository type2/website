I think you're going to have to mess with the throttle plate gap.  Without a central idling system, that is the only way you have to get air into the engine.  I would start by turning both throttle stop screws all the way out so that the throttles are completely closed.  Then turn each screw until it *just* touches the stop, plus an additional two turns.  Then start the bus and see if it will idle.  If not, turn each screw in another half turn and start it again.  Repeat until it idles.  :-)
