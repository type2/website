Subject: Re: [T2] paint jobs

A whole roomful of DIY mechanics here, 
and nobody wants a decent paint job ?!!!
Technical explanations of mechanical minutae
ad infinitum abound here, but mention paint 
and it's immediately brought to conclusion that
the cheapest, fastest, and least durable 
techniques and materials are most popular,
followed by GEX-type paint repair services,
and down at the bottom of the list is the guy
who suggests that a proper paint job is the best
way to maintain the single most valuable 
mechanical feature of your bus- the exterior.

If the Idiot book had included paint as an
important consideration of future value, there
would now be a whole generation of rust-free vw's.
Future owners will have a lot of work.
Let's drop the "Let it rot, it's my bus" lingo.
There's a lot to learn here.
