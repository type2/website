Subject: re Running the bus out of oil...

Sorry for any offense! You obviously know your way around a bus and a
wrench, and I'm sure lots of guys would like to have a wife/girlfriend like
that! No sooner did I post this message than I thought, hope I didn't offend
anyone. And, he answered me that his girlfriend's car was low on oil and she
hadn't changed it in like a year when he met her, so I don't think I was
really outrageously off. Just a heads up for our sensitive vehicles. My bus
is co-owned by myself and my wife, she's part of it too.

Hey now!

Bite your tongue and watch what you say!!

Some of us girlfriends have successfully pulled, rebuilt and reinstalled
running engines.

I know I have.
