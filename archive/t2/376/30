Does anyone out there know anything about "water sanding"?
I've heard that a much better final paint job can be gotten by doing this,
although it is very labor intensive.. But it is the kind of a thing that a
dedicated owner could do themselves. I guess it takes out all the
irregularities and blotches and gives a lovely, uniform sheen.
