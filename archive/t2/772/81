This is a beautiful trip although at night there is not much to see. Once you leave Grant's Pass it is extremely dark along that route until you emerge at Crescent City.

The first time I drove it was at night and I had the original sealed beam headlights and didn't fare too well.

The 2nd time I drove with Bosch H4's and the difference was substantial.
