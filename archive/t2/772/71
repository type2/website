One can trace VW history thru' the 60's but choose
not to go all the way back to it's pre-WW II origins

Henry was no slouch in the hatred department...
He may have put America on wheels, but he tried
very hard to have a say in who was American...
Google up Ford and The Protocols of the Elders of
Zion for an example...
