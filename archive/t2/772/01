Subject: The Hoover Sermons and Aircooled parts availability on Hawaii

Hello Y'all, Greg Potts wrote "the Hoover sermons are there" and posted
a link which leads to a archive of Bob's sermons, but none of the links
go anywhere. Is this Info NLA or is there some glitch between my Webtv
and the files? Also, I don't know how many listees live on the Big
Island, but since the recent demise of Aloha Otto in Hilo, due to the
owners health problems, the supply of aircooled parts on the island has
virtually dried up. I have decided to stock most of the parts and
supplies for the mid '60's to early '80's Type 2, and some Bug and Thing
stuff as well. I also have an inventory of  NOS and used Type 2 parts.
Call me with your needs: 808-887-2027 or email me at rcaviator AT webtv
DOT net . Delivery and roadside assistance are available. Thanks, Timo
