Anybody have the idle tube and elbows for the stock dual solex carbs?
My mickey mouse setup finally gave up on me while messing with the
stripped stud. I was using brake booster elbows and a length of fuel
line to make it happen. But the booster elbows are too small and
disintegrated.

I'd just have gotten one from Busted Bus but they never answer my
emails for some reason. :-(
