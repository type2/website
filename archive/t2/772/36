Subject: Re: [T2] Power Brake Conversion

From Jon Stiles:

I am doing a power disc brake conversion on my 68 DC. Where do I hook up the positive vacuum pressure line 
from the engine that routs to the booster assembly?

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

I am sure you mean the vacuum UNDERpressure line?

It needs to connect to your intake manifold. What heads, carb(s), and intake are you running?

If it is a DP with a 34 pic carb, you will need a 71 bus, or a bug that has auto stick, center section intake 
manifold with the large vacuum nipple in the base below the carb flange.  #19 here:
