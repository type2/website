Subject: Re: [T2] sliding door woes

My previous suggestions were of no value
in solving your problem. I had pictured
the rear lock mechanism incorrectly.
I took a look at a door today, and did
discover the door can be removed if in
fact the mechanism is kaput.

A "ball" allen wrench will remove the rear catch.
This would have allowed the door to open.
Then the rear latch hardware could be removed.

The front catch is easily accessed from inside
with a wrench. This would resolve an issue
with the front latch hardware.
