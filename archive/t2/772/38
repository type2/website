actually the question should be "why do you want to??"

there is no significant advantage to a five speed in a bus.   and the 094
gearbox is not as tough as the bus 4 speed.  remember this is a 4000lb
truck we're talking about. the Type 4 engine is not a racing engine
(unless it is a 914 version) it is a torquey (is that a word) low speed
hauler...  unless you plan to race your bus. I would still ask "Why?"
