Yeah, that's what I have on there now.  It's
still too long though.  If I put even a single
shim, it won't tighten down at all.  The Gates
touted by the folks at the local buggy shop
Chirco as they best for all 12V vw's.  I have not
measured the Conti belt or the Gates.  I'll do
that later tonight.

I guess I'm not following you.  I allow it to
turn a little.  Then tighten it down a smidge
(with a screwdriver wedged behind the back pulley
to keep it from moving), then turn it once or
twice, then repeat.

Pulley is 6.5 inches in diameter and appears
stock.  Is that a power pulley?  

Clamp on the alternator stand appears fine.  It
is tighten and in the right place.  

My alternator now seems to REALLY be making
noise.  I think it is already shot.  



Happy bussin'
