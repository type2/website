I have heard of newer cars, when you reverse with the e-brake on it actually
tightens the e-brake. I don't believe the buses ever came with this
option....
 I am assuming the bus is in Neutral when drifting backwards down the
incline?
 This could be a simlar problem as I had with mine, if the wheel cylinders
arent attached or secured to the backing plate, the wheel cylinders could be
moving. Or maybe your little springs that hold the shoes to the backing
plate could be missing, allowing the shoes to move back and forth thus
creating the drag....
 Or maybe I need to go get some coffee...brain hurts ACK! Gosh I didnt think
I would need much recovery for my 21st b-day (yesterday)!!!
