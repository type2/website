Subject: A "feel-good" Bay sighting

I was going up highway 285 yesterday to drop off some trannys to famous
"Steve the Transmission Guy" in Pine, CO. I talked my wife into going with
me and we were chatting about how 1 mph of headwind slows us down by 5mph.:)

We came crawling up one of the many hills and low and behold a beautiful
pre-72 beige and white westy weekender! He and his passenger gave me a peace
sign (I just wave) as I literally FLEW past him. It really helped my wife
understand we drive the "hotrod" of early bays. And that is with a 1600 sp,
two adults, two huskies and three trannys in back! Wheeeee!

Can't wait to get my FI 1914 motor installed!

"Always remember where you came from, cause going down is a lot more fun"

Oh and it was great to see someone else braving the +90 degree heat for some
good times.
