Subject: Re: [T2] Rear wheel camber

Wayne,

Plain and simple....

Either the rear wheel bearings, or bushings are tired and need replacing.

If that doesn't fix it, then it is probably torsion bar adjustment time.

With IRS rear end, it is probably not due to the torsion bars, so look at 
the bushings holding the arm to the frame(or tube).

Cheers, dave

 My '79 bus has some negative (bottom farther out than top) camber on the

 written an article on this?
