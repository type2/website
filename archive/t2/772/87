absolutely was up near there (with a rental car) if I had not had my high
beams on I probably wouldn't have seen the deer in time, just stood in the
middle of the road, never moved either, as I slowly drove past it, the
deer watched me otherwise I might have thought it a stuffed animal,
considering it's size it would have made a mess.

  many years ago I clipped a deer at night in Colorado while in my 65
westy.  had a huge dent over the passenger side headlight where a hoof
caught the bus as it jumped out of the way.... still scares me to think
about..

 be careful those deer will make a mellavahess out of the front of a bus,
and likely the person in the front too.
