Subject: Re: [T2] solenoid trouble

I measured the voltage the stock wire was delivering to the starter motor- 
it was 6 volts. I was getting 12 at the ignition switch. I cut the stock 
wire out and ran a brand new 12 gauge red wire from front to back, soldering 
all connections.. New crimp on terminal on to the starter motor and vroom! 
Starter works like Jack the Bear, with the key for a change.
For those having starter problems, I'd have a careful look at this before 
installing a hot start relay.  Old, corroded wires aren't going to work very 
well. This is with a newly rebuilt starter motor too.

The stock wire was 4.0mm2 which is roughly 11AWG so I'd say go up one size 
to 10AWG.

The wire from the switch according to the wiring diagram is 2.5mm2 and goes 
into a tee. Have you tested that connection?

Have you tried to measure the resitance of that wire by extending the lead 
on your ohmeter?
