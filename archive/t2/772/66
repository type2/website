Dave (and all),

I'm that guy.

I am just finishing putting together my redline/Weber IDF style MPI Fuel
Injection kit on my 1914 engine. I had the motor specially made from MOFOCO
to match the system. I haven't fired it up since my 68 DC is still in paint.

Right now I am trying to work out some issues with the brake booster vacuum
attachment and finding the right tin for my 71 Doghouse conversion.

The EFI kit seems like a very complete system and extremely simple as
Multi-port Fuel Injection goes. I did a complete upgrade and install of a
MPFI kit from HESCO (sold under Mopar Performance) on my 89 Jeep wrangler
with a 4.2L motor. The change from the old Carter Carb was like night and
supernova. I gained 80 hp and 150 ft/lbs of torque, not to mention a jump of
10mpg!!! No kidding!

The Jeep conversion took me a week, the Redline/Weber will take me a couple
afternoons. Their directions are very specific and they include a nice
CD-ROM instructional utility.

I'll post some photos of the kit. The price was $2214 with a MSD electronic
ignition and computer. I think a feller could get it cheaper if you mixed
and matched parts from CB Performance and Redline/Weber, used a Megasquirt
programmable computer and used a different dizzy setup.

I think the cost is certainly worth it, since there are fewer moving parts,
better power, better cooling (since your fuel/air ratio is constant and your
timing is computer controlled), and most importantly MUCH LOWER EMISSIONS.
It has always been hard for me to know that I am driving a polluter. Any
carb equipped vehicle pollutes, period.

My emissions went from multiple fails at the SMOG station, down to "LEV" or
low emissions vehicle on my Jeep after the conversion.

Anyhow I'll keep you and the list informed how the progress goes and
especially how the EFI goes. I am curious to see how it programs, how it
adjusts for Colorado's extreme altitude changes and how it adapts to
Colorado's extreme barometric pressure changes.

Jon
