All international busses, non US, had the good
old 1600 DP all the way through '79.

I wouldn't say ALL international busses, but it
was certainly the standard endinge.  Also, 1600s
didn't die in 79.  The non-US spec Transporters
("vanagons" to we Mericuns and Canucks) had 1600s
until the end of the European aircooled
Transporters, 1983.  I don't believe any other
aircooled T2 transporter (Mexican or Brezilian)
had anything except the 1600.  There were never
any pancake engine busses down there. 

 



Happy bussin'
