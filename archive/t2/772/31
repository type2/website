Did you replace the original holder?

How hot do the wires get? The smaller ones closest to the fan.

I've never noticed that.

As the fan gets older is will draw excess amounts of current until it seizes
completely. It normally draws 6-7A at idle, hence the double rated fuse.

Junkyard is the best bet for replacement as the NOS fans seem to have dried
up (cip1 was the last source I knew of a couple of years ago).

When you rotate the squirrel cage by hand, you should feel some resistance
but it's not rubbing, it's the magnets inside. Any kind of noise is
unwanted.
