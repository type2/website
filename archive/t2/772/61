Subject: paint code

Hi,

I'm new in this mailing list and need your help about a paint code.
I have a westy (1979) which is going to be repaint. As the decision of
the color is very important I would like to be sure that the result
will be the one expected.

I will certainly choose the tuquoise color (L380) and the atlas white
on top if you confirm me that the color of the split on the
picture www.anyvintage.com/ images/Ebaystuff/67bus1.JPG ,
 is the turquoise L380 :

Thanks in advance for your help
best regards.

Greg
