Beautiful drive along 199 during the daytime, did that route over Memorial Day weekend.  I'm sure it's quite dark at night, so have good headlights and watch for deer .. constantly watch for deer.  While my driving-at-night-in-the-mountains experiences are all from NorCal (Trinity County), I'm sure that's sound advice anywhere.  Deer + car = big mess and possibly ruined vacation.
