Yes, the whole thing was disconnected and all the wires cut as it was
from a hot part of Australia hence I have replaced it with a spade
fuse connector. I would have wanted an original but the UK is dry for
parts.

I checked them before, not hot just warm, the one with the fuse is not
bad at all.

If you get the chance to touch it after its been running for a few
minutes I would appreciate it.....

This is I think the sign of a dying fan......hence me going from 10A
to 13A to 20A.....Umm I could ofcourse test the amps being drawn
usiing a multimeter.....I'll do that now.

Bugger......lets hope the sustained current is 6-7A

Its not that noisey but its not that quiet.....its a little stiff.....

Thanks for the info....
