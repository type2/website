Subject: Electrical Woes. . .

I just got a '76 camper with 1800 type 4.  I've driven it about 3
times and I went to start it today and just got a "click".  I figured
the battery is dead (it's an old die hard) and I had a new battery
sitting around so I went to stick it in and hooked up the postive
terminal, no problem. I stick the negative on and all of a sudden
smoke from the alternator I believe. Now, I'm not sure, but I don't
think I switched poles, but it's possible. This camper and lots of
extra electrical stuff (an isolater I believe, to have a 2nd battery
and stuff).

Anyway, before I burn everything else up. What should I check?  Is
there someway to check an alternator without the engine on, and how do
you test is with the engine running (or will it even run). This
couldn't have happened at a worse time, my usual mechanic I take vw's
to when they are beyond me is out of town this week and I was going to
go camping this weekend!  Anyway, anyone have any suggestions? I don't
really want to try anything else and burn more stuff up.
