Subject: Re: [T2] Is the end near? Few VW buses seen at premier hippie

I've got a nephew operating just like that. He thinks we're cool b/c we've got a VW Cabrio daily driver, a VW Westy and Beetle. he thinks it is all about the hippy "accesories" - that is the wardrobe and the music. Knows little or nothing of the history behind the hippy thing. We're no hippies at my house. I might share a few ideas with them but with all the positive ideas/styles there are alot of negative ones as well. I choose not to operate along those negative ones. 

All in all we have fun breaking the stereotypes. Our politics don't fit, our clothes aren't "right", wrong music, nice house in the suburbs, no illegal habits, etc.<grin!> 

We like to think of ourselves as laid back folks who just happen to drive VW's. Not hippy VWs but instead just vintage European - or something.
