Subject: sliding door woes 

Hi All

I have a little big problem.
I have a 74 westie. The sliding door won't open now.
The problem is the cable going to the lock near the rear hinge
is broken. It is broken inside the lock itself (not outside the lock).
Is there a way to jimmie the lock to release to open the door?
I have stuck a screwdriver in there..etc.
Bently shows how to dismantle while the door is open, not closed.
Nothing in type 2 articles. Searching the archives isn't helping at the 
moment.
Anyone have ideas? Dealt with the same problem?

It's a small wire cable, not the other types of hookups.
Please help :)
James
