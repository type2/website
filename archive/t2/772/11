It's done.

I liked the idea of using the steel wool. But there is still enough
thread left in the head that the steel wool wouldn't allow the stud to
thread in. (I tried before putting the JB in there.)

However the stud would thread in with a couple strips of foil. So I
cleaned out the hole with a wood dowel, wire brushed the stud, smeared
JB in the hole with a Q-Tip, smeared a thin layer on the stud, put 2
narrow strips of foil (wrapped around the bottom of the stud, like a
"U" shape so it would stay on) and put it in.

It cranked down tight as a fresh new head. :)

It's setting now, and tomorrow eve I'll try putting the manifold back
on. I know ya'll said 48-72 hrs, but I need the bus Monday morn
unfortunately. But as nice and tight as that stud felt from the added
thickness of foil and JB I think it'll be fine. I hope so...

I found a pair of heads at a shop in Cali, rebuilt, for my 1700 for
$150. If they're still there in 2 paydays, I'll get them. Then I get
to do a head replacement! Fun! ;)
