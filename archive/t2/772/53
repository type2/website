As others have said your fan is on the way out. I have given mine (not 
nearly as bad as yours) another lease of life by spraying WD40 into the 
hole you will find underneath near the fan end. Do not tell anyone on the 
list about this method as they will go spare about WD40 not being a 
lubricant, etc! ;)

I'm sure I read at some stage a description of dismantling the fan motor 
housing and lubricating the bearings properly. It sounded like a job not 
for the faint of heart. However, you probably wouldn't have to do it again!

Cheers,

Martin.
