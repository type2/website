Subject: '72 bus owners manual wanted..

Hello.

Does anyone out there have a '72 bus owner's manual they are willing to 
sell??  I would like to pay $10 + media mail shipping.

I am selling my '72 Westy and I would like to present the new owner with an 
owner's manual.

If you are willing to trade, please tell me what you need / want.  Perhaps a 
cute outside front spare tire cover, or a suitable tire cover for the inside 
spare?? -You pay actual shipping, of course...

Private Mail, please...
