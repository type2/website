Dave,

Thanks.  I beginning to think that I may have help caused the problem.  A
buddy of mine and I did adjust the torsion bars (added 2 degrees) to raise
the rear a bit.  I'm not sure if when we put it back together, we got all
the bits lined up correctly and this may have caused or worsened the camber.

Wayne,

Plain and simple....

Either the rear wheel bearings, or bushings are tired and need replacing.

If that doesn't fix it, then it is probably torsion bar adjustment time.

With IRS rear end, it is probably not due to the torsion bars, so look at 
the bushings holding the arm to the frame(or tube).

Cheers, dave

 My '79 bus has some negative (bottom farther out than top) camber on the
