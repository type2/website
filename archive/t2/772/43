76 to 79 bay transaxles are 091's.
Where does this ad say the 091 came from a T25??

      "72 Bus w/091 transaxle, f.i., needs work - $1000
      72 VW microbus, custom interior with yin-yang, "steal your face" and musical note designs stitched in. 
NEEDS WORK. Barn door v. rusty. 2.0 '76 fuel-injected engine fully rebuilt, runs, in great shape, with custom 
Mitsubishi electronic distributor (no changing points!), just needs fluids drained and replaced as it has sat 
a while. Highly sought-after heavy-duty 091 transaxle, but transmission needs rebuild. Would be a great 
project for a handy tourhead, or good source of parts for another VW bus. Loved this van, hate to see it go, 
but Jerry's dead and I'm not touring anymore. $1000 obo, make offer. Must go! Email or call Chris
