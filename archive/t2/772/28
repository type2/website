Subject: Heater blower running hot

Deal All,

A simple question re my heater blower in my type 4 engine. I was
running a 10A fuse and that blew. I replaced with a 13A and that blew
and then a 15A and that blew. I noted a previous thread re blowing
fuses however it hasn't been archived yet?!? I have a spade type fuse
holder and my local parts shop does not have the required 16A fuse (I
finally looked it up in Bentley). I thus did what should not be done
but put a 20A fuse in. All seems to run OK but the fan does get hot,
not too hot to touch but hot none the less.

I will get a 16A fuse however my quetion to some owners is; could
anybody give me an indication if their fan runs hot?

Also why is this fan so big and draws such high current? Is their a
modern alternative which draws less juice?

Charles
