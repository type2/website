Subject: "chirping" after tightening alternator belt.

While tuning up the daughter's 75 bus (the plugs looked great at 15,000 
mi) I thought the alternator belt was loose so tightened it to 1/2" of 
play.  Chirping/rubbing?  noise at idle, not obvious at running speed. 
Backed it down a bit, does not chirp, may be a tad loose.  So is this a 
sign of an impending alternator bearing problem, or was it just rubbing 
somewhere due to the increased tension?  I switched the regulator 
thinking it was a bit low (13.5v) but the other (which does better in 
the camper) did about the same.
