  I don't know if you do your own work or not, some times those little
washers, springs and pins are not installed properly and they will come
loose and either float around inside the brake area, fall out or start to
cause some major issues. My 73 Westy was missing both sets on one side of
the bus, I am not sure if this was due to stupidity by not putting them in,
or just not installing them correctly.

 T1 Fats performance case with the piston oilers - I flycut the heads
(30.5x 40mm valves) for the
90.5 P&C's, ported the exhaust (intake was already done), and did all the
valve geometry, cut each pushrod for 0 valve clearance, Porsche
Bigfoot/elephant rocker adjusters, full flow with gene burg ff oil pump,
external filter, and 2 48-pass mesa oil coolers mounted in the luggage area
of the riviera top :) with about 110 hp. With of course a little help from
my vw engine guru - Hitman aka Rich.
