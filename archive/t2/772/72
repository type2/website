Subject: FI heads with carbs

I've been trying to solve a fuel mixture issue with my
bus (1700 type 4 engine, all-stock carb-distibutor
setup), and my mechanic discovered that there seems to
be FI heads installed in the engine.

Does anyone know if this would create some sort of
issue? He didn't seem to think so. What's the
differnce?
