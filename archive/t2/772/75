Subject: Portland to San Fran. Trip

Just wanted to drop a line to announce our long anticipated road trip from 
Portland to San Francisco.   So, heads up to all of you on the AIRS List in 
case the bus needs some love on the trip..and we need to contact any of 
you.

We will be leaving this Wed. (7/27) evening and are due to be in San 
Francisco by Sat. evening to see a Rusted Root Concert.  We will be taking 5 
South thru Oregon and then the 199 to 101 in California.

After the concert in San Fran, we will be heading north on the 1 towards the 
Lost Coast and Kings Range as well as the Redwoods.

Also, looks like the campgrounds are packed up for this Sat. all around San 
Francisco, so if anyone who lives there knows of a good place we can park 
the bus and sleep for the nite, drop us a line-or even a rest area on the 1 
heading north out of San Fran. That would be helpful.
