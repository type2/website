Subject: T2 Bay

Hi,

I am trying to fin d a solution to restore my Bus in a
"fake" camper, as some around, and searching in TYPE2
list i encounter you. you have a "REAL" german bay,
lucky you. I have Portuguese CKD one. rusty but
reliable. I started to repar the shet metal and i'll
go as deep as it needs.
I wanna have it in a very good shape, to go trought
deep in europe, maybe visit you father born place. 

I'm restoring it and I found a lot of troubles I
bought it without any engine. I had to find one.
luckely a friend had a Type fot CU 2.0 lt more, and
sold it to me. a bargain. now i'm trying to change the
4 spd to a five 094 speedbox T25 engine. Everybody
tell me I'm nuts. Am I wrong? I found a lot of good
gentle people says no way. Why?

please aid me to find an answer. 

have you out there a drawing from a T2 and a T3 bottom
to check out if it fits?

thanks

Luis from Portugal, aplace in Europe, yet.
