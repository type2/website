Subject: RE: [T2] Rear wheel camber

Wayne,

Changing the torsion bars to *raise* the rear end would not have(by 
itself) caused the problem and theoretically should have made any negative 
camber problem a "little" better....this is usually on swingaxle, although 
I have worked on bugs with IRS for this problem also.

I never was happy with the result even after changing to polyurethane 
control arm bushings.

Yes, sounds like something didn't get lined up correctly on the reinstall
or the bushings on the "control arm" just aren't too strong anymore.

I'm sure Bentley talks about how to rectify this.

I'm having trouble visualizing how it is set up on a bus even though my 
back is killing me from doing the torsion bars on a singaxle "bug" this 
weekend ...not once, but twice.....and need to go back and do it again as 
I am 2 "fine" adjustments off on one side and 3 on the other...<very big sigh>

Cheers, dave

 Thanks.  I beginning to think that I may have help caused the problem.  A
 buddy of mine and I did adjust the torsion bars (added 2 degrees) to raise
 the rear a bit.  I'm not sure if when we put it back together, we got all
