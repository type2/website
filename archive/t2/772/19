"When I will need to replace the bottom end of my 2.0 liter"
I had to rebuild the 2 liter in our old 77 at 132,000 because the rivets
that hold the gear onto the camshaft sheared.

"I will probably just buy a `Cadillac` Boston Bob rebuild"
You won't be sorry.  I have one of his 1600 in our '71 and not only is the
engine great but so is his service.  After a routine valve adjustment I
couldn't get the driver's side cover to stop leaking so I called Bob for
advice.  Not only did I get his advice but he sent me a new cover, bale, and
gasket for free.
