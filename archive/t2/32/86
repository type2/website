Subject: AA Automotive Products Big Bore Piston/Cylinder Kit

To the list;

Does anyone on the list have any negative or positive  
comments about the 103mm and 104mm 
piston/cylinder kits produced by AA Automotive 
Products in San Francisco?

I contacted Bernie Bergmann yesterday about 
acquiring a set of big bore pistons/cylinders and he 
has nothing but good things to say about these kits.  

Just looking for other comments or opinions from 
those who may have some 'first-hand knowledge'  by 
using these p/c's.  Trying to decide whether to go 
with JE or these from AA.

TIA,
