No, you can't spin the engine backwards,even down a
hill!
Heard a story from Pim Van Loon about an old tractor
in Holland that a farmer accidentally push started in
reverse...pushing it forward.
The engine started & ran backwards,very roughly but
ran nonetheless.
Any how he noticed his mistake with the gears & put
the thing in 1st.....and backed straight through the
barn wall:-)
As far as boiling the battery & having the generator
not work then be able to stustain running, I had a
battery that I accidently ran flat by leaving the
headlights & foglamps on.
A road service mechanic jumpstarted me & I drove
60kms(about 40 miles)home & went inside for 2 minutes
& then the damn bus wouldn't start!!
Yet an hour later it was fine & started no problems.
:-)
Cheers
Andrew
