   Whoa- remember oil pressure is a measure of resistance given a
constant push!  The high pressure seen does not prove oil is getting to
the bearings faster- in fact it may flow more slowly as my gauge shows-
in cold weather, it takes longer to measure that 60 psi than when
starting in hot weather.  Given a constant pump source at a set rpm,, a
high pressure can result from either a dense oil to push (ie, cold) or
from very tight tolerances resisting the flow through of the oil as it
lubricates.  The latter will show when the oil is hot; the former shows
as it is cold out.  My "tired" 229,000 mi engine shows 60 psi also at
cold startup, but goes to 22 psi when the oil is over 240 degrees.
     I believe the modern engines have both a bypass valve that opens
when the pressure is too high (allowing oil cooler to be bypassed, and a
volume control valve that opens to dump excess oil to maintain a
constaint maximum high pressure.  Thus I suspect if your tolerances are
too tight, you could starve the bearings until the oil temp is higher. A
good reason to have a working thermostat in a new engine?
