Subject: Middle and Back seats for a =?iso-8859-1?q?Bus=3F?=

I recently purchased a 74 Bus with no middle or back seats. (imagine
that)  Anyway I know getting original VW seats will be hard to find
and cost alot.  I was wondering if anyone has used other bench seats
from other vehicles and got a good safe fit. I'm thinking the Ford
Aerostar seats might work with alittle modification.  Has anyone done
this.  Trying to find a VW Bus in a junk yard is impossible in my
area.  Thanks for any input.  If you would like to see my Bus after I
painted it you can go to

I shouldn't confess this but it was done with Rustoleum, rollers, and
sponge brushes.
