You can get a used gear that will probably crack soon also, or pay 
a rebuilder $80 to install a new one, or do what I did and get an 
identical gear made of metal (brass?) from the junkyard out of a 
BMW.  Unfortunately, I didn't write down the year and model of the 
car I got it out of, but it was an earlier model (late 70's, early 
80's) larger (5 or 6 series) car.  Take the old one with you to 
compare.  I have put a lot of miles on my bus since installing the 
metal gear and no problems have arisen.
