Three things to look for:

It might be that something is vibrating in resonance producing the sound.
Worst case would be a fan with a crack around the hub.  Doesn't touch at
low speeds but does touch when it spins and vibrates.  Make sure that all
fasteners are tight.

Does everything line up fine when you install it?  It might be that
tightening  the generatore strap is just enough to flex something into
contact.  All the holes should line up without having to force anything
into place.  It might be that the fan shroud is not seated correctly in
the cylinder tins, which is very easy to screw up.

Are your generator bearings OK?  Rock the top of the pulley in and out to
see if there is play in the shaft on either end.  This happened to me with
a brand new Bosch alternator.  It made a clunking sound at idle.  It made
me make pi**ed-off sounds as I was taking the thing out again!
