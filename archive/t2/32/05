Subject: Hanging a door 78 T2


Hello Volks,
I am replacing the doors on my 78 Westy but I am
having trouble adjusting the door properly. It is
always hanging too low on the latch side.  Can anyone
give me suggestions on the correct process of
adjustment.  Are the hinges on the door side fixed?  
Thanks,
Rick
