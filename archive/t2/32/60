Subject: Re: [T2] Relay power to coil?

I think that this would be a well worth while exercise. I have been thinking about this for a while, as my 74 bus has a hell of a lot of stuff hanging off the coil wire. IE: coil, fuel pump, carb choke heaters, idle cut off solenoid etc. The wire to the coil is only thin so the voltage drop must be quite considerable considering all the current being drawn. If I were to do it I would run a cable directly from the battery to the relay (possibly with some sort of fuse or fusible link in line), have the relay operated by the coil wire, then run this switched wire to a fuse block, giving each thing I run it's own appropriately rated fuse (i.e. one fuse for the carbs, one for the coil, one for the fuel pump and so on). I would like to hear others opinions on this, as I am definitely not a bus expert (just a pedantic electrician).
