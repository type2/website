the ones that would run with the engine off usually had a 15 minute timers
also they take a terrible drain on the battery, you probably couldn't keep
it running more than an hour or so without having a dead battery.

there probably was no "technical" reason why you couldn't run it all night
BUT I sure wouldn't....while the CO is vented outside it wouldn't take
much of a breeze the wrong way to fill the van with deadly gases.  the
other thing is that they probably would drive you out with the heat it
would get so hot in the van you would open the doors and windows.
