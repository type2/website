Subject: 1 Heater Box Needed

Hey Folks, I'm looking for a Passenger (Right Side) Heater Box for my 1973 VW 
Camper Bus (1700-1800 Engine).  Looking for an original German OEM Box that 
is in good condition (no rust or rot).  Part Number: 029 256 092 C

Can anyone be of assistance, or direct me as to where I can get one of these?
Thanks!
