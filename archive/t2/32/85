Well I guess I have the best of both worlds. One side
of my bus has a sliding window and the other has a
louvered window. It looks kinda strange but I liked
aspects of each. I put the sliding window on the
driver's side so people in the back could use the
drive through at fast food resturants as well as get a
good breaze while on the road. Strange reason butI
thought it was a neat idea. Have a great day!
