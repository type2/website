Hi Max
I've never seen the mount for the compressor, as both
the compressor and mount were missing when I bought my bus.
Like I mentioned I looked around for as much information as
I could find on the whole A/C setup but have never came
across a picture of the compressor/mount.  Anyone have a
picture of it? I'd be interested to see it also.
As for the over head unit, I got a lead from the buy & sell
at type2.com and I was going to use it for parts but it fell
through.  You might get lucky looking in a junk yard for
one, as I have not seen many people selling the units.
Used parts have to be out there as it wasn't just a
handful of people that had these installed on their buses.
It just seems that its not common for theses buses to
have A/C, in my experience.


sorry I cant be of much help
Alex,
