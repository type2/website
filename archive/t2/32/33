My Eber is a factory fitted unit(a BN4-the bus came from Sweden where they
appear to be fitted as standard)and has a clockwork timer which only allows
the unit to run for about 20 mins. when stationary.I think the current draw
would kill your battery overnight and the heat would probably roast you-they
are very efficient (hot)and mine has been no problem maintenence-wise with
the exception of a new plug(thanx Ron).-Martin '71(the best year-for a Bay
anyway) bus .
