Subject: re: help..oil leak (digest mode)

one other thing i forgot to add...

when we start up the bus (in cold weather) the oil
pressure rockets to 60psi. after the oil temp rises
the pressure levels off to 40psi (highway speeds.)

ahh, crap, did i blow some seals? we had only driven
the bus in virigina warm summer climate before hitting
the road out west. the temp dropped pretty low a few
days ago when the leak became worse and i noticed the
pressure increase upon start up.

thanks again for all of your help!
