well I have had both over more than 30years including a new 412 in 74 when
FI was fairly new to VW....I don't think I would ever have another carbed
bus.

I think the biggest problem with the Fuel Injection is the learning curve,
most folks don't want to take the time to learn to think differently.  But
the rewards of a properly operating fuel injected type 4 engine is worth
it.

 the fuel injected type IV engine IMO is the engine Ferdinand would have
built if he could have.
