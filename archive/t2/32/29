Mike, thanks for your reply.

I hear ya man, but unfortunately - in my bus - the
colors are switched.
Red is the ground, and the hot wire is black....  Like
someone else said,
valuable lesson here, always question the PO's work! 
I didn't....

Well, I already did it, that's why I posted in the
first place.  Not
sure what is fried and what isn't, just that my red
light is on.

Everything was hooked up properly before I posted, I
was just wondering
if anyone had any ideas on why the red light was on.

This is helpful, will do.  Thanks!

The car starts fine, it just runs w/ the red light on.

One listee replied in pmail w/ a way to repolarize the
generator, which
I'll try if the voltage doesn't check out.  He
suggested this:

"Polarizing the generator is easy. I believe you jump
the D+ to the DF on the
regulator momentarily only. Check with someone else
before you do it."

Can anyone verify this?

Peace, Milo

PS.  Thanks to everyone else for the replies as well!
