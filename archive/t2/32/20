If the generator is bad, the car will stop running as soon as you disconnect
the jumper cables, because there is no electircal current being produced.  I
question the comment about reversing the cables and it starting - this wil
lead to considerable sparking and potential explosion of the battery.

No, you cannot jump going backwards in first gear.  If you must go
backwards, put it in reverse.

Milo said : (on his '69 generator VW)  I hooked jumpers up to it from my car

and it started right up.  But as soon as I unhooked the jumpers, it died.

And then he said : and notice that the red cable in the back
of my bus is indeed, hooked up to the negative terminal, and that
when I jump started it, I had the + from the car hooked up the -
of the bus, and vise-versa....  Well, that explains why she wouldn't
stay running.

I ask : HOW DOES that explain why she would not stay running??? I don't 
understand. I thought that if you got the engine running, so what!!  The 
engine would turn the generator and provide current to the rest of the stuff

that makes the VW work, and the heck with the battery.  You probably don't 
even NEED a battery to run the '69 generator equiped VW.

Here's my own stupid question...  If I could start my '78 FI alternator 
stick Westy in first gear by coasting BACKWARDS down a grade, would it hurt 
anything?!?!? (it took me quite a while to come up with that ditty...)
