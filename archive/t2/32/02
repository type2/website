Subject: Parts to trade

Just pulled out the air conditioning coils from under my 75 bay window.
The hoses were all rotted and the fans on the large coil don't spin too
freely but a little oil might loosen them up. If you can use them in
your bus, please Email me direct. If you have anything to trade that I
could use on my bus, let me know. If you have no parts to trade, but can
still use the coils let me know. Maybe we can trade some bus stories and
you get the coils. I am located in Northern Arizona. Don't really want
to ship them so if you're passing through my area you can pick them up.
If not gone by end of month they go in the recycle bin.

Also have a 86 Ch*vy Sprint with damage to the front suspension. Not in
driveable condition. Engine ran perfect before the accident. New tires
all around. Most of the body in good condition.
Would like to trade for a Bay parts. But once again, if you have nothing
to trade don't worry! This car has got to go. Email direct if
interested.

Thanks and I hope these parts will brighten someone's day.
Tom
