Subject: Re: [T2] rabys aircooled / bug me videos. anyone order one of these?

We just received the videos today!! The events of the last month have
hampered the video production, just as everything else...

I have not received an e mail from you, if so I would have explained the
details. We have refrained from charging cards to this point, as we wanted
to have the videos ready to go prior to it.....They will be in the US mail
tomorrow, so be sure to watch the mail for them...

We are sorry for the delays, but we were waiting just like everyone
else.....

Hola,

I put in an order with Raby's aircooled technology because they had the new
bug me video's cheaper,
and offered them up to this list some time ago. I was told they would ship
in 3 weeks or so, and haven't heard back from them or received any replies
to email sent thus far.
I will attempt contact via telephone when I get the time...

did anyone else purchase this item from them? If so, did you get yours?

thanks!
