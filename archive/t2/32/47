Subject: speedo lube

Blew out salvage speedo with compressed air (been
sitting in a bus in Utah weather for a couple years.)
Odometer works and speedo seems to be ok,
But it sticks and doesn't come back down from reading
speed. (Takes like five minutes for it to go back to
20 mph after it's been at 70.)
checked the archives, but no one else seems to have
had this prob.
I drive by feel not by speed limits, so it's not a big
deal, but I'm afraid it will burn out to odometer.
shud i lube the speedo and with what.?
