Hi,

I really empathize with you - not a fun position to be in.

This sounds like my nightmare with a worn out Airflow Meter I had.

In my attempt to figure out what the heck was the problem with my 79, I 
replaced all my lines, filter, fuel pump - made sure there was spark, 
good points, new condensor, good alternator etc. I could get the bus to 
idle if I cranked up the mixture (much more than you are supposed to). 
But still it would not accelerate worth a darn. After I replaced the AFM 
it ran perfectly. What an expensive nightmare!

This is what I was told (take it for what it is worth). The airflow 
meter contains a metal strip, with another piece of metal (conductor?) 
that comes in contact with this strip. When you depress the gas pedal, 
the position of the metal conductor changes on the metal strip. 
Depending on the position on the metal strip, the module will adjust the 
air/fuel mixture. After driving in a certain range, the strip wears down 
in that area. After awhile there is no more conductivity in that area 
and the AFM does not respond (as if the engine were off because there is 
not a closed circuit).
