Subject: RE: [T2] Jump start blues!

Just a quick note that your engine will run off of
battery voltage for a while, that is until there isn't
enough juice to get a spark (spark doesn't use all
that much).  So your Gen light will come on if your
Gen is shot or V reg is gone, but your car will run at
least for a while. 
Also, in regard to "popping the clutch" in first going
backward in a 78 Type 2.  First, you should not pop
the clutch with FI Type 2s.  It can damage the FI
system (I think there is a warning on the driver's
side sun shade). Second, if you popped the clutch in
first going backward, you will rotate the engine the
wrong way.  Now I'm not saying it wont run, seeing as
how I have never tried it, but your timing would be
way off.  Instead of 7.5 degrees BTDC it would be 7.5
ATDC (static timed, and way, way more than that 15
degree difference when you reved).  
Finally, if you only have a hot starter problem and
you just need to get the van started, I have popped
the clutch to get going, even though I know that you
shouldn't, but its better all around to pop the clutch
in second and not in first (Factors: Engine inertia,
lower RPM and clutch).

PS When jumping a dead battery (don't jump start FI
Type 2s) you should bypass the dead battery.  Do this
by connecting possitive terminal to possitive terminal
but negative (earth for those on the other side of the
Atlantic) from good battery to a solid ground (not
dead battery negative terminal).
