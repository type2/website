Subject: need valve job description

Folks,

I really need a good description of what is commonly refered to as a
"3 angle valve job".  With 6 vw's I need to start doing my own valve jobs.

I have found a company that sells manually operated seat cutters(expensive
but good) and need to know what angles are involved in the "3 angle valve
job".

Any article references would be great.  At one time I found a great URL on
the net, but have lost it.


Thanks ,dave
