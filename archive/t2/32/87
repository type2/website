Ok, here's what I did with that combo:

I swapped out the dizzy for an SVDA unit...

...but before I did that, here's how I timed the
009/34-PICT-3 combo:

I timed it at idle to 7.5 degrees BTDC at idle. Then I
took my timing analyzer, dialed it in at 30 degrees
advance, and timed it at 3,000 RPMS. Car ran great,
and the hesitation was fairly minimal.
