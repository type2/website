Subject: vent window assembly

Great and powerful list,

Does anyone have or know of a complete vent window assembly for the driver
side rear window of a bay window? (mine is a 74 Westy). This is the only
piece that is holding back getting this project out of the shop and on the
road. The original piece I have is rusted beyond use and the parts busses I
have looked at have similar problems. The top of the metal frame work is
usually in good or useable condition but the bottoms have completely rusted
away. The glass is not a problem but the metal frame work is. This is not
the metal around the edge of the glass but the frame work the seal fits on.
If anyone has a line on a good used one or know of some one manufacturing
them please let me know.


Thanks in advance.....Dana
