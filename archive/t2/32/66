Subject: Re: [T2] vent window assembly


Dana, list:
Didn't VW eliminate these vent windows in 1978 and 1979? This would be a good
way to eliminate these problem, if you don't care about opening vents in the
back seat area. They used bypassing sliders in the center seat area.
I actually did not PREFER the later windows, nor the sliders on the Vanagons,
because they lead to buffeting noises that the early cars did not have.
