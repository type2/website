Glen,    =20
    I had a similar problem in my ni**an p/u.  The needle had gotten so =
hot in the summer sun, that the plastic needle melted enough to touch =
the speedo face plate.  The needle would stick at certain speeds, but =
with a few whacks on the dash it would drop like normal.  I bent it back =
several times, but ended up replacing the head with a new used one.  =
Does this apply to your bus? Check out your needle.  If it sat in the =
hot Utah sun, I imagine this could be the culprit. =20
I know there are people who specialize in restoring these old VDO =
gauges, but not being as wise as the list nor having a library of =
VWTrends back issues to go through I can't point in the right direction. =
=20
Hope this helps and of course YMMV.
