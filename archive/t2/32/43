I'm saying it won't run.

The normal cycle of operation on a 4-stroke engine is:

Intake stroke, intake valve open, exhaust closed. Fuel and air come in.

Compression stroke, both valves closed. Fuel-air mixture compresses.

Spark plug fires, setting the fuel-air mixture alight.

Power stroke, valves still closed. Piston travels to bottom of cylinder.

Exhaust stroke, intake valve closed, exhaust open. Burnt gases are expelled.


The cycle of operation if you turn the engine backwards is:

"Cleanout stroke." Exhaust valve opens, letting the engine remove anything
that's in the cylinder.

"Piston return stroke." Piston travels to the bottom of its travel, both
valves closed.

Spark plug fires, but since there's nothing in there no combustion is done.

"Spark plug cooling stroke." After that plug fires for no good reason, you
need to cool it off so it doesn't melt.

"Gas wasting stroke." The intake valve opens and a fuel-air mixture is
introduced, only to be dealt with by...

Another cleanout stroke!

Condensed version: if the plug fires on a cylinder with no gas in it, you
don't go very far.
