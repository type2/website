Ask around the list, someone had a new set of seats fo $150.00. Also it helps 
to know were you are at, because someone may know somewhere local you find 
what you want. other than that I really liked you paint job. I'm in the Navy 
(about another year and a half before I retire, Maybe? If they let me?) and 
it does my heart good to see the stars and strips so proudly displayed:) 
Thank-you
