Subject: Re:vent window assembly

Dana,
"Does anyone have or know of a complete vent window assembly for the driver 
side rear window of a bay window?"

   I don't know how much of a concern it is for you to have that vent wing 
window, but when the frame on my 71 got rusty I did away with it.  I put in 
a right rear, one piece,window in the left rear position.  It's the same 
size opening in the body, so fit is not really an issue.
