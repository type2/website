Perhaps I am confused, but I'm pretty sure I'm not. 
(I thought
long and hard about this on the ground behind the
bus.)  My evidence - 
there was muey corrosion on the front terminal, and
that one has the 
black wire.  This is the + terminal on the battery. 
(The corrosion 
matches right up!)  The rearmost terminal has the red
cable, and it 
is the - terminal.  (It is obviously the grounding
strap now that I
follow it....)

When I did the fated jump start, I hooked up the red
jumper cable from
the + on my car, to the red cable in the back of the
bus.  (The red
cable was attached to the - terminal....)

Believe it or not, the bus started.  And man was the
battery hot when
I finally took it out of there!!  *yeesh*  It wouldn't
stay running
though, immediately dying after I disconnected the
cables.  (I did
this a second time, to make sure.)  This seemed odd,
I'd never experienced
this.

Fast forward a day - I put the dead battery back in,
hooked the cables
up properly (half hoping this might reverse the
polarity damage I feared
I'd done), and the bus kept running after I d/c'd the
jumper cables.
Circumstantial evidence at best, but it makes sense.

Guess that's why I felt it died immediately as a
result of the cables
being crossed up.  Keep in mind this old battery is
major DOA!!!!  Perhaps
there wasn't major sparking after hooking the cables
up wrong b/c 
there was nil charge left in the battery. Nada, nil,
nein, none....  
I'm no electrician though, just a guess.

Peace, Milo
