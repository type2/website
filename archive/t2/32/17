Subject: RE:[T2] Jump start blues! - second thread

Milo said : (on his '69 generator VW)  I hooked jumpers up to it from my car 
and it started right up.  But as soon as I unhooked the jumpers, it died.

And then he said : and notice that the red cable in the back
of my bus is indeed, hooked up to the negative terminal, and that
when I jump started it, I had the + from the car hooked up the -
of the bus, and vise-versa....  Well, that explains why she wouldn't
stay running.

I ask : HOW DOES that explain why she would not stay running??? I don't 
understand. I thought that if you got the engine running, so what!!  The 
engine would turn the generator and provide current to the rest of the stuff 
that makes the VW work, and the heck with the battery.  You probably don't 
even NEED a battery to run the '69 generator equiped VW.

Here's my own stupid question...  If I could start my '78 FI alternator 
stick Westy in first gear by coasting BACKWARDS down a grade, would it hurt 
anything?!?!? (it took me quite a while to come up with that ditty...)
