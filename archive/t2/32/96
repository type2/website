How would roll starting hurt the injection??? Basically you are rolling the 
engine over by moving the vehicle. As far as the injection knows you are 
doing it the starter.The Start position on the key isn't connected to the 
fuel injection system except maybe the cold start valve --- but mine hasn't 
worked for a very long time anyhow...

I'll ditto about wear and tear on the tranny and jump starting a injected 
bus. I've done alot of both and you are taking your chances. Yes, second 
gear is much better than 1st.
