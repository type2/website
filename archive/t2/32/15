Hello everone,
I have a 1981 Westfalia, it goes to the old car museum (junk yard)this 
Saturday, It has no motor or tranny, but the rest is there. If any one wants 
parts for free (you pay shipping) let me know. I do have the title if any one 
wants the whole thing. I am located in Mayport, Florida (near Jacksonville)

Max
