Hey Rik,
  That's a good idea. I tried it on the most recent one that crapped out on me. Thanks for the tip though. One other guy has emailed with info that he found a gear at a camera shop that works great. For some reason he say that he can't send info to the list though. Email messed up or something. I'll post the results if anything pans out. That would be great if we could find a replacement without having to send it to some speedo shop. In my case all I need is the one little plastic gear. I'll keep everyone updated on what I find out.

Thanks
Casey
