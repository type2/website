----------------------------------

Several times over the years, on a variety of 2 & 4-cycle gas engines including O/B motors and military vehicles.

In the A/C VW realm I've had brand new Bosch plugs be dead right out of the box; twice on the same vehicle in the same year.

The most dramatic failure was a new Bosch plug that blew it's innards right out of the ceramic shell (-at-) ~4,000 RPM on I-5.  That plug was made in India.
