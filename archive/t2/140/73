I paid $2 then we had to put it back together, but it had been stored

well the compression test tells you a lot but not decisive about weather

how much did they charge for the rebuild, a decent rebuild of the 2liter
engine, done reasonably well is at least $1,500 (my rebuild was almost
$2,500)

shouldn't take more than a month, including chasing down all the parts,
someone who does it for a living (AVP, Boston Bob etc figure about a week)

probably not the engine they rebuilt but caused by the other parts not

NOT SO, no an automatic is not as "zippy" as a manual tranny bus in the
same condition, but on the level you should be able to get up to 60mph or
so in less than a minute.

I don't know which way you went, PA turnpike?? or I-80,  but I drive that
way often and can keep up 45MPH+ on the 8mile grade up to Allegany tunnel

shouldn't downshift an automatic tranny bus it should do it automatically
as soon as the MPH drops below 45 or so.

fuel relay wouldn't be causing that problem. not directly anyway.

well maybe it could be your daily driver and not have another set of
wheels.  ride the transit bus for 6 months while your bus is "laidup"

no it shouldn't,  get a Bentley manual and some tools (this list will give
you all the suggestions you can use) and start getting your hands dirty
because a 24 year old vehicle of any type is gonna need some TLC, and if
you don't have any, the money at least find the time or someone you trust
to help you get going

good luck
