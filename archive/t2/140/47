I've used the same system for my drain plug after looking all over town for

a hex-head socket. I can't take credit for inventing it though, while

looking for a socket to fit, I took a 17mm hex bolt to a hardware store and

told the guy "this fits perfectly" he went over to the metric nut bins and

took out two, screwed them on to the bolt and said "here's your answer." I

looked at it for a couple of seconds and then the lights went on. Not only

is it effective, it cost a fraction of what a wrench or socket would.

Not to beat a dead horse; but was this a "real" hardware store? As in not
Home Depot...One more reason to support your local merchants; hardware,
lumber, electrical, etc. Same goes for your VW parts suppliers. When the
"little guys" (who know what goes with what and not just what aisle that
department is) are gone, who ya gonna blame?
