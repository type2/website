I will let you know, I just bought one. It has not come in yet. I may be
willing to burn a few copies if it turns out to be any good. For the price
of the CD and shipping of course.

It appears that someone has gotten their hands on "official" VW parts manual
software on CD and is selling these on ebarf.

Does anyone know if these are being widely distributed and how legit they
are?

Just curious- I am surprised that VWOA doesn't already have a team of
lawyers on their case
