What works for me may not work for you.
I have a 77. The front bushing on the end of the front tube is totally
different then the earlier buses.
You have a ??  , oops, you did not say.

All the bay shift couplers are the same. The replacements are cheaply made. I
tack weld the hub in a couple of spots where it meets the stamped steel cage.
The new ones are just pressed together there and slip.

The two center tube bushings that look like badminton birdies are incorrectly
repro'd. The 'guide pin' to fit in the hole in the tube is totally wrong and
does not fit. To replace the front one: remove the front section, remove the
coupler, and slide the middle section forward about a foot. Remove old one and
SAVE it. Try to put the new one on and get frustrated. Toss new one. Put old
one back on and put lots of chassis grease around it. Slide tube back in
because there was really nothing wrong with the bushing.....
To do the rear bushing, remove transaxle....because you cannot slide the tube
back far enough.
