Mark,

You are on the right track in looking at the mix over the operating range.  
Why the preset air/fuel map in your air mass sensor isn't correct isn't 
clear. Maybe the PO fooled with it.

As to the meter, I have read that 1,000,000 (1 Meg ohm)ohms/volt or more is 
recommended in order to get near the ideal 0.45 volt = 14.7: air/fuel ratio 
(stoichemetric). The effect of any meter is that (in addition to a voltage 
error) a loading effect error is introduced causing the reading to be lower 
than ideal. Your digital meter may be OK but it makes it harder to compare 
your readings to those of others if digital meter sampling rates, times, and 
impedances differ. Because the voltage is very noisy (jumps around in 
amplitude) a low pass filter ahead of a high impedance meter gives an 
average steady reading. If your reading is steady it is because the ox 
sensor isn't working or the sampling rate and time of your meter is 
fortuitously filtering out the noise.

It pays to be a little careful here because it is harmful to the engine to 
run too lean.

The "ideal 14.7:1 ratio or 0.450 volts" is NOT ideal for air cooled VWs. I 
try for no greater than 13:1 idle or cruise. Sorry but your guess as to what 
13:1 equals on your set up is as good as mine. I would set it at 0.625 volts 
and look at the plugs and exhaust color. Better rich than lean.

Others on the list might be of more specific help.


Good luck

Chuck Watson
