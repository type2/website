Subject: won't start 1971

we have a 1971 vw bus and she started the other day after being stored for 4 
months, then we drove her around a bit came home shut her off. later tried to 
start and turned over slow then nothing, the generator was change about 1 
year ago but do the brushes or something go if they sit, or is there 
something else.
