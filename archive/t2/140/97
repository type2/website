Subject: Alternator conversion question '68

We're converting to an alternator because we've had some problems with our
original generator and it now seems that the voltage regulator is dying
FAST. My man is the one who has the most technical know-how by far and he
says he has the old bug alternator pedestal and old bug pieces necessary to
convert. We also have used bug parts on the engine and an aftermarket fuel
pump which may make the fuel pump and push rod changes unnecessary he says
so we'll see. He was sure that all he needed was the '74 bug alternator. He
came back with one that needed an external regulator and now does not know
for sure what year alternator he needs. He's now going back in hopes that
Pep Boys will show him alternators so he can get one with an internal
regulator. I hope this post makes some sense. I'm the type of person who
likes to do the research first and then run to the stores later but
whatever!

What year bug alternator comes with the conversion kits usually?


Thanks,
Jen
