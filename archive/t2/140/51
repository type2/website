Subject: Re: [T2] Tuning AFM with Oxygen sensor

Hi Mark,
Good to hear from you again.

1. Have you established the correlation between voltage and fuel-air? 2. Do 
you have a High Impedance meter?
3. Can you really adjust the "spring" in the air sensor under cruise (I 
assume the bus would be under load and moving) conditions. I drove around 
with the air sensor lid off once and the pot wiper was very very busy as was 
the spring.
