Subject: It could be worse...or could it?

What you need now is a mentor to help you through your present situation.
This person could advise as to local resources, give some first hand
mechanical advice or assistance, and generally steer you in the right
direction.

The only people I would recommend in the NYC area are Billy Johnson & Wing
(or Weng).
They were street Mechanics in the Bronx. They now have a shop. Billy has
been making
VWs run for at least 20 years, Wing is a superclean working all bosch boxes
in a milkcrate Jamacian Vanagon/early bus transmission mechanic.

Take Southern Parkway south from Fordham Road until you intersect Boston
Post Rd & McKinley, follow Mckinley 20 feet, take a right onto 169th, follow
it to Crotona park (2 blocks), Make two lefts, look for their shop in a
garage set back up a driveway from the street. Ask anyone where Billy is if
you don't see it. Stay aware of your surroundings and make sure it's
daytime. Bring Billy a Tea with lemon no sugar from the Bodega, tell him
Chris & Joseph from TheMotorHole sent you. With the problem you describe,
you're going to have to spend/assess and be patient, but at least Billy will
give you the most sensible & honest advice in NYC.
