I would also note that there can be air leakage from the area of the
potentiometer into the system, altering the reading.  You'll notice that
when you pried the "D" shaped plastic piece off for the first time there was
sealer between the plastic cover and the metal body of the AFM.  I've found
it's best to adjust the spring (I've always done it with the engine off),
give it a quick check (plastic cover off) and then replace the cover using
temporary sealer (making tape's fine) and test again.  You may find that the
readings "cover off" vs. "cover on" can be quite a bit different.
