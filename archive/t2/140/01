Hi Folks,

The saga continues, but the end is in sight.  We made it to Reno, and have 
been working on Mick's Bus ever since.  The spring plates got aligned, the 
rear brakes have been rebuilt, the new shocks are on, and the new flex hoses 
are on.  All that's left is bleeding the brakes and checking the steering 
box.  We hope to be on the road back East by this afternoon, to Ely by thius 
evening, and back to Aspen by Sunday.

As for Sweet Pea, she's fixed, but still in Ely, Nevada.  The local mechanic 
fixed the rocker shaft studs, and got the engine running well again.  Total 
charge: $165.  That's not bad for 3 hours of labor and a few parts, 
especially in an emergency situation like this.  Even better, I 
theoretically have a Bus that will get me back home, though my confidence in 
the whole experience has been diminished somewhat.

Thanks again for all the suggestions and offers of help.  This is a great 
group of people!
