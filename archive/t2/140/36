Subject: What to do?

All this talk about unrestored buses is hitting home.  I have a '71 Westy
with an honest 59K on it.  The body is badly rusted along the rockers and
corners, the interior is beautiful (PO had it for 27 years, no kids, used it
two weeks a year).  I've had the brakes completely redone (new drums,
slaves, calipers, etc.), and the engine ran perfectly until just before I
garaged it almost two years ago.  It starts right up and runs around like an
old friend when I run it occassionally, but smokes after it warms up.  I
haven't run that one down yet.

My point is that it pains me to have it sit there.  I'm a year behind on a
house restoration job, and I just can't pay any attention to it.  It's not
even registered at the moment.  The new house has a nasty little one car
garage, and the second car is going to sit off to the side on the driveway
as it is.

Maybe it's time to just say goodbye, and get another when I have room.  It
cheers me up just sitting in it, and as my daughter once said, you just
can't be angry when you're driving the bus.

I can't be the only listee who's had to face this one, and it's Friday.  It
isn't the money, it's the space.  What do you say:  I don't want to store it
way out elsewhere, but I feel stuck and the clock is ticking.  Thoughts?
