I took a chance and bought an automatic =9278 bus with a camper =
conversion=20
last April for $500. It had been sitting in the PO=92s driveway probably=20=

for about 7 years. It had a very solid body and no rust underneath,=20
which is somewhat rare in this neck of the woods. I had it towed to a VW=20=

repair shop in New Jersey that was recommended by a couple of people on=20=

the aircooled VW newsgroup. After installing a new fuel pump, fuel=20
lines, and repairing a few other items, they decided to do a compression=20=

test. It was then that they discovered that the engine was shot. I was a=20=

wee bit ticked off because it seemed sensible to do a compression test=20=

first before doing anything else. The repairs at this point were already=20=

about $1000. It was either throw in the towel or go ahead and have them=20=

rebuild the engine. So I decided to go with the rebuild as I figured=20
that it was something I would have to do down the line anyway.  At least=20=

this way, I thought, I wouldn=92t have to worry about when the engine=20
would go.
	Months passed and still the bus was not ready. They just kept=20
saying they were having a hard time getting parts. Soon the summer was=20=

over and I was still without my bus. Finally, in late September, after=20=

about 6 months of =93working on it," it was ready. They gave me a 3,000=20=

mile/3 month warranty on the engine work. They told me to bring it back=20=

after I put 1000 miles on it so they could make any necessary=20
adjustments to the engine.
Almost immediately upon getting it home, it began stalling when I=20
started it up and shifted it into drive. I=92ve never driven a bus =
before,=20
but I thought this was odd considering it=92s a FI bus. I called the=20
repair shop and they said that, if I could handle the stalling, it would=20=

be best to wait until I put about 1000 miles on it before bringing it in=20=

so they could take care of everything at once. So I got used to the=20
stalling at startup and just drove it as much as I could. Pretty soon=20
after driving it out of the city (I live in NYC), I realized it had no=20=

power whatsoever on even the slightest of inclines. I asked around about=20=

this and most people seemed to think that was my fate with an automatic=20=

bus. So I got used to that too. By this point, it was stalling much more=20=

frequently and not just when I started it up. I decided to drive it home=20=

to Cleveland, OH for Thanksgiving. Until then, I had only put about 150=20=

miles on it. The trip would give me a chance to really see how it=20
performed on the highway and it would put the magical 1000 miles on it=20=

so I could take it to the repair shop when I got back.
On the highway, my girlfriend and I experienced the invigorating thrill=20=

of nearly being rear-ended by eighteen-wheelers every time we hit the=20
slightest hill. We soon learned to make advantageous use of=20
straight-aways and to downshift into 2nd as soon as we approached that=20=

wouldn=92t present a challenge to your average golf cart. After a drive=20=

that added a few years to each of our lives, we made it off the highway=20=

in Cleveland. Then, naturally, it began stalling at every single light=20=

until I thought I was going to have to push it the rest of the way home.=20=

Eventually we made it there, but the next time I tried to drive it, it=20=

=93died=94 after stalling about 20 times. I had no means to get it fixed=20=

that holiday weekend so I called my VW repair shop in NJ when I got back=20=

to NYC. They said it was probably a fuel relay issue and that they would=20=

be willing to send parts out there to get it fixed if I knew someone who=20=

could run a few tests first to see if that=92s what it was. Well, I =
didn=92t=20
and I didn=92t want to deal with it anymore then. So I decided to let it=20=

sit for the winter in my family=92s driveway in Cleveland.
This past week I finally had it towed to a bus shop in Cleveland. I=20
figured I would be looking at a fuel relay issue and not much else. He =20=

ran a compression test and found that one of the cylinders is blown.=20
This, I would venture a guess, is why it ran with about as much power as=20=

a tricycle. So now I have the pleasure of trying to make the VW repair=20=

shop in NJ honor the engine warranty and pay for the repairs for a bus=20=

that=92s being worked on by a shop in Cleveland. I couldn=92t be more =
pissed=20
and just generally nauseous about this whole situation. I=92ve now had =
the=20
bus for about a year and have driven it for a total of about 6 weeks. I=20=

paid enough money on the initial repairs to buy a bus that was in far=20
better shape. Lesson learned. On Friday, I talked to the repair shop in=20=

NJ and explained the situation. He said he would call the shop in=20
Cleveland to find out exactly what the problem was. He didn=92t, of=20
course, and I caught him in a lie about it later that day, though I=20
didn=92t call him on it. He did say he would =93try calling again=94 on =
Monday=20
and that he would be willing to send him the parts the Cleveland shop=20
needed plus help pay for the charges. The bus did break down after only=20=

650 miles and about 6 weeks and I did call him at the time to tell him=20=

about it. But, after waiting this long, the 3-month warranty period is=20=

probably lawfully over. So, I feel like I=92m in a really awful =
situation.=20
I want to lay into the NJ VW shop for doing such a gawdawful job and=20
have them pay for all of the engine-related repairs, but I also worry=20
that they might not be lawfully bound to. As much as it angers me, it=20
might be better to have them pay for part of it then none of it at all,=20=

assuming I can get them to do this. Does anyone have a similarly awful=20=

experience that could shed some light on how to deal with this?=20
Hopefully I don=92t sound too dramatic. I realize that this isn=92t the =
end=20
of the world, but it has really soured my experiences with buses. It=20
shouldn=92t be this painful to have a bus that runs. Thanks for letting =
me=20
vent.

Steve
