You are letting these mechanics put way too much emphasis on compression
tests.  If that was all you had to show it was blown when you first had it
worked on, then that was not enough, and you should have demanded more
explanation, especially since after 7 years of sitting there could be
various things wrong that might be correctable without an engine rebuild.
There is a real art to getting one going that has been sitting for a long
time but the right techniques can work miracles.  Besides, many auto
mechanics I've seen use the regular old compression gauge instead of a
differential type, and this will not give the best determination of where
your problem lies within the engine.  This is especially true with your dead
cylinder you have now which might not be that bad of a problem.  Don't ever
trust what an auto mechanic tells you.  Just because they are "pros" doesn't
mean they know how to diagnose a problem correctly.  There's hardly a
profession where the qualifications and skills of the practitioners vary so
widely.  If that bus was really that rust free underneath then it was still
quite cheap.  I recently paid $4500 for a Westfalia that is in good rust
free shape, and I have managed to go 6 breakdowns in the first 500 miles,
and only now is it all coming together.  Check out Ebay or other sources and
see what nice buses go for in the Northeast.  Sometimes we are talking
$6-8,000 for nice campers.  I have learned the hard way that a machine of
any particular quality costs a certain amount, no matter whether you put the
money in at once when you buy or bit by bit afterwards.  Good luck.  Glen W
