Subject: Windshield wiper woes...

Well, I was tightening the bolts on my wipers today, and the passenger side 
bolt snapped right in half. It's the 72-style bolt that has a 13mm hex top 
with a rounded dome and a hollow, threaded shaft to go around the wiper arm 
peg. As a result, I have a round nut burrowed inside the wiper arms, with no 
way to reach it from the outside, let alone get a grip on it. Anybody know 
what I'll have to do to get this thing off and replace it? Will I have to 
take the whole assembly out?
