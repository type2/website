Wallyworld has basic Unidens for $10 each.  The only bad FRS radios I've
come across were from BellSouth.  I really like the Uniden Ecotrek $10
specials I bought,  Easy to operate, no bells or whistles to screw up, and
a very handy carabiner clip to hang them from things.

They are in the 460MHz region.  If you google on "frequency" and "FRS"
you'll probably find the exact numbers.

No, and that's one of the nice things about FRS.  It does what CB was
intended to do in the first place, provide short-range reliable
communications.  It's been years since I've received any valuable
information from a trucker on a CB.
