Subject: Re: [VB] tranny drain plug trick

if you have the means, you can also take two 17mm bolts and weld the threaded 
ends together.  Stick one of the bolt heads into the drain plug and put your 
17mm socket onto the other and twist away.

Watercooled VW lug  nuts are 17mm and easy to find.  Would probably  be best 
to shorten them a bit to reduce the stress on the weld when torquing.
