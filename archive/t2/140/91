I have pulled out the westfakia equipment in my bus (country home =
conversion)
I purchased a zbed out of a 78 (or so) for $20 at a recycle yard and =
will build my own
cabinets around it. I went to the article section  of the web site and =
re-read the article on
heating/sound  dampening. I can not find the exact materials talked =
about in the article,
but did find some stuff on the web. Any body have any experience with =
McMaster
      Adhesive-Back Damping Sheets =20
          Just peel back the pressure-sensitive adhesive backing to bond =
these sheets to surfaces such as ducts, pipes, and enclosures to control =
vibration.=20
           Polymeric mastic and mastic sheets are asphalt-based; all =
others are made of super-flexible, thermoplastic PVC. Chemical-resistant =
thermoplastic sheets are USDA compliant for incidental food contact. =20
             =20
    =20

the price is right $13 for a 32"X54" sheetand I found similar stuff at =
JC Whitney -=20
again anyone have experience with these materials.=20
I will use one of these for the firewall, wheel wells and on the floor =
and deck in the back=20
and maybe some similar material with foam for the floor and deck - see =
how that goes and then
work on the front/cab. I will  not go as far as the article goes (time, =
money, less fanatic etc...).=20
Any body have any hints comments or common errors around build one's own =
cabinits in a bus
please let me know.
On a different subject, I am contemplating an external oil cooler- any =
leads on an air scoop to cover=20
the cooler. I like the look of the scoop much more than the bare cooler. =
TIA!!
