Subject: Re: [T2] anti-seize + dead plug

While putting light oil on the threads may be applicable in vehicles
maintained regularly by someone as conscientious as Dr Tim (for whom I
have great respect), for the rest of the planet anti-seize is the ticket.
Light oil does not last very long in that environment, and we are trying
to prevent corrosion here.  Better to be able to get it out than to worry
about subtle changes in torque.
	We used P&W's aluminum based anti-seize on the hot section
fasteners on JT-3D's and that is above most VW temps.  Used to scrape the
"thick stuff" off the bottom of the can as a "sealer" for two-stroke
racing engine head gaskets with excellent results.  I have paid the price
for NOT using it many more times than three or four in 20 years.  Steel
(particularly stainless) and aluminum just do not seem to be happy campers
when in close proximity.
	IMHOP when the plug pulls the insert out it is probably due to a
build up of something below the insert i.e. inside the combustion chamber
or corrosion between the plug and insert (preventable by anti-seize).  
The crud below the insert could be carbon from fuel, oil or anti-seize or
some other combustion by-product.  Plug threads were not meant to be
exposed to combustion chamber gasses.  
	Dr Tim makes an excellent point in saying plugs should go in with
finger pressure and be tightened to correct torque on the (preferably new)
gasket washer.
	I have used aluminum based anti-seize for most of my mechanicing
but my Dad, a professional mechanic for 50 years, preferred copper based
stuff.

On another topic.  How many of you, and how many times have y'all had a
spark plug actually FAIL?  Not "I changed the plugs, etc., etc. and she
came to life" but verifiable "dead plug".
