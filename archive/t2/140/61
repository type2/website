 In my 70' Kombi I have a late type trans that looks, and performs well. =
However, oil leaks
out at the drive shafts. Looking at the Bentley manual, it would appear =
that the problem is=20
the oil seal around the axle shaft.
 Questions...
1. Is this a relatively easy fix?
2. Does this indicate bigger problems? extreme age?
3. Am I better off using the other trans that I have had sitting around?
It too is of indeterminate mileage and has been sitting outside for =
about 15 years.

Thanx, Jako
