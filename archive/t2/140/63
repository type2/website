Asking prices for baywindow buses seem to have nearly doubled out here in the Pac. NW over the past 18 months or so.  Don't know if they're actually selling at the elevated prices, just my observation based on reading a lot of newspaper ads.

Does this mean that baywindow buses have finally been "discovered"?
