Subject: Re: [T2] Seat Belts

I have some out of a Jetta (I think late '80s).  They have the
self-adjusting inertia reel.  They required a short strap-steel extension
to get them in the right position, but they are well worth the effort.
Being that they are inside their own covered inertial reel, they do not
receive the sun damage of normal belts, so they will probably be in good
shape.
