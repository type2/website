Subject: a type 4 motor, what is it?

Hello all,
 i picked up a type 4 motor that was in a 73 bus but it is kinda strange, It
has dual carbs and the oil filler is on the top of the motor on the breather
box and the dip stick is from the top as well. I looked where the bus filler
and dipstick go but there was no holes in the tin or shroud.
I copied the Case #  EA042420
 Any Ideas??
 Thanks,
 Bryan
