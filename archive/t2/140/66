 >>  1. Have you established the correlation between voltage and fuel-air? =

Yes. When I tighten the spring, the mixture gets leaner and the voltage =
goes down and vice-versa.

>>2. Do you have a High Impedance meter?

I should know the meaning of impedance (Dad's an engineer), but.. this is =
a small digital radio-shack meter. I do think the meter is working =
correctly since it seems to be giving me values of the expected range -- 0 =
volt to 950 millivolt.

 >>  3. Can you really adjust the "spring" in the air sensor under cruise =
(I=20
 >>  assume the bus would be under load and moving) conditions. I drove =
around=20
 >>  with the air sensor lid off once and the pot wiper was very very busy =
as was=20
 >>  the spring.

What I was doing was stopping the bus, adjusting the spring, then driving =
again. I was not actually moving the spring position while in motion. That =
would take two people and seems a little dangerous for the one in the back =
;-)
