Hmmm...I guess it depends on how self explanatory the pictures and diagrams are.? My German is, uhh, well, not so much.? Is anyone able to translate?? Come to think of it, there is a guy working at my firm who I think is from Germany...I guess I could ask him to try.

I have a solex (factory) carb book, but it is in German. I wonder, if an English version might be floating on the web somewhere. I could scan mine, but I am not sure how much that would help with it being in German ...?
