Subject: Lifting

Does anyone know of any good resources for information about lifting a 
transporter? I know of a place near me in salem, oregon (I think its 
west coast metric, off the top of my head) that takes core spindles and 
turns them into lift spindles. And thats probably how I would go for the 
front end... but what about the rear end? I keep hearing the term 
"re-indexing" for VW's when it comes to adjusting rear end suspension 
but I've never heard any details on whats involved in doing this. If its 
anything like the front end of my 74 beetle, I don't see how you could 
do much of anything without welding. Also... CV's: How much of a lift 
will the stock ones handle? Is there an interchangable VW CV that could 
handle the greater camber?

I'm not thinking of a ton of lift... buses are already pretty high, just 
looking for 2-3 inches and a heavy sway bar.

Thanks,
-Nate
