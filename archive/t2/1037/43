I have noticed that a remanufactured AFM has been sealed with silicon
goop on the top cover.  And as such, I have always wondered if the
top cover being loose was a source of 'false air' to the EFI system.

Many of the AFMs I have discovered in junkyards have not been sealed
and once in a while, the top cover of the AFM is not found.

Sorry to report I have not tried a Vanagon AFM on my '78 EFI system.
