Try Napa #58598.  Chevy Astro-Van IIRC?.  I'm through one set, well into the second.  You will need to shim the top of the shock to offest it outwards on the attach point, I used a large nut but a bunch of washers should work too.

Some folks have reported breaking off the top shock mount with coil-overs.  Technically, mine are "temporary" until I have time to do the torsion bars, but other priorities keep arising...
