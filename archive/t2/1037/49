Subject: Re: brake adjusters

Last I looked, NO USA bay window bus came with self-adjusters unless someone
converted to Vanagon self-adjusting rear brakes.

ke sure you get them on the correct sides when you put your brakes back
together. Otherwise you will retract your brakes with the auto-adjust feature
instead of expand whenneeded. Once had some hardware for the front of my 65
Mustang that I stuck in the wrong boxes at the parts counter. For some reason
this hardware kit didnt have the L or R embossed in the bracket like the oem
stuff did. Having drum brakes on all four wheels was scary enough then when
the front shoes retracted from backing up it made stopping even more scary!!
