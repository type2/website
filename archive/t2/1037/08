Subject: My coil upgrade

Just got my new Blue Super Coil from BD. I just switched it out with the one
that I was running. Here are a couple of pictures of the old one...

Funny thing is, it ran for quite a few years with little issue. BUt I did
notice as stated on the Ratwell page that when I shook the black one, the
oil inside sloshed around like a can of V8!

Notice that there are no marking showing what brand it might have been...
Guess the person who installed it lucked out.

Now I'm excited to see how Zoey runs with her new coil!
