Subject: Re: One more thing on the coil 

Does the coil still work? I know you said you replaced it with a new blue super coil, but if the old one still actually works, then you may want to keep it as a spare. Coils WILL fail abrubptly, when they do fail. When this happens the only thing you CAN do is just replace it, so I would keep it in a spare parts box that you keep in your Bus. I keep a small tool box that I have a few spare parts. An electric fuel pump (purolator 4psi), some plug wires, some basic tools, a spare belt, several lengths of wire, and a spare coil.

 Anyone got a suggestion on how I would go about disposing of the old coil in 
 a more environmentally friendly way? I don't really want to just pitch it. 
 Not with it being filled with oil and all.
