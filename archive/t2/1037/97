well there is a "under the table" way of lengthening (and also
shortening) half shafts.  the Automatic transmission is offset in the
bus so the half shafts are different lengths, one just a bit longer
the other a bit shorter than the manual tranny shafts.  to raise a bus
use the longer shaft and to lower a bus use the shorter one, should
get you at least another inch or three.

the CV joints won't take much beyond thier current limits
