Subject: Radio repair

I just picked up an old, late 60's/early 70s Grundig radio with 2 AM bands
(L, M) and an FM band (U) from the parts yard.  It's the same model I had in
my old 71 super beetle that I "threw out" as a foolish teenager.  I cleaned
it up (looks GREAT!) and put it in my bus.  Almost everything works great.
FM reception is strong and clear, all the buttons and knobs work great and
cosmetically it cleaned up into a real beauty - but I'm getting no reception
(or sound for that matter) on the L and M bands and the light bulb is burned
out.  Does anyone know of a good repair shop that specializes in old VW
radios?  Close to Ventura, CA would be nice.  I don't want it concours
"restored", but it would be nice to have AM and a dial light.

Thanks,
Nick
