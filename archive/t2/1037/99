Along the vein of thought that Jon Stiles advocates for the rear is what I
would recommend -  the Bus Boys' "Boomerang" Plates normally used for
lowering the Bay Window, but in reverse.  See this link:

Granted, this accomplishes a 3 to 4" raising of the rear end and 930 CVs
would definitely be called for to accounting for the radical angle of the
axle shafts.

My nickel's worth....
