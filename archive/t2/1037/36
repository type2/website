Since the seals are broken, I would assume that the inside 
ones might be dirty as well.  I think that's just as 
realistic of an assumption that they're not dirty ;)

You could try soaking them in brake fluid and see if that 
frees them, or you could just hook them up to the bus 
brake lines and pump 'em out.
