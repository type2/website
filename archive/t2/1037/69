Success! Thanks for all your advice.... I took a sparkplug wrench on an
extension to my pushrod tubes tonight and seated them with a deadblow...
worked like a charm and it now runs with 0% oil loss. Speaking of running,
yeah... It turned out to be a simple fuel starvation. I changed the filter
and replaced some lines in the engine compartment and it runs like a
slightly offbalance top. There's a huge deadspot in the beginning of
acceleration which makes it difficult to get it going smoothly in second....
but I"m planning on switching to electronic ignition right away so that
should take care of that. I've been running electronic ignition on the
1600DP in my 74 bug for the past 9 months and it hasn't caused any issues
yet... so I'm fairly confident in them.

Thanks again everyone.
