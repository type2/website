Honestly, I do not know how to tell distributors apart save for whether or
not they have a vacuum advance by the vacuum lines going to the circular
device attached. This one is not vacuum advance though, it has a small
cylindrical device attached with I believe a red wire coming out. Not sure
if that at all identifies it but thats what comes to mind.
