Subject: sunroofs, air valves and heat - oh my!

First I wanted to thank the list for their help with my metal sliding
sunroof.  I got my seal on, the sunroof is installed and while it doesn't
work like "butter" yet, that baby closes and seals!  As an aside - I found
that the plastic crank gear cover from a beetle WILL fit the bus sunroof and
function properly (despite the claims from the internet parts houses that it
would not fit).  I had to do a little trimming and "cleaning up" of the
part, but it fit fine.

I also wanted to see if anyone had any experience with the Python
brand Auxillary Air Valve.  It's a remanufactured Bosch part sold through JC
Whitney "guaranteed to meet or exceed OE manufacturers specs".  It was only
$50 bucks, the part is no longer available new and the guy on the web I
found who still had new ones was asking $300!  When I get it installed I'll
let you know how it works.  JC lists it as being for a FI Type 1, but
according to ratwell the part # is the same for the bus.

Last, I need a heater tube for my 79 CA bus.  It is on the driver's side and
goes from the bottom of the engine tin to the heater box.  I think this is
another one of those 1979 CA only parts.  I rigged something up that kind of
works, but it's not sealed and looks like crud.  Please let me know if you
have one you'd be willing to part with.

Thanks,
Nick
