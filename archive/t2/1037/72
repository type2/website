Subject: Re: back on seatbelts - grommet needed

Mike said: So, I'm not sure what it's called, but I'm sure many of you will
know what I'm talking about. Most new cars have this little piece of plastic
in somewhere along the seatbelt that keeps the latch part of the belt from
sliding all the way down to the floor when it's retracted. Does anyone know
where to find one of these? I purchased the retractable seatbelts from gowesty
and they're great. Only problem is their adjustable sliding stopper broke and
I need to find a replacement.

That button is available from your local Mercedes dealer. It comes as two
halves, one has a pin. After you push the two halves together, you use a
soldering gun to melt the pin.  Not cheap........
Part number  1298680087  and  1298680187.
