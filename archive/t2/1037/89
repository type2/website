Subject: RE: [T2] Rear Airshocks for a Bay Westy?

I've had them on my 71 Westy for many years.? They were installed by my VW mechanic and he does not recall where they came from.? If you like, I can send pictures.

There is something in the archives about using coil over shocks from a GMC Astro van or some such thing, as I recall.
