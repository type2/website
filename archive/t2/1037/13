Subject: Need to source a Brake Booster "T" Fitting

I know I saw that someone was selling this thing, but for the life of me, I
can't think of who it was. I am looking for the rubber "T" or more
anatomically shaped "Y" that connects the Brake Booster to the plenum and
decel valve.

If they aren't obtainable anymore, anyone have a method I can use to fab
one? Anyone had to fab one?
