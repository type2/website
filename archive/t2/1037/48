Subject: brake adjusters

Make sure you get them on the correct sides when you put your brakes back together. Otherwise you will retract your brakes with the auto-adjust feature instead of expand when
  needed. Once had some hardware for the front of my 65 Mustang that I stuck in the wrong boxes at the parts counter. For some reason this hardware kit didnt have the L or R embossed in the bracket like the oem stuff did.  Having drum brakes on all four wheels was scary enough then when  the front shoes retracted from backing up it made stopping even more scary!!
