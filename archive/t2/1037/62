Hey Nathan,

      Well, there are a few things to take into consideration. Do you have new pushrod tube seals? Bus Depot sells them individually I believe, but I bought more or less a complete set for my pushrods. I think I paid something like $3 bucks? It was extremely cheap.

Are you re-using your old ones? You might benefit from just getting brand new ones. Bus Depot also sells them. When I got them, I hit them with some hi-temp engine primer, and then nailed them with some hi-temp engine enamel (silver). This makes it easier to see where the leak is coming from. With new seals on new pushrod tubes, you shouldn't have any leaks.

You'll also want to paint them too because they'll rust almost immediately too.

As to properly seating them, I took a spark plug socket tool. I forget what sizes they call them, but there are two "standard" sized plugs. I used the spark plug socket that's for the bigger plugs. I turned it around. The "typical" spark plug sockets are almost all identical. The tapered portion I inserted into the pushrod tube from the cyl head. It seated perfectly and then I pounded the open side of the socket with a hammer. It seated perfectly with a couple of good solid whacks from the hammer. Oh yeah, I would coat the O-rings with some oil, this will help them slide into place. This works especially well (using the spark plug socket) because A) Everyone has one, B) it seats in the tube perfectly so it doesn't distort or damage the pushrod tube in ANY way.

Good luck!

 Hey, what do you guys recommend for making sure the push-rod tubes on a 
 2000cc T4 are seated? I did a partial rebuild from cylinders #1 & #2, up 
 this weekend to repair a blown head gasket on my new bus. But when I 
 dumped oil in the motor it just ran out of the push rod tubes. I have 
 them in there, but they're still loose so I obviously didn't seat them 
 correctly. Is it okay to hold something up that matches the outside edge 
 of the tube, such as some PVC pipe and bang on that to seat them? I'm 
 afraid it could rip the O-Ring seals going into the case.
