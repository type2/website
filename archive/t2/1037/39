Subject: Has anyone tried  a Vanagon ('84)  AFM in a earlier 76-79 bus?

I got a $25 (rebuilt?-clean, repainted, track not worn)) AFM at a 
campout, and its numbers, according to Karl, are for an AC Calif. 
Vanagon, 84 yr- but I opened it up and compared it to a 77 spare I have 
and the Specs on checking the pins with an ohmeter seem to be the same- 
only difference I'd need a strain gauge to check would be the resistance 
pressure of the flapper as it is pulled open by engine vacuum.  It 
"feels" a little easier than the 77, which however has use dirt and may 
thus have more resistance? Anyone have a chart of air flow in cc's  vs 
resistance selected by the wiper position?  BTW, in doing my checks 
(blowing into the intake end), I noticed that if the top of the AFM is 
not sealed, air can leak through it during running and thus not let the 
flapper pull as far as it should- resulting in lean conditions?
