Hello, today is my birthday, and yesterday when I got home from work, there
were about 8 packages of VW parts I had ordered and been awaiting....and they
all came at once!!  Coincidence, I don't care, 'cause now I can finish my
complete (body work, motor, suspension etc.) rebuild of my '74 Westy, and...I
am that close!  I am excited!
