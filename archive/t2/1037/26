i have seen so many crap attempted fixes to this part! we have a shop  
and 50% of the buses we get in here need this part replaced, they  
have 3 feet of electical tape wrapped around it, have shoe goo gobbed  
onto it etc.

yes it costs a bit of dough but it is a genuine part, it fits  
perfectly and it work exactly as it should. that is all you can ask  
and most times that is more or less priceless. there are so many crap  
parts out there it is a pleasure to install one of these on a bus  
with a brittle old cracked thing and have it just fit and work.
