Subject: Re: [T2] back on seatbelts - grommet needed

Saw a slot down a piece of 1/2" plastic pipe leaving a 3/4 inch overhang 
on each side of the belt. Cap the open ends with end caps. A pair of 
small screw hose clamps (raid the chem lab or check aquarium stores) 
would work also.

I purchased the retractable seatbelts from gowesty and they're great.
  Only problem is their adjustable sliding stopper broke and I need to
  find a replacement.
