Subject: back on seatbelts - grommet needed

So, I'm not sure what it's called, but I'm sure many of you will know 
what I'm talking about.  Most new cars have this little piece of plastic 
in somewhere along the seatbelt that keeps the latch part of the belt 
from sliding all the way down to the floor when it's retracted.  Does 
anyone know where to find one of these?

I purchased the retractable seatbelts from gowesty and they're great. 
Only problem is their adjustable sliding stopper broke and I need to 
find a replacement.

Thanks,
Mike
