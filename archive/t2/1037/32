Subject: Brake Caliper dust seals

Richard Atwell mentions at SQUEALING BRAKES FAQ

http://www.ratwell.com/technical/FAQ/FAQContent.html


Calipers suffer from a couple of problems:

   - the pistons have rotated because the backing plate tabs have flattened.

   - the dust seal has torn and contaminted the inner seal.

My dust seals are torn & my calipers are now off the VW and sitting on my
work bench.  I belive my inner seals are OK.

I don't have ready access to compressed air to follow the caliper rebuild
procedures outlined in various manuals.

Question: Without the capability of removing the pistons (I don't have
compressed air), is there a practical way to replace just the torn dust
seals without breaking out the pistons and rebuilding the calipers
themselves?
