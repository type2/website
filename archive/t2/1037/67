I've heard that mixing and matching various lifters/cams can be a bad 
idea.. especially used ones.  I personally wouldn't do it.. but if you 
don't really mind if things go south, then I'd give it a try.  If there 
is wear on the other lifters such that they don't rotate properly, 
things will definitely fail.

as always, ymmv..
