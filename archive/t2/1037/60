IF you have a fuel injected engine (ignore if carbs) there is a plug
on the back side of the Air Flow Meter, which is between the Air
Cleaner and the intake elbow if that plug comes loose it runs like
crap if it runs at all, since it is on the 1-2 side it is easy to
accidently jiggle it loose.  only one big 7 or 8 pin plug (depending
on year)
