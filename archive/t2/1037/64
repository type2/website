Subject: Type 1 Engine - Generator Belt

I just replaced mine (type 1, 1600 DP, stock 71 westy), as it seemed to be  
stretched out and even with all of the shims on the outside of the pully, I  
could not get it tight enough to stop it from flopping around and making wierd  
noises.  I installed my spare, and now, with all of the shims on the inside  
of the pully, the belt is real tight - but no more flopping around and no more  
wierd noises.  I have to push pretty hard to get that 1/2 inch of  
deflection.  I can't seem to find any guidance as to how tight it should be  - at least 
not in any of my Bentley books.
 
What I did find is this:

This makes sense to me, but just to cover the bases, and maybe quantify the  
1/2 inch deflection some what better, I thought additional opinions would be  
good to have.
 
Also, since my spare is now installed, I need to get another one, and I'm  
not sure what to get or where to get it.  Can I just go to the FLAPS and  buy 
what they have, or is this something I need to be more picky about?
