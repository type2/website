Subject: Brake Adjusters Lubrication

With the brake adjusters out and apart (The star
wheels and inner threaded extension screw) AND all
spanky clean - what do you guys use to lubricate them?

I have been using anti-seize compound, but am not
happy with the results. Maybe it's just been too many
years!
This time I used graphite without any carrier goo.-BaH
