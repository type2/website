Subject: Re: [T2] Carb rebuild is a success!

I'm sure somebody on here will provide some great info. I would just like to
add a question or two...

1) Where is best place to order a carb rebuild kit for this particular carb?
2) Where can get an electro-magnetic cutoff valve for this carb?

Maybe I'm just not looking in the right place, but I haven't had much
luck...

Thanks!
