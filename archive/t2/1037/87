Subject: Re: [T2] Neat water injection article

Hi Don,

The water consumption they report is very high... About 4x what I 
experienced during the short water injection experiment I did last summer.

I will try WI again, but not before I get at least 5000 miles of 
documented history on this engine. Last year I tried it out without any 
real idea how the engine was working without it, and that left me with 
no way to prove if the WI was helpful or harmful.

Running WI with megasquirt II would be interesting... That would allow 
water injection rates to be mapped to ignition timing, so as to make the 
most of the octane boost. But as they mention in the article you posted, 
the pumping or metering equipment currently used in automotive 
applications is NOT compatible with water. Perhaps some research into 
other industries might uncover a suitable technology, we'll have to see.

In the meanwhile, I'll probably stick with the syringe and water bottle 
that I used last time around.
