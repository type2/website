Well said Scott!

It is still amazing to see that people will spend 6 times the time and the
expense to "reinvent the wheel", especially VW owners.  If you can't afford
the "real deal" or the correct item which will in turn last at least as long
as your original part did in the first place, then it's time to dump that
VW ________ (fill in the blank) and buy a H*nda Odessey.

These "Y"s are subject to a lot of heat abuse, especially in Vanagon engine
compartments and the originals last a LONG time, so the material is pretty
good from an OE perspective.

There are times to be cheep and then times not to be.  This is one of those
times to not be cheep.  Of course, the Euro and Dollar exchange sucks these
days, but that them there is the breaks these days......
