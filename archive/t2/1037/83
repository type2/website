If I'm not mistaken, the Weber progressive carb does not have an  
electromagnetic cutoff valve, so, if that is really the case, no matter how  closed the 
throttle is at engine shutdown, there is still a path for fuel/air to  flow 
through the idle circuit and enable dieseling to occur.
 
Also, again, if I'm not mistaken, the Weber either does not have a vacuum  
port for hooking up vacuum advance, or the vacuum signal that is available is  
not compatible with VW vacuum distributors.  So that would predispose one  to 
use the non-vacuum .009 distributor, when installing the Weber.
 
Dieseling can be a result of many factors, including avialability of  
fuel/air, compression ratio, carbon buildup, fuel octane rating, and I'm sure  I've 
missed others.
