A guess (and that's all it is). T is temperatur (or therm...). What's 
left (144?) is for illumination (so it can be dimmed with the dash 
lights).

(attempting to send AGAIN, because of the extremely lame "too much 
quoted" filter on the type 2 list which forces people to remove context 
and add too much unnecessary filler material to their posts in order to 
get them to go past the policy.
