If I'm  not mistaken, the Weber progressive carb does not have an   
electromagnetic cutoff valve, so, if that is really the case, no matter  how  
closed the 
throttle is at engine shutdown, there is still a path  for fuel/air to  flow 
through the idle circuit and enable dieseling  to occur.

Also, again, if I'm not mistaken, the Weber either does not  have a vacuum  
port for hooking up vacuum advance, or the vacuum  signal that is available 
is  
not compatible with VW vacuum  distributors.  So that would predispose one  
to 
use the  non-vacuum .009 distributor, when installing the Weber.

Dieseling can  be a result of many factors, including avialability of  
fuel/air,  compression ratio, carbon buildup, fuel octane rating, and I'm 
sure  I've  
missed others.

hello Rusty  yes many things can cause this. I have seen progressive  webers 
with the cutoff and the vaccuum ports.  Now many do not have the  cutoff 
solenoids but I think just about all have the vacuum ports. The  number 1 cause I 
have seen has been the throttle not closing all the way.   I have seen a lot of 
these carbs used on many different types of cars in my 28  years of running a 
repair shop.  later  mark dearing   salem  import service  salem va
