Subject: Single notch on the Crank pulley

on one of my 71 buses... there is only 1 notch filed on the "backside" of the
crank pulley.. that year the timing was set to 5 degrees ATDC... Someone told
me that was the notch for the 5 degree timing mark, I assumed it was TDC..

Anyone have a 71 bus with the original pulley and know the truth?

Thanks
