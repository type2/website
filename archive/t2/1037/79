Subject: Deciphering Bus Depot Part #s

[Thought I'd cross-post this from a recent thread on the Syncro List, since
it may be useful to Bus owners as well ....]

That's a pretty good explanation, Mark.  I can add a little more info which
may be useful when searching our site. 

Several common suffixes on our site are X (rebuilt), OR (either aftermarket,
or an alternate OEM brand), EC (economy; almost always aftermarket), MY
(Meyle/Germany brand), BR (Brazilian made), MX (Mexican made), IT (Italian
made), and IN (Indian made).  These "rules" are not necessarily set in
stone, though - for example, a part number may have a BR sufix because at
the time we created the listing the part was made in Brazil, but since then
production has moved.   

If you want to search for all suitable parts, you can eliminate the suffix
and then search by part number itself. For example, searching 211611047F
(late Bus or Vanagon rear wheel cylinder) would bring up a number of options
from $5 to $15 - the plain F (which is German) and four alternates with
suffixes BR, EC, MY, and OR.  All will fit, they are just different brands
and quality levels.  In many cases, our best selling and recommended choice
is noted with a "HOT" icon, so if in doubt go with that.  Typlcally those
are ones where we have obtained a quantity buy from the manufacturer, so you
get the most bang for your buck.  In the above example, that is the plain F,
which is German made for $15. Always remember to click on the product
listing and scroll down to the application guide to make sure the part fits
your vehicle. 

As Mark alluded to, we often use the original VW part number for the Bosch
part, rather than the Bosch part number. The SR401X is a good example - we
use the VW equivalent, which is 025911023AX (the X denoting rebuilt).
However, in many (but not all) cases our site will crossreference this
automatically from the Bosch number.  For example, if you type SR401X into
the part number search box, it will still find the part under the VW number
that we use, even though you typed in the Bosch number.
