> Agree whole heartedly Chris.
> When we rebuilt the engine in our 76 dual carb (Australian  
> versioin) the VW mechanic who did the work for us asked how much we  
> wanted to spend.  We said we wanted a super reliable motor.  Only  
> question after that was whether we wanted to use reconditioned  
> heads or new.  Even a $600.00 each there was no real question.

> Yes it cost us almost $4,000.00 but is totally reliable, starts  
> every time, has good fuel consumption even around town & doesn't  
> miss a beat, now having covered some 25,000 klms.
> Every service is done by the same mechanic (yes, I can do basic  
> maintenance myself but know that it will be tuned correctly & I  
> figure the cost of the tune is negated by the better fuel
> consumption) & he knows to replace anything that needs replacement

> No, we are not wealthy.  We just believe that as Chris said " these

> Like Chris said, a good part will last a long time.  Divide the

> Not living in the USA, I don't buy from the vendors on the list.  I
