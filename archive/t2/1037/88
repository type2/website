Subject: Rear Airshocks for a Bay Westy?

Does anyone know of an air shock or part no. of one that will fit on the 
rear of our Baywindow Westies to allow for some de-sagging of the tired 
torsion bars? I know I should re-index them or replace them, but the sag 
isn't too bad, and it would be nice to be able to have an easier adjustment 
if I decide to haul home some concrete. :-)
Thanks,
Courtney
