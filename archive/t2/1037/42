this is a similar instance to the 36.00 decel elbow. the genuine part  
is available and it is much much better than the POS winders. i agree  
they are a POS, by the way.

this handle costs almost 10x the POS one. but it works and it won't  
break in a year or less.

i have sold 2 of these handles in about 3 years. everyone buys the  
4.00 ones instead.
