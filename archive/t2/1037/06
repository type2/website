Subject: VDO Celsius gauge for oil temp, question

I have a VDO oil temp gauge and the "Taco plate" sender, and on the back of
the gauge, if you read "made in Germany" on the correct horizontal plane, then
the 3 proged attachments below are "top' one,..G for..ground, bottom prong
#144 and "+", and the one that is left over, I cannot decipher.  Is it a "T",
but upside down, or what, and is it to go to the sender?  Thanks.
Syd
