Yeah, I quickly found out when tearing it down that they don't. What I 
did was just clean everything and replace the metal rings on everything. 
I think that solved the leak. The previous owner did a crappy job trying 
to do the same thing, and cylinder #1 wasn't seated properly.
I'm at work so I don't have a manual, but what are the AFM plugs? Thats 
the first time I've heard of that term.
