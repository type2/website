Hey, what do you guys recommend for making sure the push-rod tubes on a 
2000cc T4 are seated? I did a partial rebuild from cylinders #1 & #2, up 
this weekend to repair a blown head gasket on my new bus. But when I 
dumped oil in the motor it just ran out of the push rod tubes. I have 
them in there, but they're still loose so I obviously didn't seat them 
correctly. Is it okay to hold something up that matches the outside edge 
of the tube, such as some PVC pipe and bang on that to seat them? I'm 
afraid it could rip the O-Ring seals going into the case.

Also... The engine would start and run before the rebuild, albeit with a 
bad exhaust leak from the head.... but now the longest I can get it to 
run for is about ten seconds.... did I throw my timing off? I did spin 
the crank by hand via the flywheel when playing around with the 
cylinders, but I'm not sure if that would have done it. I've never 
adjusted timing on a vehicle before.
