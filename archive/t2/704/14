Subject: RE: New Style of thermostat??? What is the deal?

The new style will work. I recently read a thread on the Samba list that
exlains exactly how. The only down side is that when this type of thermostat
goes bad, if fails in the closed position. The old style would expand and
leave the flaps fully open upon failure. From what I read, there are a few
vendors that still have a stash of the old ones, but you'll have to do a
search on the Samba. I've learned more there in two weeks than in the last 12
years. Lots of info, mainly from type 2 list people.
