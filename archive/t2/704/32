are you willing to spend a few dollars, check out your local city bus, you
know the grown up versions of ours.  many transit systems now have bike
racks on the front. these are nice fold up racks that hold two bikes
safely.   now if you are like most bus pilots you don't wanna pay the $$
for a new one, but you might be able to get one from a scrapped bus or
just use it for ideas on how to make your own.
