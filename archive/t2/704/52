Subject: AL75X alternator rebuilt by Bosch

So... the AL75X I got doesn't have the same "shell" as the original.  
It doesn't have a provision for the cooling boot from the fan shroud.  
Should I not even bother installing it and set out on a quest for the 
proper equipment, or is the "new" shell an improved and acceptable 
replacement?

Enquiring minds gotta know.
