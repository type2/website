Subject: Push Rods

Cleaned up my pushrods, tubes and rocker assembly. 
Installed tubes, rods and rocker assembly.  The
problem I'm having is that two of the rocker arms are
bottoming out on the valves before the screws is even
adjusted.  Is that becasue of the stroke of the
engine?  How do you tighten them to spec?  Do I rotate
the engine like a valve adjustment and wait for the
lifter to recede?
