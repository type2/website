Joe,

You don't say (1) how many bikes, (2) what kind of bikes (that is, are 
they spiffy or beaters), or (2) how many passengers there will be in 
your bus.

This answer really only works if the answers are: two, good ones, and 
two.

Put them inside. Get a couple of Yakima-style front-fork hold-downs, 
mount them on a piece of plywood cut to fit somehow, and mount the 
bikes inside. How you would do that depends on whether the interior is 
a camper or a kombi, and so forth.

I don't mind hanging my Raleigh hybrid from the back of my bus. But my 
'69 Carlton goes inside.

Mark
