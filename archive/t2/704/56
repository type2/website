Subject: bus for sale

This ad was in the Daily Oklahoman. 

"1969 Volkswagen Van/Bus, Pop-up Camper , Runs Good, $1000 Call 607- 8164"

I'm assuming that this is area code "405" since the ad didn't list one. This
is not my ad or bus. I'm just passing this along. Although, I might be
selling my '75 trans. soon. I'll try to offer it here first.
