Scott said,"

The new style thermostat is
wax-filled, just like a typical watercooled car thermostat, and they fail in
due time. It will not last forever, that is certain."

   I stand corrected Scott. You are right and proved it by cutting open a new thermostat. When I first saw them on the net I thought it was the spring that did the expanding when heated and contracted when cooled. I had no idea that the unit is waxed filled! Never knew a watercooled one was too. Thanks for the sacrificial thermostat.
