Subject: Re:New Style of thermostat??? What is the deal?

   I also just received one of these thermostats although that is what I 
ordered.
I've gone through several of the stock ones during the last 8 years of 
owning my bus and am willing to try something new. Some modification to 
the bracket (a small hole drilled in the original mount to accept the 
anti rotation tab on the attachment end of the thermostat) will be 
required as well as a way to attach the control cable. As long as the 
thermostat extends and retracts at near the same temps as the bellows 
style I think this new one will last indefinitely. Let us know how you 
get along.
