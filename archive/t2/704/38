Subject: Re: [T2] bikes in front with no spare tire

If you want to add front bolts that do not affect the look of the bus, 
consider bolting through the front grill-  I added  a custom rack made 
from a rear of an old bike frame over the spare tire and used 2 large 
eyebolts (3/8" thread) that go through the third slot from each side of 
the grill, and through the wall by the airscoops to come out just to the 
  side of the airscoops visible under the dash.  Email me for a pic. You 
could design your own rack that rests on the space behind the bumper and 
is anchored to each bolt, with a cross bar anchored to the uprights.  I 
did this in wood to a 71 bus, using its front tire rack mounts- 
horizontal supports are bolted to the crossbar and can be flipped 
sideways when not in use for bikes.
