Subject: Darn near perfect

I did my 20-minute running-in this morning. The engine is running close 
to perfect; the only qualifier is the tinky-tink of at least one lifter 
that hasn't quite pumped up.

What's most remarkable is how good it sounds, given the fact that I 
haven't given the exhaust system any attention at all. Didn't even put 
in new gaskets (that will come later).

No oil leaks.

So in the spirit of the Oscars, I have to thank Dave Bolen, Mark 
Dearing, Richard Atwell, Karl von Salzen, Michael Knight (especially 
for putting me onto the loctite case sealer, along with Scott Lyons), 
Chris M., Stan Wilder, Bob (Access Systems), Jim Hayden, Tom Young, Bob 
Donalds, Phil Trenholme, Phil Cain, Joe from Mitchell Motorworks, Miles 
Erickson, Mike Soultanian, Mike Benthin, Michael Edwards, Librarian, 
Paul A., John Kolak, Jack Stafford, Jack Hattaway, Hal Sullivan, Greg 
Potts, Gerald Livingston, Jason (Faster-Laster), Doyt Echelberger, 
David Bell, Craig K, and Courtney Hook.

Also thanks for comic relief to Tony, Don Tuleja, and Anton Ross.

If I left your name out, I didn't mean to.

Thanks all,

Mark
