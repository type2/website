Aerodynamically speaking, the best option would have to be putting the bikes
inside.  Of the exterior options, I'd suppose that putting them on top would
be by far the worst, rear would probably be best, and front would be somewhere
in between.

I would tend to think that the front might pose an advantage with respect to
handling, since cantilevering bikes off the front end would tend to put more
weight on the front wheels, whereas cantilevering bikes off the back of the
Bus would result in even less weight in front that you had before.

I wonder whether having bikes in front would result in an adverse impact on
the Bus's maximum approach angle, e.g. for ascending a steep and abrupt side
streets and/or driveways?  Buses already have a lot more ground clearance than
most vehicles, so it might not be a problem.
