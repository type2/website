Hello Guys    Greg Potts dad has made it to my shop missing 4th gear  he 
drove up from Flordia to Va, in 3 rd.   Looks like he will need a tranny  82 
aircooled vanagon  what year trannys will work??   Can a late bay tranny be made to 
fit?? the waterboxxer trannys have a diferent shift linkage. Can we just 
change the shift rod??  Does anybody close to Va. have a good used one. Later and 
have fun  Mark Dearing
