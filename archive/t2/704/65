We have both the new style AND the original German VW ones in stock...

<http://busdepot.com/view.jsp?model=8&category=15&group=15&prodgroup=168>

Both fit type 1 engines. The German version can be rather easily adapted to
fit type 4 ('72-up) engines as well. The new style thermostat supposedly can
also be modified for this use (according to a couple of posts on the Samba;
I have not tried it myself) but it involves fabricating a bracket and other
work so it's not as easy.
