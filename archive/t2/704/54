Subject: Dizzy drive gear question

If a dizzy is pulled from an engine that was properly timed at 7.5 degrees and
installed without loosening the clamp, on an engine that had the drive gear
miss installed by 1 tooth, how much should I expect the timing to be off. I'm
trying to figure out a little problem but I don't know how many teeth are on
the drive gear.
