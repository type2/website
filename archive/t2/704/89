Subject: Keep, Sell, Part... I'm in a dilema.

     So I picked up these two great busses in a two for one price deal.  One 
is a 79, apparently CA passenger bus.  The other is a nice 73 camper.  I 
bought them mostly for the camper, because I want to restore it.  I was 
going to sell the 79 to help fund that.
     They both have engines.  The engine in the 73 has a CB code, so I am 
assuming it's a 1700.  It moves but I haven't been able to try to start it 
yet.  The wiring in this is just really bad.  The fuse box is hanging down 
from the dash nested in a ball of wires with five or six alligator clips, 
lamp wire, etc.  Other than that the bus is pretty sweet, very little rust 
at all.
     The 79 has a GE Engine code, which I believe to be correct.  That would 
make it a 2 litre FI engine.  The bus is in really nice shape with the only 
major rust in the battery tray.  I can get the engine started, but it 
doesn't idle.  It revs up really high, then drops down and dies.  I was 
planning to just sell this bus complete, but now I'm wondering if I 
shouldn't just rob the engine AND the wiring harness and just transfer the 
whole dang thing FI and all into the 73.  That would be a pretty sweet set 
up.
      There are downsides though, of course.  I mean, I'd be screwing with 
what appears to be a really nice, mostly complete, CA bus with a good engine 
that I believe actually belongs in the bus.  I'm sure not having and engine 
or wiring would lower the value of that bus to... very little.  It's got 
service records, reciepts, and a bunch of other cool documentation too.  It 
just doesn't seem right.
     I dunno, what would you volks do?  I am thinking I should leave the 79 
as it is and sell it.  That's what I'm really leaning to.  If it brings 
enough, that should fund just buying a new wiring harness and maybe parts 
for an engine rebuild too if it's needed.  Part of that descision, how much 
should the 79 go for (ballpark)?  Minimal rust, 2 litre FI engine, mostly 
complete and decent interior, sliding side windows?

Thanks all, sorry for such a long post!
