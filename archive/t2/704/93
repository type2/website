Subject: last question tonight, FI engine won't idle.

     Okay, this is my last question for the night.  The 79 fuel injected 
engine that I was talking about in the last couple of posts runs (engine 
code GE), but it doesn't idle.  It starts, revs pretty high, then the rpms 
drop and it dies immediately.  I found the Bosch FI manual online and I'm 
going to mess with that this weekend.  I was just wondering if you guys 
could help narrow down my search by giving me a list of likely suspects.  
This will be my first time ever messing with an FI engine.

     I was thinking maybe a vacuum leak and was planning to make that my 
first attack?
