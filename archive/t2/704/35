Sportworks, the company that makes "Bike Racks for Buses," is located in the
Seattle area.  Metro Transit in Seattle sponsored the initial development of
these racks 10+ years ago, and they have since become virtually ubiquitous on
transit buses in the US.  Sportworks.com has info on the product line.  They
do make a lighter-duty non-commercial version as well.

If you happen to find a source for a used rack, I'd sure like to know about
it, as I've considered putting one of these on my Bus but have never taken the
time to find one.  If I recall correctly, they're pretty spendy new... though
perhaps worth it for the convenience, as they are by far the most hassle-free
bike racks ever invented.
