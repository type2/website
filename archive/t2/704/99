My '78 has a GE engine also.  Suggest following
Bentley, or the Bosch FI flow chart.  Some of the
tests are easy, some hard.  
    
A test I don't think they describe?  Finding a vacuum
leak:  (1) Get the engine running (albeit at higher
revs).  (2) Use some spray starter fluid around the
"S" hose, vacuum hoses, brake vacuum one-way-valve,
Throttle body, and around the AFS.  You will know
quickly if you have found a vacuum leak.
    
Proceed step-by-step, as the flow charts suggest. 
Good luck, and keep us apprised of your progress.
