Speaking strictly as an armchair physicist, with no credentials other 
than succumbing to gravity now and then, I'd guess that front-mounted 
bicycles would have little or no measurable effect on the gas mileage. 
Consider that the bus will be loaded down when you travel--it would be 
difficult to say whether any fuel economy decrease was because of 
external drag or the internal load. Plus, it might be that the 
front-mounted bicycles would create some turbulence that would improve 
your slipstream profile, something like the dimples on a golf ball. 
You'd need a wind tunnel to know for certain.

For my money, the front-mounted bolt-on receiver sounds like a dandy 
hack to me.
