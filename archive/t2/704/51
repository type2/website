Thanks for all the suggestions!  The city bus rack link was great, duh! 
  We have them on the busses here in Missoula.  One of their consumer 
racks and a front-mounted receiver hitch is what we're pursuing, and 
I'll let you know how it turns out.  In the meantime, any other ideas 
welcome!

best,
