"I have to disagree strongly with this. The new style thermostat is
wax-filled, just like a typical watercooled car thermostat, and they fail in
due time. It will not last forever, that is certain."

It is true that they will fail eventually, but how often does this happen 
in the analogous situation in water cooled cars?

Another angle could be to treat the thermostat as a regular service item 
that needs to be replaced once every blue moon or so.

Yet another thought is (if your really worried) to set up a switch that 
turns off a small light on the dash when the flaps have fully opened (an 
idiot light?).

Cheers,
