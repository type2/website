I would suspect your airflow meter isn't sending a signal to the double
relay.   Check the plug on the back of the AFM. make sure it is in and
tight,  check your double relay that it is dropping in when the engine
runs.  (check by taking off the air cleaner, turn on ignition to run
position.  slide a pencil eraser first or some similar non metalic object
in to the intake to push the air flow vane inside) as soon as you move the
air flow vane a little bit the double relay should drop in and the fuel
pump run,  if it doesn't it could be a faulty AFM, or faulty Double relay.

do you have the fuel injection troubleshooting flow chart from VW. (it is
in the type 2 library)  follow the flow chart it will rarely steer you
wrong.
