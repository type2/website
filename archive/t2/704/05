Subject: Front door 1/4 windows

Hi All,
I got a few sets of 1/4 windows ages ago from a couple of people which I have
since passed on to friends (Thanks Karl).
They are quite rare here in Australia so not easy to come by, and I have some
one asking me for another set.
So I was wondering if anyone out there has any they'd be willing to package up
and send to Australia for me?
I'd prefer in good condition if possible (bad rust is the main concern).

Thanks for your help,
Richard,
Brisbane Australia
