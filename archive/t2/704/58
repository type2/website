watching jack rayby video on type IV rebuild and he says that he always replaces the camshaft cause you cant always tell if its bad or not...? 

how many folks do this...? 

also he lubes the camshaft with oil as well .....? 
whos right and whos wrong about rebuilds is it just opinions or facts? 
experience and knowledge? 

going to rebuild my 2ltr soon and want it done by the book if there is such a thing...? 

Was Vw's way the right way or have in years past have we learned better things? 

really curious...? 
awesome video by the way... thanks aaron and tony... 
peace 
chris
