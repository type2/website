Subject: Engine question, 79 2000CC w/ Vanagon heads

     By my engine code it looks like I have a 2000CC fuel injected engine 
with Vanagon heads from California.  I know the code sometimes lies, but I 
think in this case it might be accurate.  I was told the bus came from CA, 
it's not as rusted as an East coast bus usually is, the engine letter code 
is GE, and it looks like it's got some of the CA emissions stuff on it 
still.  What's up with the Vanagon heads?  Is that a good thing?
