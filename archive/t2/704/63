Hmmm, I hadn't thought of that.  Any armchair physicists want to rank order
the options in terms of lost aerodynamics?  Would any/all bike mounting
options have noticeable effects on fuel mileage or handling at 55-60?

In the rear (using the Fiamma rack, it appears the bikes woul stick up well
above our standard roofline with no pop top shell), in front, or on top.
Would front-mounting be worse than the roof?  Maybe we'll just have to shuffle
them in and out of the inside

Thanks for all the suggestions!  Oh, and to answer Mark H's questions:  3
bikes (2 nice, but not so nice they'd be thief bait or would worry about paint
chips/bugs) and 2 people.
