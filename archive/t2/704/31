I was talking to a rad shop.. as he was testing a NEW t/stat... and he says his
failure rate is about 75% ..... that is what I was told!
I would be more inclined to have the flaps stay open than install a t/stat like
this one,,, just my opinion tho.

whenever I install a water cooled t/stat... I always put it in boiling water
first,, watch it open,, then I install it..... just to be sure it will work . I
have had tooo many that didn't work right out of the package..
