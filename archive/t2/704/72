Subject: 1600 dual port carb

A friend of mine just joined the air cooled ranks
(yay!) and he has a question I can't answer, since I
have only worked with T4 engines. His is a 1600 dual
port and he is wondering about a replacement
carburetor. It currently has a Solex. Any
recommendations?

Thanks in adveance,
Dave
