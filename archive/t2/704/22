Hello Tim     This isnt always true  I have seen the thermostat bellow so bad 
that it came out off the bracket and closed the flaps .  These dont do this 
very often but it can happen  . You see this sort of stuff if you have been 
working on these as long as I have  later and have fun  Mark Dearing   Salem
