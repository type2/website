Subject: Engine install update

Well, I'm down to what I hope is the last 2 frustrations before I start the
newly rebuilt engine. With the ignition disabled and the spark plugs out, I
turned it over, oops, fuel leak! Checked the leak and found one of the
original clamps (TOO large) must have snuck into my stash of fuel injection
clamps. Replaced the clamp with the correct size, no leaks. Cranked it over
untill the oil pressure light went out. Checked the oil cooler seals that gave
me trouble before. Dry :~) Looked at all the gallery plugs I could see, all
dry. Checked compression, a little low but the engine is stone cold, It's 32
deg. f. outside and this engine hasn't been run under it's own power yet. What
should I have for compression in this situation?? Put the plugs back in and
enabled the ignition. Cranked it over in antisipation of ear to ear smile.
RRRR, RRR,RR,R, click. OOPS. Should have put the battery on to charge
yesterday! Being impatient I charged it for 1/2 hour. Almost enough! Cranked
it over and it almost started. Tried again but cranked slower, almost started
then died. :~P So now the charger is back on while I've cleaned up all the
tools and now I'll get some dinner. I'll try again after about 2 hrs of
charging. Maybe the new battery the P.O. put in didn't handle sitting for over
a year very well! We'll see, if it won't take a charge I think it's still
under warranty (2 year free replacement)
