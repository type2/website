Subject: Aircooled Mechanic in or around Buffalo, NY?

Does anyone know a good air cooled mechanic in the
Buffalo, NY area.  I need fuel injection service and
ideally a torsion bar adjustment.  I am accepting
defeat and want to have a professional make an attempt
to fix my Westy's fuel injection before I rip the
stock fuel injection off and go with a carb setup. 
Thanks!
