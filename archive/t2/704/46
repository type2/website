Subject: EveryBus 2005 Important update

One more time with details!

Please visit the web site at http://www.mindspring.com/~everybus/

There are three important updates.

1) Revised fee structure. Campground fees will be $16 per vehicle per
night. Additionally,  there will be a $5 event charge per registration.
For example. You and your family show up in the bus on Friday and leave
Sunday. That will be $32 campground fee plus $5 for the event charge.
The total in this case would be $37.

2) The 2005 t-shirt design is in and it's yet another winner from Poor
Richard!

3) The first round of updates of the carabus page are in. Check them
out. If you are planning on coming please e-mail me and I will add you
to the list.

Thanks
Chris
