Most of the headlight switches sold for Busses are Chinese knockoffs that
are just plain wrong for U.S. spec Busses. They don't have the proper
terminals, and in some cases don't even physically fit the dash correctly.
The only correct ones that I have seen (and the only ones that I sell) are
the genuine VW ones and the repros from Ventura.
