Hey, Don't give up on the stock system!  If you go the carb route, I'm 
interested in the stock setup, as my daughter uses a 75 FI bus.  She had 
a stalling problem when idling and couldn't find the air leak- since she 
is in Savannah now at art school, I couldn't help her, so on the 
internet looked up Porsche specialists/repair shops- she took it there 
and they found the hidden leak in the connecting rubber sleeves for the 
intake manifolds to airbox.   The system is virtually the same as a 914 
and they are familiar with all the parts and how to check them. 
Downside was the labor to remove the manifolds to replace all the sleeves.
Re torsion bar adj, I went to Goodyear Tire with the Bentley manual (for 
the specs) and they aligned it.
