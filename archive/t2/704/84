Subject: Re: [T2] 1600 dual port carb

I ordered the Bocar 34PICT3 from aircooled.net for my '71 last year, and it's
been great.  It's my second new carb, though -- my first attempt at replacing
the old carb was a Brazilian model.  It decided to quit idling, period,
regardless of screw settings, less than 2 yrs after I bought it.  Haven't
tried taking it apart yet to find out what went wrong.
