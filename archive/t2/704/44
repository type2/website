Subject: '73 dash wiring photos

Does anyone have photos of all the wires under the dash of a '73 or so --
done neatly/correctly?

Looks like I'm going to have to completely unwire everything and trace all
the wires back looking for "skinned spots" left by the PO's hack job.

http://www.phorce1.com/dash/

Here's what I've had happen so far:

1. Started with no idiot lights, no headlights, no turn signals, no wipers
-- 4 way flashers worked OK

2. Found the "X" terminal wasn't attached at the ignition switch -- got
headlights and wipers - still no idiot lights or turn signals

3. Pulled the gauge cluster out -- suddenly the oil idiot light started
working, sometimes...

4. tried the turn signals -- the oil idiot light stopped working and won't
work again -- may have also happened when I shifted the position of the
gauge cluster rather than having something to do with the turn signal
attempt.

Now, when I turn on the 4-way flasher it flashes the lights outside OK but
inside it flashes the oil idiot light and the fuel gauge "bounces" <sigh>.

I've shifted the position of the gauge cluster several times so I think
there are bare wires under there touching each other at random.

I did check all the grounds that go to the gauge cluster -- good and tight
and provide a good BRIGHT light when tested at the cluster with a test
lamp.

So, now I'm at the point that I will be pulling all the wires loose under
the dash. Taping or shrink-wrapping any bare spots. Wire strapping
everything back into "neatness", etc., etc., etc.

Be nice to have some pictures of one that's done <grin>.
