Subject: tranny question regarding diesel

So I know that not all trannys are compatable with the diesel engines, and 
that some have to be regeared.  Does anybody know if the automatic (the 
later model in a 79) is compatable with a 1.6 with turbo, or a 1.9?  If not 
can it be modified to be, or what would be the best tranny to get?
Thanks,
Kyle
