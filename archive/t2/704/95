If you were in Colorado I'd say to give the 79 to me. ;) I still need
a vehicle for the wife...

Seriously, if you want the 73, take the engine and FI from the 79 and
put 'em in the 73. Tranny too.

Troubleshooting that FI will probably be easy. Sounds like vacuum
leaks or ignition. Neither are too difficult to repair. Though
sometimes finding vacuum leaks is an adventure...
