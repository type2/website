I have just made a reciever hitch for the front of the 73-79 bus,,, may fit
other years,, I haven't tried to fit it to others yet.

It bolts to the tow loops underneath,, then allows you to put in ANY style hitch
accessory... like a bike carrier... or a spare tire holder.... or even a ball to
put the boat trailer into the lake with out putting your engine under water....

Along the idea of this picture...
