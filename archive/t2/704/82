Kyle,

I looked at the gearing for early and late bay trannies and what you 
*really* want is to take a late bay tranny and put an 0.82 or 0.77 4th 
gear in it.  Either that, or put a 4.57 r&p into an early bay tranny that 
has the 0.82.

there's some discussion here:

Not really sure about automatics though.

Cheers,
