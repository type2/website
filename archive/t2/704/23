I have to disagree strongly with this. The new style thermostat is
wax-filled, just like a typical watercooled car thermostat, and they fail in
due time. It will not last forever, that is certain.

I will also re-iterate that the danger with this style of thermostat is that
they fail closed. This could easily damage or even destroy and engine in
summer weather. If the wax leaks out or stops expanding enough to push the
plunger out of the thermostat body, the heavy spring keeps the flaps closed.
The purpose of the spring on the new thermostat is to retract the thermostat
back to closed position and it is very strong.
