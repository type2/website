Mike,

Your signature suggests that you do a lot of long-distance driving.  If that's
the case, then the amount of damage per mile done by long cold starts with
flaps open might be far less significant for you.

Someone who makes multiple relatively short trips each day will be doing a lot
more damage with so much cold running.  If someone's trip to work takes 20
minutes, and an engine without a thermostat takes 10 minutes to reach normal
operating temperature instead of 5 minutes, that's an awful lot of extra
cold-start damage per mile driven.

Wheras if you start your engine and it takes 10 minutes to reach normal
operating temperature, but then you proceed to drive for ten hours straight at
highway speeds across an entire state (or seven miniature Northeastern
states!), the lack of a thermostat will have done you very little harm
relative to the mileage that you've driven.

Cheers,

- Miles
