Subject: bikes in front with no spare tire

Hi again,

Thanks all for the help in getting us ready for our summer in the bus!  Our
next project is figuring out how to take our bikes along in this '78 (no
pop-top).  I've scoured the archives but come up mostly empty on front-mounted
racks which don't make use of a front-mounted spare.

The front seems the most logical place on a bus to us.  Rear blocks access.
Roof is mighty high (and probably wouldn't help fuel mileage!).  Inside the
bus takes too much space.

I hate to drill the nose, but if that would help, it's an option.  I could
imagine vertical bars up from the bumper with arms extending out front to hold
the bikes, but this would require something to balance out the pull from the
bikes cantilevered out there.  Any clever solutions or ideas?  I can keep
coming up with dumb ones on my own ;-)

cheers,
joe broach
