Subject: Re: [T2] Re:New Style of thermostat??? What is the deal?

Any chance of actuating the flapper rod with this thermostat in a different way so when it fails the flappers are open? I have not seen it installed. 

Any way of repairing the OEM style thermostat? How do they usually fail? Crack in flexible seam?
