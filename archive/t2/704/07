Subject: Re: '78 timing questions

I wonder if this archived post partially answers my question:

I set timing per instructions with vac hose disconnected and plugged, but I
checked total advance with the vac hose connected!  I'll check again with just
the mech advance and see what happens.

I still welcome your thoughts, though!
