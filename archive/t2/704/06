Subject: '78 timing questions

Well, I finally found a tach/dwell meter cheap and got to play with a timing
light for the first time after years of static timing engines.

As usual, I'm puzzled.  I set the dwell to 50 degrees via the point gap, the
engine was warm and idling at 900.

The distributer is a new (less than 10k miles) unit spec'ed for a 1974 Beetle
(043 905 205).  It is single vacuum dual advance.  According to oldvolkshome's
handy chart, the timing specs are nearly identical to my bus's stock
distributer (base and total advance).

First question:  Using the timing light, the setting bounced around a little
at idle as I watched.  I would estimate this to be +/- 1 degree and erratic,
not smooth, around the 7.5 degree mark.  There is no discernible wobble in the
shaft, and dwell stays constant as engine is revved.  Normal?  Acceptable?

Second question:  Revving the engine toward 3000, the advance steadily climbed
to just over 40 degrees BTDC!  This seems an unacceptable amount of advance
(32.5 degrees or more from the base 7.5 BTDC setting).  This is too much, yes?
Should I then retard the base setting, ignoring the spec of 7.5 for both dizzy
and engine?  What's an acceptable figure?

Third question: the Sun Actron Engine Analyzer (CP7676 I think) was a bit
weird.  The intruction sheet said to ground the black lead and hook the red
lead to the points side of the coil (negative side).  When I did this the tach
reading bounced around too much to be useful.  Unhooking the black lead and
just letting it dangle gave acceptable readings.  Is something flaky or is
this normal?  Dwell was correct with the black lead grounded.

thanks all,
