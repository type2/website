Subject: Re: AL75X alternator rebuilt by Bosch

I said:

So... the AL75X I got doesn't have the same "shell" as the original.  
It doesn't have a provision for the cooling boot from the fan shroud.  
Should I not even bother installing it and set out on a quest for the 
proper equipment, or is the "new" shell an improved and acceptable 
replacement?

then Scott Lyons said:

I think you need the sheet metal cover for the rear of the assembly. 
The AL75 cooling boot is attached to the sheet metal cover, not the 
alternator itself. The cover is not supplied with a rebuilt alternator, 
you re-use your old one.

To which I say, after double-checking my situation and snapping a 
couple of pictures:

I'll never profess to know the complete history of my bus, but I do 
know the engine I pulled had a VWoC rebuilt sticker.  I haven't been 
able to find any markings on the alternator, so I don't even know if 
I'm working from stock... but this one didn't have a piece of 
sheetmetal on the back.  The air cooling vent is built into the cast 
case.  If all I need for my replacement alternator is a piece of tin, 
I'll start scavenging.  I see what Scott was talking about on the 
microfiche.   Maybe it's possible (if not a PITA) to disassemble the 
two alternators and swap out the cast backs?
