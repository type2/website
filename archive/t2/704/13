Subject: New Style of thermostat??? What is the deal?

Hello List,

I recently ordered a thermostat for my 16oocc DP
emgine from the bus depot. It does not even resemble
the origional unit. Instead of resembling a acordian,
it looks more like a cylinder with a coil around it.
Has anyone used one of these? Is there anything I
should know about them? I just want to make sure this
thing is going to work before I trust it on my new
engine. the part number is:

111 119 159A

Is this the correct part number? Thanks for any
advise!

Regards,
