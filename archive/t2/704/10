Where exactly did you ground the black lead? If you're grounding at
the battery and getting these readings try grounding to the case
instead. And the other way around too...

May be a sign of poor grounding of the case and trans. 

I time with vacuum connected, per Bentley. 7.5 at idle gets me 40-ish
at 3k rpm which is what I'm looking for...
