Thank goodness for bus depot helping to tear down the wall between us and Thermostadt.

I recently found a place that had five Type 4 thermostats forsale for $50 ea but I only managed to get one before the rest sold. It's still a very hard to find that item at reasonable prices but it goes to show there are still some on the shelves out there.

If only Wahler could do a small production run.
