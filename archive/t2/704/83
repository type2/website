Subject: New Style of thermostat- it dosn't seem to work...

Hello,

I bought the new style thermostat from the Bus Depot.
Curious about how and if this thing worked, I wanted
to test it. I sat it on top of the toaster and turned
it on until the thermostat became too hot to touch. I
measured the length of it. I then put it in the
freezer for a few minutes until it was cold to the
touch. I measured it and it was the same length. Am I
missing somthing here? I don't think it works. What do
you think. I paid almost $40. for it... Any
suggestions? I just want to make sure that it is
faulty before I try to send it back. Did I not do
somthing right? I am leary about bolting this thing to
my new engine.

Thanks!

Regards,
