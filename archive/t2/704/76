To which I reply:  The distortion is from the fancy close-up angle- the 
hole is round as can be.  So, I guess I had a 70 amp AL108 (now testing 
dead).

And I'll add, for the sake of completeness, this picture of the rear of 
my new alternator (as mounted in the fan shroud):

Does this resemble the 55 amp AL75 (sans cooling tin)?


BTW, the front of my old one looks nothing like the pic on Bus Depot's 
site for the AL108:
