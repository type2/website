Subject: Re: [T2] Wiring issues on my 1974 westy

Before you go ahead and throw out the alternator, make sure it is not
just 
a shorted wiring harness to the cover plate.  Look for arcing marks on
the 
inside of the cover over the posts.  
I make an insulator piece out of the bottom of a round plastic bottle
(washer fluid, cleaner,
clorox etc) sliced out about a half inch from the bottom, cut in half or
a little more to fit 
between the cover and the posts.  You should do this, especially after
replacing the harness.
It is just extra piece of mind.

By the way... off subject, I'm off to Haiti in 10 days for another two
weeks of work.  Watch for
a possible sale of my Type 2 if I get a contract position that would put
me there for a year.  My 
wife says if i get the job, I have to reduce my home fleet.

My bus is a 1975 Riv, with running gear from a 78.  Lots of new parts,
little rust and a good driver.
The only somewhat major issue that is on hold is a transaxle mainshaft
bearing that just started to 
sing, and that will need to be addressed at some point.
