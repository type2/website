Hey Eron,

 

I would check with Steve Sandlin - http://www.steveslockshop.com/.

 

I have heard he is one of the best VW locksmiths.there is also a guy named
Gabe-down in Texas, I can't find his info right now-check thesamba, he
always has odd key-related stuff for sale. He is also supposed to be
excellent.

 

Good luck.
