Hi Volks,

It's almost that time of year again, now that the holidays are past and 
cabin fever sets in... Well, we are serving up the antidote on February 
19th, 2010. Bring your daily driver, or call your classic out of 
hibernation for a great weekend of VW camping.

If you really hate mosquitoes, then this is the weekend for to get your 
revenge, and enjoy a campout without using the repellent even once!

The cost to camp is $34/night. Unfortunately we will no longer be 
allowed to split the cost of sites between two vehicles, but we will be 
allowed to share sites to keep the group closer together.

Please let me know if you are planning on attending, so I can make sure 
the campground has enough sites plowed out for everybody. And bring 
firewood if possible... we keep the campfire going all day long at TCWBC.

Visit the website for all the gory details...
