Subject: Oh Dear, HF is now in Bellingham

Oh dear fellow Canucks and PNW'ers; HarborFreight has opened in Bellingham as of the 22nd. Those lineups at the border of Canucks heading south just doubled. :-) LOTS of nice disposable tools to play on our Westies with! 10 dollar side grinder, 4.99 float charger. There goes my retirement nest egg. :-)
