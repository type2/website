Subject: Wiring issues on my 1974 Westy

Hey guys, I have a short in my wiring system and I cannot figure out where the
drain on my battery is coming from. It is not a large voltage loss, but It
does drain the battery.  I have taken the ground cable off and pulled one fuse
at a time and dragged the ground across the negative post on the battery and
it sparks after i take each fuse out on the fuse panel.  I cannot figure it
out.  Any help would be good.
