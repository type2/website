Subject: Few questions after a long road trip

1978 FI Auto.
I recently returned from a 1200 mile road trip down to Florida to watch a bowl
game.  This was my bus' first real test after getting her on the road about a
year ago.  She ran great for the most part but we had a couple issues that I
have questions about.

At one point she started knocking like I was running on 3 cylinders.  Pulled
over and found the #4 spark plug laying on the engine.  Threads were not
stripped and it screwed right back in with no problem, so I guess it just
unscrewed itself?  The last time I had that plug out was for a compression
test maybe 2000 miles ago.  Should I chalk that up to me not putting it in
tight enough or is that something I should be worried about?

2nd - I have a fused hot start relay installed and about half way through the
trip it started blowing that fuse whenever I tried to start her up.  I used
the screwdriver deal on the starter and it started up 5 or 6 times after that,
but after stopping for lunch on the way home jumping the starter did nothing.
Best I can tell my solenoid was no good, but when I took it apart everything
moved freely enough.  When I bought the bus the starter in it had the exact
same problem, it would spin ok but would not engage.  I replaced it with what
I thought was a nice new Bosch starter (both starter and solenoid were new),
should a solenoid go bad after a couple of years and about 6000 miles?  Could
there be anything I have setup wrong to cause a solenoid to stick or go bad
that quick?  And lastly, can I replace just the solenoid on the old unit so I
can use that one as a spare?

As always, TIA,
chandler
