Way back when - I sold parts at Advance Auto. Second job helping us save 
up for our first house. They had a line of rebuilt starters and 
alternators where the rebuild company would take a pile of starters and 
tear them down. They would toss the worn out parts and build starters 
from the remaining so-so parts. I can't remember if there were any new 
parts installed. I know these were cheap and that fit the needs of some 
customers well. There was a better line that had some new parts and then 
of course the "good (new) stuff".

Several times I have owned multiple VWs at a time and did this same 
thing. Had a pair of Super Beetles in Italy and after a month I had 
taken the best of both and built one good car that I drove for three 
years. The problem was that I had a hard time predicting when that old 
part would give up and need replacement. I did a clutch job in a parking 
lot in Pisa, Italy once for this reason.
