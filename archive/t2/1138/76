Subject: re:need another windshield

I just went through a long search for glass on my driver's side door. But
during it, I found windshield glass readily available-ie most glass shops in
the area could get it. I'm not sure the insurance situation in CA, but in MA
if you have comprehensive insurance, windshields-and I think all glass is
covered for free by insurance-no deductible. I'm not sure the logic behind
it.

 

I hope that helps.I can't comment on the vwparts glass.I think a lot of the
windshield stuff is made by only one or two manufacturers, so not much
difference in quality, but I could be wrong.
