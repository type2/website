Subject: Push Rod tube replacement

Happy New Year All!
Looks like one of the pushrod tubes on Mrs. Baker's 70 Westy took a shot from piece of road debris or something and got munched, it is cracked with a big oil leak.

Please refresh my memory, can you replace a push rod tube on a Type 1 engine without removing the head??  I seem to remember that you can use some kind of spring-loaded push rod tube to do this, but I have never done it that way.  Please advise...

PEACE! 
John Baker
