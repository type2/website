I'm pretty sure the gearbox number will start with 091, and I'm not sure how to decipher the rest of the numbers.  You could find out which engine your bus was originally equipped with by looking at the M-codes, or you could jack up the rear end, put it in 4th gear and turn the engine over while watching the wheels.  If the engine turns about 4 times per wheel revolution (i.e. both wheels turn one revolution, mark them to make sure) then you have the 4.57 ring and pinion.  If the engine turns about 4-3/4 times per wheel revolution (and I suspect it will) then you have the 5.43 R&P.

Depends on what you want out of your bus.  If you like having gears 1-3 be very low, with a relatively large gap between 3 and 4, then you could swap out your .889 4th gear for a .82 or .77.  If you don't mind taller 1-3 gears, then you could swap your tranny for one with the 4.57 R&P or perhaps just swap out your current R&P.

Around here it would be somewhat easier and cheaper to swap the whole gearbox, but they are relatively easy to find here in the States.  Might be different where you are.

I definitely wouldn't worry about it until you make that decision.

Yeah, that's pretty expensive.  I would not be driving my bus much with those figures.  Your mileage does seem about 25% below what it should be though, and I seriously doubt much of that is due to the gearing.  More likely tuning/carb issue or maybe you just have a lead foot.  :-)
