Subject: FS Type IV Baby Dellortos FRD

I've had a couple folks express interest, but I still have them....

I have a pair of baby Dells on type IV/914/912E manifolds. Manifolds,  
carbs, linkage and K&N (type?) air cleaners. Claude's Buggies IIRC.  
Reasonably clean, but they've been sitting for a while and probably  
ought to be gone through. Special to a listmember, $200+shipping for  
the pile. TheSamba prices seem to be $250-400 for the same carb setup.

What ya see is what ya get.
