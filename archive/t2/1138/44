Subject: Hot Start Relay

After 40+ years of use, my ignition-to-starter solenoid wire just doesn't cut
it anymore.  After years of using the hammer trick at gas stations and
restaurants, I decided to do what I knew I should have done years ago.  I went
ahead and put a hot-start relay in my engine bay.  Rather than use the SPDT
off-the-shelf relays that you can buy off the shelf though, I tried something
a little more robust and economical.  I bought myself a lawn-mower/small
tractor starter solenoid from Sears.  They are also available off-the-shelf at
Lowe's and Home Depot.  It cost me $6.  It simply mounted to the bracket I
have already used to mount my third brake light relay; the old voltage
regulator bracket(which is no longer there due to internally-regulated
alternator) via an existing mounting hole. Two screw terminals and a
jumper(included) to the mounting screw for ground later, and I was in
business.  It has been rock solid.  It took me about 20 minutes to install,
and I wish I had done it a LONG time ago.
