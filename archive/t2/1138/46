Subject: 82 vanagon problem with the shifter.

 I have an 82 vanagon that usually runs great and now I am having a problem
with getting her to allow me to shift through the gears. It feels like a
mechanical issue in the shifter linkage. I took her to get fixed and she ran
great for about 5 miles and then the same issue again when I try to put her
into third I cannot and I have to feel around for another gear. My mechanic
thinks that my motor mounts might be loose and that is why this is happening.
Does this sound correct?
Thank you, David
