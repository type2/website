That's a tough one. Pretty much have to work the mechanism in your
hand to try to discover why it will throw manually but not with the
solenoid.

 inside and out.  I can freely move the parts around, but when hooked up to
 power on the bench it would only spin and *try* to engage but would not
 shoot out more than a 1/4" or so.  I'm not sure what that means but I have
 read that the solenoids were pretty much bullet proof, yet I've seen 2
 seemingly bad ones in 2 years.  Makes me think I have something wrong in the
 setup that might be causing it.
