engine should have sounded a lot worse than knocking but if it doesn't 
happen again I would just write it off.

sounds like you got a bad starter, theres beeen a lot of that going round 
especially with the auto starters.

it's gotten so bad that lately I've been carrying a spare starter with me 
when I travel.   can't push start an auto tranny bus.

also check to make sure you are using the right size fuse in the starter 
relay too.
