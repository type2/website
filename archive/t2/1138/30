I found  the wiring issue on my 74 westy. It is in the alternator.  When  I
disconnected it from the voltage regulator, it quit sparking at the  battery
post.  I'm not quite sure what to so with the  alternator.  I think the 
diodes
are bad.  Looks like I need a new  wiring harness for the alternator to the
requlator as well.  Does  anyone have any advice?

plate/  then take it and have it tested  later  mark  d
