What you describe is an autozone rebuild perhaps better!!
I did the same thing to the starter in my 78 ten years ago and the current
owner just replaced it. It was one of those times were it was just until I
could get another one and it worked so well I never did replace it.  Hope
everyone had a great holiday. Getting ready for blizzard conditions myself
right now.
