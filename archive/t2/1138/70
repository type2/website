Mike -

Give a call to Bill & Steve's Foreign, located on Bellflower Blvd in
Downey, just north of the I-105 Frwy.  I'm sure Steve has a Windshield
(and new seal) in stock or can get quick for you at an affordable
price. Tell Steve I sent ya.

562-923-3251

Or you could go to Buses By The Bridge in Lake Havasu this weekend and
probably pick up a good used :)
