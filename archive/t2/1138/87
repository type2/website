Type 2a Bus, 1776cc, dual 36mm Dellortos, "034" SVDA, bosch blue coil. Timing
set a 7.5 degrees BTDC.

This bus RUNS extremely well with points. Idles good, acceleration is good,
off-load compression is good with no backfire.

Drop in a Compu-fire or Pertronix and it won't accelerate under load and idles
erratically.

I have tested two distributors, 5 different coils of varying voltage, 3 points
replacement modules with the same result.
