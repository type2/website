David,

Thanks for the info!

No, I have not verified my speed.
My Speedo is graduated in km/h so I'm using a little under 100 km/h as 60 mph.
Coming in to work this morningIt's probably more around 3,800 for 60mph.  Still 
high RPM as you suggest.
My '76 was originally from Spain.  I am not sure if this is the original 
engine/gearbox combo.
I'm running stock-sized tires.  I'll have to check the number on the gearbox (or 
transaxle?).
However, I'm not sure where those numbers live.

You mentioned suggesting a replacement gearbox.  Would it make any sense to swap 
out my current 4th gear for a taller one?
Or would the cost/time of rebuilding my current gearbox be uneconomical in 
comparison?
Note that, this is just for curiosity as we might be selling our lovely camper 
in a month or so for a Westy.

Just a side note about economy.
My latest figures show me getting about 14 miles per US gallon.
The average petrol price in the UK is about 1.27 GBP per litre.
Doing the math shows about 7.45 USD per gallon.
That's about 50 cents a mile.  Ouch.
