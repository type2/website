Subject: Engine Speed: Limits and Efficiency

Happy New Year!

Thank you everyone for answering my previous query for tips on sealing up the 
bus from winter weather.

I'm sure this topic has been covered before, but I had some questions regarding 
engine speed.
These are general questions, but I'll use by engine for examples.

My bus is a '76 with an 1800cc Type IV engine (engine code AP).

What RPM should I keep above to prevent lugging the engine?
Similarly, what engine speed should I not exceed?

The Idiots book says 2,000 to 5,000.  However, I thought that the Type IV engine 
might have a bit more
flexibility for low RPM in low gears.


Also, the Haynes manual says my engine produces peak torque at 3,000 RPM and 
peak power at 4,200 RPM.
Does that mean I'll get the best top gear cruising efficiency at about 4,200 
RPM?
I hit 60mph around 3,900.
When cruising around town at lower gears should I stay around 3,000 RPM (speed 
limits notwithstanding) for efficiency?

Also, when shifting for best acceleration (not necessarily flooring the gas 
pedal) should I remain in gear until peak power before shifting up?

In general, I try to be easy on the engine and gears, but I was just curious.

Thanks,

Josh
