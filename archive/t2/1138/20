Subject: Re: [T2] doing a compression test on a fuel injected engine

Hello All! I have a friend here in Hawaii with a 1980 Vanagon, 2.0 liter fuel
injected. It is using huge amounts of gas and missing on one cylinder. She's
thinking of switching to a dual carb setup, but before we tear into it, I need
to do a compression test. I know how to disable the ignition by pulling the
hot wire to the distributor. How do I keep the injectors from working while
doing the test? Thanks again
