Subject: Vanagon heater cable question

This is about aircooled -- 1982 Vanagon,

The connections to my flappers are all kinds of wrong. I've read Sean  
Bartnik's write-up, I've looked at ETKA, and I've read Bentley. Still  
don't know how to put these together correctly or what I need to get.  
So here's the set of questions:

First: There are welded brackets on both sides. Currently, on my left  
side, the gas return line is routed through a grommet in the flapper  
end of the bracket. I assume that's not correct, but who knows?

Second, only the right side has the full schmeer of boot, spring,  
bushing, etc. ETKA shows this on the left side only, and Bentley is  
ambiguous. Should both sides have the complete boot, spring, bushing,  
etc. assembly?

Third, does the assembly mentioned above - on p. 80.4 of Bentley -  
route through both ends of the welded bracket? Does the boot fit  
between the bracket ends, or to the rear of the rear end?

Fourth, where does the small spring fit into all of this?

Thanks

Mark
