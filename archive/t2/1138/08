Hook up a voltmeter to the battery and watch the voltage while cranking-
the FI needs a minimum of 9 (?) volts while the starter is drawing its
current.  Look at the spark while cranking with your battery vs when
jumped- is there a difference in spark intensity (blue/white vs a weak
orange, and how far a gap can it jump?
