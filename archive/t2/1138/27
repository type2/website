Subject: Wiring issues on my 1974 westy

I found the wiring issue on my 74 westy. It is in the alternator.  When I
disconnected it from the voltage regulator, it quit sparking at the battery
post.  I'm not quite sure what to so with the alternator.  I think the diodes
are bad.  Looks like I need a new wiring harness for the alternator to the
requlator as well.  Does anyone have any advice?
