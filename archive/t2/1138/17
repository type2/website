Subject: Karl von Salzen?

I just noticed the "in memory of Karl Von Salzen" at the top of  
Atwell's website. I've been away for a couple years and ... well, I'm  
hoping that this is just a reminder that we should remember Karl from  
time to time, even though he's alive and well? And still sifting  
through junkyards and answering questions?
