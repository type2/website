Subject: [T2] Karl von Salzen?

I just noticed the "in memory of Karl Von Salzen" at the top of Atwell's 
website. I've been away for a couple years and ... well, I'm hoping that this is 
just a reminder that we should remember Karl from time to time, even though he's 
alive and well? And still sifting through junkyards and answering questions?

Unfortunately that is not the case.
