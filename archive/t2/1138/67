Subject: need another windshield

Hey Everyone,
My windshield cracked and I'm in need of another one.  Does anyone know 
where I can pick one up?  I'm in Southern California, Long Beach, to be 
exact.  It doesn't have to be new, either.  Oddly enough, when I looked 
up windshield on thesamba, nothing came up...

Thanks!
Mike
