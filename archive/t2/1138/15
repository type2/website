Subject: Front door glass

I painted my 74 westy and took all the glass out.  I now am installing new
seals and scrapers, but am having trouble with the front door glass. Could
someone walk me through the order I need to follow for installation.  I'm
having trouble getting the glass back in.  It been so long since I took it
out, can't remember how I took it out.

Thanks for the help,
