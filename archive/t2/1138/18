Okay, I have one good heater cable and one good flapper valve, both on  
the right side of my 82 aircooled van. I'll be scrubbing the boneyards  
for the missing parts, but in the meantime I'll be wanting some heat.

As luck would have it, I live in So. Cal., so I don't need a lot of  
heat, but I need some to the defroster and some just because I'm  
getting old.

Somehow I have to cap off the heater ducting in front of where the  
left bellows would attach because I haven't got a flapper over there.  
That's trivial.

The non-trivial part of this work around is that I need to block some  
of the air going from the alternator-mounted fan over to the left heat  
exchanger.

- I don't want to block all of it, because that would lower the  
effectiveness of the working exchanger, on the right, because all the  
air from the fan would be passing over it.

- I don't want to spill all the air, because that would lower the flow  
through the right half of the system too much.

So: how much should I block? And any good ideas about how to do it?  
some kind of a baffle?

Thanks,

Mark
