Subject: Re: [T2] Weak Starter?

  Sorry, FI--should have mentioned that.   I should have also mentioned 
that when I jump start the car from a running vehicle, the starter turns 
over quickly and the van starts within a few seconds.  The reason I 
initially ruled out a fuel problem was that the starter seemed to be 
cranking slow--the same way it would if the battery was run down.
