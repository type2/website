Oh thank goodness!

Joel found an obit for Joe Clark and....

We'll screw it into the WetWesties site where it will (hopefully) live 
forever. It will be a really good home for tent info!

Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!!!!!

Please do me a favor....  Don't die.

I am so relieved!

Jim

Hi Jim - thanks for the offer to host. I changed ISPs and haven't had a
chance to re-establish the site but it might be easier just to put the
files on your server. They are woefully in need of a redesign & update,
but I guess a lot of that historical info doesn't change much. I'll zip
it all up this evening & send your way, and will leave a pointer at the
old address to forward people to the new location once it's set up.

Thanks again!
Joe
