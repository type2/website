Subject: Where'd the tent page go?

Houston. We have a problem.


Where'd Joe Clark's tent page go????

This: http://www.nettally.com/jclark/vw/
points to this: http://jsclarkfl.blogspot.com/vw/index.html
which says jsclark don't exist.

Noooooooooo!!!!!!!!

All other Google results lead to dead ends.

Anyone have any idea?

I put it to Unca Joel and he found an obit from Sept 13, 2010. I hope not.

Did anyone happen to archive the site? (Which we ought to do for Hoover's blog
as well.)

Speaking of Hoover, does anyone happen to know his wife's name and e-addy?
