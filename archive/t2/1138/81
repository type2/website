Subject: [VB] Front brake drums rubbing on springs?

Hi everybody,
I have a 63 bus (small drums)and I replaced the front brake shoes and ever since there is squeel sound when driving. Sometimes it stops when braking. Sometimes I have to get it up to 35 mph to hear it, sometimes just barely moving. It gets really bad if I drive it for a long distance (which I don't do anymore). I've had this bus for 22 years now and have done a few brake jobs on it and never experienced this. When I remove the drums it appears like the the center part of the drum is rubbing on the springs. I've tried switching the top spring with the bottom, swapping the shoes and can't figure it out. It's like the drum goes on too far now. Has this ever happened to anyone else?
Thanks
Mike Jones
