If nothing else works - - - tear the starter down and check the brushes 
and bushings. If they are worn the moving parts of the starter can rub 
against the inside of the starter motor housing and drag... Bushings and 
brushes are cheap and easy to install. Add some fresh grease and new 
paint and you're approaching a rebuilt starter.
