Haha.  Yes, I that was the plan, but my last remark was intended to be a 
tongue-in-cheek statement on my instrumentation fetishism.

I'll probably leave the tach where it is and get a new one for the new vehicle.

What I'm wondering is:  In terms of functionality, is there much a difference 
from a nice VDOtach versus some other cheap unit?
It's just measuring spark count off the coil so I figure there can't be much 
difference in accuracy.  
I'm not really worried about aesthetics either.
Or am I wrong and is something in the VDO range worth the money?

so snatch the one you have while you still have it, and make sure to document 
how to put it on the new bus
