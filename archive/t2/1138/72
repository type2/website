Like I've said for years, Safelite always a reasonable choice.  Back in the
day 10-12 years ago they still only wanted $99-109 installed depending on
market (they'd give you a whopping $10 off to install yourself.)  I think the
last time we had this discussion someone mentioned they were up to over $220
as well.  Bob, what did it set you back recently?
