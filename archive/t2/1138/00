Subject: Weak Starter?

  I've had a problem with my '79 transporter for more than a year now.  
When running it runs beautifully.  Problem is starting--the starter 
turns the engine over but often (especially after many small trips) the 
engine turns over forever before starting.  I sometimes have to spray a 
bit of starting fluid in the air intake.

I put in one of those "hard starting relays".  Same problem.  New 
plugs....timing seems fine.  Pertronix electronic points.  New 
Battery...actually two batteries running with a smart battery switch 
(isolator).

Voltage at the battery was 13.25 volts with the engine on yesterday.  
That leads me to believe the alternator is OK.  The only conclusion I 
can come to is that either the starter has had its day or there are 
dirty connections somewhere.  Is there something else I should check 
before pulling the starter?

Any help appreciated,

Adrian
