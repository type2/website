It's time to bust out the Bentley wiring diagram and follow the wires 
from the battery and see where they go.  If you pull out all of the 
fuses, then that will help you isolate a lot of the traces on the 
diagram.  If you still can't find anything after that, then try looking 
for any extra wires that were added on, or even stuff like aux battery 
wires (if you have that setup.  I would have only the bone-stock wiring 
hooked up and disconnect anything that isn't in the diagram.  Then keep 
testing and I'm sure you'll find that little bugger....
