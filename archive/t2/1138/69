Hi Mike,

I would expect that you could probably get that from the closest local 
auto glass supplier, for something less than $200 cash and carry. If 
they don't have one in stock they can probably get it next-day. For 
around $250 they should install it for you, which protects you from the 
risk of it breaking during installation.

The price may vary by region, but that was what I was quoted last year 
on a Vanagon windshield in Toronto. From what I have heard the bay 
windshield is still in production, so they shouldn't be hard to get.

Happy Trails,
