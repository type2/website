I wouldn't worry about the spark plug as long as the threads were
clean with no evidence of aluminum threads transferring from the head.
Just take it as a lesson learned on correct torque for the plugs. Use
anti-seize compound on the threads too.

The starter is a bit tougher to say. I don't generally see solenoids
fail. The contacts get burnt, which can be cleaned up. Take apart the
old one to see what you can learn, and if you can recondition it and
the old starter to make a working spare.

If you feel confident with what you have learned from that process,
take the new one apart too to see if you can do anything for it.
