Thanks for all the info and advice on this.

All this was instigated when I reconnected the tachometer that had been 
inoperative since we got the vehicle.
Now I look at the damn thing all the time.  I was going to reconnect the CHT and 
oil pressure gauges as well.  I might as well push my obsessiveness just a bit 
further.  Eventually I'd have enough gauges so I could pilot the bus on IFR 
rules.

However, as it stands, we're probably going to sell our beloved, but that's only 
because we've found another that will better accommodate our growing family!

The only problem is that the new camper doesn't have a tachometer...
