Subject: Windshield 

I suggest getting it installed.  I've installed lots of glass, bug and bus.
The bus windshield gave me trouble.  I broke one.  The guys I hired broke one.
But the one they broke got replace at their cost.  So, it's worth getting it
installed, and only buying one windshield, not two like I did.
