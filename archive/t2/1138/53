Dave,

This could be several things. Clutch hydraulics is one. You should be
changing brake fluid every couple of years, and bleeding the clutch
slave.

There is also a double ball-and-cup joint in the shift rod, out of
sight on top of gas tank. One of the ball-and cup joints might have
grown worse (one of them tends to be in bad shape after 30 years, and
the parts are NLA). It could also be the connection between your shift
lever (the one you touch) and the rod. Try "pumping" it up and down a
couple of times. If there is a lot of play, there are replacement
parts for that.
