Subject: RE: [T2] AIRS rescue story

Awesome, news. It was two brothers, right? They are both deaf and were
stranded in Lansdowne, PA (just outside of Philly).

The Teletype helper threw me off too, it was a neat experience working with
them and I'm glad to hear that they've made some progress in the trip to CA.

First of all, everybody on the AIRS list should check to make sure that
their
information is current.

...It was a TTY service for people who couldn't hear...
