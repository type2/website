Subject: Ignition Lock Cylinder

In my stash, I just found a N.O.S. ignition lock cylinder(yes, with original
keys) in my 'stash' of yet-to-use parts for my '70 Bay.  The number on the
cylinder is 211 905 855B.  I can't find any information on it anywhere.
Anybody know if this is the correct cylinder for my bus or not?
 Thanks!
Eron
