Monty -

If looking for a new Alternator Harness, I make them.  Check out my
Samba Ad for details on ordering one:

As advised by Mark Dearing, pull the alternator and have it tested by
a competent auto electrician's shop.  If you Voltage Regulator "looks"
like a "century" old, it may need replacing too - have it checked as
well.
