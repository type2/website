Subject: 1700 motor

ON a 1700 motor which I have a new set of pistons  and rebuilt heads for but 
i don't remember if their were spacers between the cylinder and block or 
between the cylinders and head. I started this project about four years ago so my 
memory is drawing a blink. IM still trying to find the metal plate on the 
passenger side of a 76 camper seat so i can make it swivel any info would sure be 
healful thanks,Neal
