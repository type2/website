That's good news. I didn't know you carried it until now.

To backup what Ron and Jim Thompson have said, I have spun up this Mexican/Bosch beetle distributor on a distirbutor testing machine. I posted the curve to the list a few weeks ago and compared it to several factory distributors:

The distributor is shown as CIP1 in the legend and the curve is suitable to our engines. This is the best stock distributor available for baywindow buses.

If you need one or have a 009 installed, get one from Bus Depot or CIP1 during thier 10% off sale before the supply runs out (I have no idea when that may happen).
