Subject: : temp hot no start solution

Sounds like the hot start problem.  Try this (worked for us until we put
in the relay)-  It will not go to start once runnning, so rev it a bit,
turn off the key and immediately go to start for a microsecond and back
to run- you should hear the starter gear protest if the solenoid will
work and kick it.  Then turn it off.  Usually this this works-unsticks
it while it has the extra juice of the alternator.  If you hear nothing,
let it run.

could not get it to start.
  Relay clicked, but still no sound from the starter/solenoid. We ended
up having
  to tow start Butch because I was pointed uphill with no room to back up.
