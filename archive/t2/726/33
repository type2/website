 Do you know where the #1 notch should go on these
 distributors? Did
 the one you test out have a #1 notch?
 
 The Part number on this CIP1 distributor is : BRUCK
 Germany 00113905205AN

If you are asking this because you are worried about
the #3 cyl retard degrees built into the point cam,
then do not worry about it. The retard was on the
early vacuum-only distributors on the early engines
before the doghouse oil cooler.
