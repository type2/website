Hi Volks,

The Westfakia has been in the driveway for 21 hours, and I still 
haven't found time to write up a full trip report as I catch up with 
work and other stuff. Thanks to MacBus Chris for putting on the event, 
Jeff Stewart and Jamie Auch for their hospitality en route, and to all 
our bus friends that we got the chance to meet up with again.

In the meanwhile, here are 9 of my favorite pics from what has come out 
of the camera so far. More stories and pics will be coming soon.
