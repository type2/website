Subject: Alternative to CHT???

Hey guys,

   Does anyone know if there is an alternative to the Cyl Head Temperature sensor? I purchased the VDO kit a while back, 
and it simply just doesn't work. I cannot figure it out. I have it hooked up correctly, but the gauge does absolutely nothing.
I had the sensor bung (the O or whatever) hooked into the underside of the spark plug, and then used the supplied
wire all the way to the gauge. The gauge has never even so much as moved since It's been hooked up. I'm so frustrated
with it, and the way you have to bend the O-ring underneath the spark plug, it's just to ghetto of an install for me.

Is there a better alternative to this? I'm really pissed because I blew something like $70 bucks on this worthless piece
of garbage about a year ago. The only thing it does is light up and look nice at night... but it doesn't give me 
any information, and the wire is hardly long enough to do a professional install. (note, I never cut the wire, shortened
it's length or anything)

How accurate is an oil temperature gauge? Does VDO sell one of those as well? And for those of you who use them, where
is the best place to mount it? Is there anything factory that I could adapt from another VW with an air-cooled motor?


Thanks!!!
