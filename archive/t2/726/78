Subject: Changing metal brake lines

Hi all,

After doing a major brake job - to be prepared for our long trip -  the left
front brake line of our '69 bay-window cracked.
I know, I should be very happy this happened in my parking box. I already
ordered these metal lines and tried to replace the broken one but found it
hard to bend it the right way. Any tips on that? It also was some 10
centimeters too long so I will have to make an extra bend on it - the
archives told the lines better be too long than too short?
So now I am a bit hesitating about replacing the line to th rear brakes
myself, as it has a long traject and I have not got too much space to move
around. Any advice?
I would like to drive our bus as soon as possible, I think doing the brake
job will be the last major job before we leave.

Meanwhile there is no more juice in the deep-cycle camping battery. Can I
load this one with a regular battery loader?

Thanks again for your help and keep it cool,

Bart
