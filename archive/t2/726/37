Actually I just got ten more today, so I'm good on stock at the moment.
(Nice, by the way, in genuine VW boxes.)  As far as I know these are still
being made in Mexico,  so I don't see supply completely drying up forever in
the near future. However, the importer that supplies most retailers of this
product (myself included) is notorious for long backorders, so it would not
shock me to see them go in and out of stock fairly regularly. In any event,
I have plenty of them now:

Frankly I have a real problem with this sort of advertising as well (no
matter who does it). The use of the word Germany in the name, coupled with
the phrase "Made to the finest OE German quality standards," seems clearly
intended (IMHO) to imply that this is a German made product, when it has
always been Chinese. To be fair, it is often hard for a supplier to tell
what is German and what is not, without opening up every box in the
warehouse. Most German companies now manufacture in many countries, and even
if you buy a major German name, what's in the box may come from one of their
other factories or suppliers. In fact I have been wrestling with this very
issue recently, as I am working on a major website update. I would love to
list "country of origin" on many of my products, but it is just about
impossible to keep up. It's a moving target. I've gotten 100 of the
identically boxed product, on the same shipment, with three different
countries of origin.  I'd pull my hair out trying to keep such a listing
accurate. I think I will have to settle for listing the country where the
company is based, with a disclaimer that the actual country of origin of a
given part may differ. At least this way the customer will know that if the
company is based in Mexico or Brazil, for example, it's more likely to be
made there than in Germany.

But to me, that is quite different from taking a known Chinese made product,
putting the actual word "Germany" in the brand name, and then going as far
as to say "Made to the finest OE German quality standards,"  when the
supplier knows perfectly well that it was never German made to begin with.
In terms of how I choose to do business, that doesn't just cross the line -
it isn't even close to the line.

Choosing a parts supplier is a matter of trust. You are putting your faith
in the supplier's expertise, and their honesty.  If I intentionally break
that trust even once, how can I possibly expect my customers to believe
_anything_ I tell them from that point forward?

Couldn't have said it better myself. :-)
