I was thinking something similar.

Another idea:  Someone used a ratchet
last time valves were adjusted.  The ball
bearing on the ratchet fell out and decided
to hang out.  This is the ball bearing
that holds the socket on the shaft.

There are NO ball bearings in a VW
engine.  Only one is in carb.

I don't know how it could have made
it from the carb, through the engine, and
into the valve cover.
