Just Kampers in the U.K. told me that they've found it to be suitable for
Type 4 engines as well. They've been selling it for that application since
last year. Considering that the 050 is long discontinued and the Bosch 009
has gone way up in price as supplies dwindle (and is not particularly well
suited to a Type 4 engine), it would seem that the VW/Bosch SVDA is the best
alternative for those who want a new distributor.

Obviously you've been to C.I.P.'s website.  I've never seen this brand
anywhere but C.I.P., nor do I know of an actual German VW parts manufacturer
of that name.  I'd guess that Bruck Germany is their (or their
distributor's) "store brand" and not an actual manufacturer at all  I
understand that this unit is Chinese made. So is their "Kafer" brand 009
distributor (again a German sounding brand name, but actually made in
China).

The Chinese have just started selling aircooled VW distributors, and they're
cropping up everywhere under a variety of brand names (some more German
sounding than others :-). While I wouldn't damn all Chinese products out of
hand, this is an unproven product as of yet.  The biggest concern to me is
the issue of quality control (not always a strong point in China). Not just
whether it will last, but whether the specs will be consistent from unit to
unit. For example, if the advance curve were way off on a particular unit,
this could damage your engine. Maybe the Chinese knockoffs are great, maybe
not, I really don't know. But personally I'm not about to risk my customers'
busses to find out. I'll let other suppliers use their customers as "guinea
pigs," and wait for the results.  Meanwhile I only carry the genuine
VW/Bosch SVDA (although I'm a bit low on stock at the moment), and would
suggest buying it over the Chinese knockoff no matter where you buy it.
