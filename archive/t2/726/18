It will work, but it may not find the retarded #3 cam lobe (provided that
#3 is retarded).

The only way you can figure that out without a distributor machine is to
put the distributor in the engine, set the timing, and then check the
timing on the other three cylinders to see of one of them is retarded.
This requires a full-circle scale on the crank pulley or some creative
measurement.
