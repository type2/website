It probably stems from the fact that Brazil got the old tooling when the
new style bus came out in Germany.  Since they were already set up to use
the king pin beam the decision to forgo the ball joint beam later on was
probably one made by a bean counter.

That being said, the dune buggy folks used to like the link pin front ends
because they were not travel-limited like ball joints.  I don't see how
this would affect a stock bus, though.
