the instructions that come with it sure seem to indicate that vdo only
intended the kit for motorcycle install, so in a bus we have to go
quite a bit longer. As far as it not working I seem to remember
someone (german auto?) mentioning that some of the vdo gauges were
reversed so that the gauge had to be wired backwards. Take a look in
the archives something should be there. Also there are many
discussions on using airplane cyl temp gauges for replacements, but
every other way seems to be the quick path to spending a LOT more than
$70.
