Until you get a different distributor, be sure you time your 009 for maximum
advance using a timing light -- i.e. attach the timing light, loosen the
distributor clamp, start the engine, pull the throttle lever on the carb
gently to rev the engine up until the distributor's advance maxes out, which I
think is somewhere around 3500 rpm(?), and then rotate the distributor to set
the advance to the correct MAXIMUM value (should be about 30 degrees) on the
pulley.  Static timing as recommended by Muir is NOT enough.  As Don
mentioned, when you have the 009 timed correctly, it will run acceptably.
