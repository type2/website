I got an email back from Gary (-at-) CIP1 personally:

"Hi Jules. Yes this "small" detail was overlooked when these were re-made. I
did measure the origional and if you measure exactly 17mm from the cap
groove edge nearest to where the condensor wire goes into the body. If you
are holding the dist with the cap locating notch towards you the edge you
measure from is on the right.
    Hope this helps,
       Gary."


All I can say is I hope this is the only "small" detail that was overlooked.

<sigh>

I now feel slightly more comfortable about installing this part now.

peace,
jules
