Subject: RE: [T2] 1700 motor, type 4 engine, copper gaskets ??

...I think Jake Raby pointed out that the head gasket shim is actually made
from several very very thin shims pressed together

In fact, the head gasket is made of at least 3 layers

...Any head rebuilder recommending the use of the shock shims, has one thing
in mind: a future failed head he can repair again

That was my point trying to save the contact area of the cylinder inside the
head but after reading your comments, I understand that other concerns must
be taken into account.  Well, what am I going to do from now.

Would any copper gasket be available for the duty and would be a good
compromise saving heads and not blow ?
