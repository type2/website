go back and re-read the tech bulletin. This is a real vw bulletin, not
something someone in their backyard made up. The heat transfer and
surface wear comment is supposedly inproved by the oil groves on the
rods, not from the shim removal. The shims between the head and
cylinder will move over time, and cause problems. Take a look at the
head I took off my 79 a few years ago

notice how the "clean" ring around all the carbon is not symmetrical?
That was due to the ring moving over time and had it moved much more
would have caused a loss of compression. All vw said was to remove the
seal from the top (which causes an increase in CR). To make up for
this they replaced the distance with a shim between the case and cyl.
Other than where the shimming takes place there is no effect to the CR
of the engine. If your friend just pulled the aluminum seals out and
didn't put the shims under the cyls then he increased the CR. IMHO
those upper seals are just a horrible thing. I would replace them if I
didn't want to pull the cyls, but other than that follow the bulletin.
