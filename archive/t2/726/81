To add to Ron's comments above, when I worked with VWG to have the
headlight switches made, we sent them original switches to the
manufacturer we contract to. When we received the first approval
sample they had copied them perfectly right down to the "Mera" name
and logo on the black bakelite the terminals pop thru.  Needless to
say, we had to instruct them to replace that with the VWG logo.

At VWG, we are very PICKY about the production quality of what we have
repro'd, almost to the point of absurdity.  But it pays off in the
end.  As an example, the 56-67 Bus Interior Mirror we make took
several prototypes and almost two years before we were satisfied with
the end product.  Another (nameless) outfit also repros this mirror,
but with nowhere the same quality appearance and fit.  We're currently
working on a small but important 72-79 Bus part right now that's been
bedeviling us in getting the material compound just right with Richard
Atwell as our approving authority.  Think it would be simple?
Sometimes it is not.
