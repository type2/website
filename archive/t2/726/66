There are two ways: Take your Dremel and modify the tin. It works - I
have seen it on Steve Dolan's Vanagon. It is a tight fit, but can be
done. Or be lazy - like me - and buy the adapter hose from
aircooled.net. This is a stainless steel hose with which you can located
the sender onto the tin or on top of the ignition coil (this is what I
did). VDO used to make a similar hose. I have both the stainless steel
and the VDO one and believe John's hose to be of superior quality. Do
not use grease gun hose - it may not last as long and by the time you
have tracked it and the required adapters down, you have probably spent
as much as the stainless hose costs.

So, in doing my research for my dash instrumentation
project (on my '74 Westy), I run into this problem:
Using a VDO dual outlet oil pressure sender, all I've
read sez you can't install this on a type4 motor due
to clearance problems. I have seen that there is/was
an adapter affair that will circumvent this problem,
but all the vendors I've been to say it is no longer
available. Can anyone help me out here with ideas,
suggestions, whatever? TIA.
