Another thing to check might be that the fuel arm is not moving enough. Did 
you get the identical 3/4-max reading on the old and new sender? If your 
resistance is reading correctly over the whole scale, make sure that the 
arm can move over the whole scale while it is in the tank. Sometimes the 
arm is bent and it hits the top of the tank before the full sweep is 
accomplished.
