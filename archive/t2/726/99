I would guess that the ball bearing in question prob. came into the engine 
through the oil filler tube. I would guess that it somehow ended up in a 
bottle of oil (prob. from some kind of filling machinery) and was then 
dumped into the engine. I can't think of any other way that a part of that 
type would end up in the engine.

Of course, without going through the pump, I don't know how one would end 
up in the valve cover except from very hard cornering. Still, I guess that 
is why we have screens on the pickup tubes.
