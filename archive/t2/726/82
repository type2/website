Subject: Re: [T2] ball bearing found in Valve Cover

Look for an exploded diagram of the carb to find the location of the 
check valve. Is it a Kadron? Solex?

Again, just thrashing around in the dark, if it is indeed from the carb 
it couldn't have made its way up through a valve guide. Maybe past the 
piston rings into the crankcase and then up to the valve covers with 
the oil? Big journey for a little ball bearing. With a screen and a 
filter in the way to boot. A true mystery.
