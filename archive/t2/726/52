Subject: Re: [T2] VDO 3 guage dash panel

An English listee stent a pic of a cool extender; it's on other 
computer.  What I did was take a Dremyl grinding tip and go around and 
around the hole until the VDO sender WILL screw in.  Pulling the distr. 
makes this easier, but you can leave it in. To grip it, I made a tool 
that will fit between the capped terminals and let you twist the gauge 
in.  I then sealed the gap round the gauge with silicone.  I used a 
multiwire cable (Radioshack; it's like phone wire) that also runs my 
dipstick temp gauge made from a digial meat thermometer.
