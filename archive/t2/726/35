Subject: Won't idle, runs very rough at higher RPMS?

Don't think that it is just one thing.
Often you'll find multiple minor infractions.
I suggest you at least inspect all the vacuum lines.
Check that gasket under your breather box.
Check the electrical connections throughout your engine bay.
Reset the points and clean the distributor cap  and rotor.
Check around the back side of your intake boot for leaks and cracks.
I've also seen lots of spark plug wires floating on the spark plugs and not
fully connected.
