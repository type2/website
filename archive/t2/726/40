74 single cab with 74 CB engine

My fuel gauge will only register 3/4 full when I have
a full tank.  I know for a fact the tank is full.  I
have replaced the gauge, the voltage stabilizer and
the tank sending unit (it's in a single cab so it's
easy to get to)and it still does the same thing. I've
also verified the ground from the sending unit to the
body is good.  Does anyone have a clue as to what
might be causing this?  It worked fine before it
mysteriously started shorting me on fuel.  Thanks! Greg
