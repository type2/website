Hi,

I just got my Bruck distributor from CIP1. Haven't installed it yet.
I'll post any info or problems I have with this part as I go.

First off I noticed there was no number 1 notch cut in the top edge.
So I'm not exactly sure which direction the distributor should be
installed. I plan on turning the engine to TDC for #1, pulling my old
009, installing the new distributor and cutting a new #1 notch in the
correct place once its installed. Sound correct?

Thanks
jules
