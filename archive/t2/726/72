And what about the adapters? Grease hose is NPT, case and sender are
metric. It's close enough to make it work. But once you rethread the
hole in the case with the NPT hose you may not want to remove it anymore
because the stock sender will not thread in properly anymore. There have
been numerous posts on the metric vs. NPT thing - check the archives.

I tried to get the grease gun hose locally first. But the only hoses I
could find had the wrong ends (you need one male - one female). A pair
of adapters from a speed shop would have made this setup more expensive
than the proper stainless steel hose form John. Also took a lot of time
running around trying to find the parts. Plus, while grease gun hose is
rated at high pressures, it may or may not withstand high temperatures
well over time.

Why wouldn't the grease gun hose last as long? It's rated at crazy high
pressures and mine is years old without fail... $5?
