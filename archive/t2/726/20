Subject: Won't idle, runs very rough at higher RPMS?

Hello,
This is my first post.
I have a 78 Westfalia 2.0L FI. I let it sit thru the winter (Iknow, bad move) and now it runs very rough at higher RPMS and won't idle. It is otherwise in excellent mechanical shape. By this I mean it received fresh plugs, wires, cap and rotor, timing, fuel and air filters last spring and the engine is an AVP rebuild with less than 20K on it. It has always run like a champ (except of course when I lost the original engine to a valve problem). I am guessing the fuel filter is clogged or the injectors are not fouled. 

Would anyone mind providing some suggestions?

Thanks in advance!

Kindest regards,
