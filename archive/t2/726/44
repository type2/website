Subject: [T2] VDO 3 guage dash panel

So, in doing my research for my dash instrumentation
project (on my '74 Westy), I run into this problem:
Using a VDO dual outlet oil pressure sender, all I've
read sez you can't install this on a type4 motor due
to clearance problems. I have seen that there is/was
an adapter affair that will circumvent this problem,
but all the vendors I've been to say it is no longer
available. Can anyone help me out here with ideas,
suggestions, whatever? TIA.
