Subject: Need the dimensions of my bus!

I am trying to get a guy to do the bodywork on my bus and paint it in his
spare time.  He needs to know how hight it is to see if it will fit in his
garage.

Can anyone supply me with the dimensions including height so I can get
that to him? The bus I am wanting the work on is a 78 westy poptop.

Thanks and Kindest Regards,

anti-personnel mines; the violence of drug trafficking; the violence of
racism; and the violence of mindless damage to the natural environment."
