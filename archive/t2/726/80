I'd be very surprised if anything that came in through the intake could
find its way to the valve covers!  It would have to get past the pistons
and rings, into the crankcase, up the pushrod tubes (against the flow of
oil) and then into the cover.

I'd say that it is more likely that the ball bearing accidently found its
way into the cover when the cover was off the engine.

In any case, if it's running well, don't sweat it too much!
