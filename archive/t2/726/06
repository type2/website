Hi Todd,

There was a bad batch of VDO CHT gauges sent out last summer, you 
probably have one of them. Swap the red and black wires from the sender 
and it will work perfectly. IIRC the problem is with the sender, as 
when I swapped a "known bad" gauge into my bus's gauge pod it lit up 
perfectly.

Happy trails,
