Subject: RE: [T2] 1700 motor, engine cylinder shims

I am just rebuilding a 2000 and the set up is the same for any type 4 engine
including 1700.

Yes, there is a spacer between cylinder and block. It is about 0.010" thick
(taken from the full Victor gasket set I purchased.

Yes, there is a spacer or I prefer to call it a gasket between cylinders and
head.  It is about 0.060" thick.

I made all the measurements of volumes (in head, the recess in piston, deck
height), calculated supplied shims in the formula and ended up with very
close figure to the 7.4 standard compression ratio.

I heard some people do not fit back the head gaskets and do the same way "no
gasket" arrangement there is on Type 1 engines, lapping the mounting surface
using the piston cylinder.  It surely works but beside changing compression
ratio, it is not a good idea because it can lead to head surface "wear" and
shorten life of head.  Gasket acts as a buffer between cylinder and head.
It is recommended to install copper gaskets on Type 1 engines to "correct"
original no gasket design.

Thicker shims are available for cylinder to block.  Sometimes required to
adjust compression ratio when you get the heads flycutted and you loose
volume in this area.
