Subject: Alternative to CHT???

Your CHT gauge has a + and - side. The circle on the end of the wire is a
thermocouple, it goes under the #3 sparkplug.
The only other wire to the VDO gauge are the Dash Light power supply and
ground.
Some people get - a - going before they read the instructions and can ruin a
gauge quickly with 12v across the gauge.
However! My gage worked great but the cheap VDO construction got me. The
face pulled off the plastic case and after my repairs it sticks out 1/4"
from the gauge mount. Not a pretty sight.
