In fact, they are _very_ clever in the way they phrase their text
describing this distributor.  Quoting the CIP website:

"Made to the finest OE German quality standards"

This statement, read loosely, seems to say that this is a distributor
made in Germany to the original equipment manufacturer specifications.

Read critically, it says exactly nothing.  The "OE German quality
standard" that they are using might be "made of something that looks like
metal and plastic in a factory anywhere".  They emphasize that CIP reworks
these distributors in-house, which seems to tell us that the factory
quality control is a lot lower than one would expect in Germany.

As always, we buyers have to beware and always buy from suppliers who are
straight with us.
