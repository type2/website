That's cool... I've been wanting those numbers too.

But keep in mind that California uses a visual inspection as well.
That's why I listed the stock hardware. There are some convoluted
rules regarding any variations... But again, unless you're picked out
by the police or an automated sniffer (thank God the 800 number for
reporting "offenders" is defunct!) your 73 will not need to go through
the process.

Achieving those emissions numbers is an admirable goal however,
wherever you live.
