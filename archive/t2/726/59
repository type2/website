Mark, the NAPA was the only LOCAL FLAPS with any selection of retainer 
clips.  They had maybe 30 internal  clips in a big, red box.

There were three circlips that were a close match to the one I showed them.  
Like maybe 1 mm difference in ID between the three, but of course I was 
concerned about the OD.  This is how we made our selection, on the OD 
comparison.

I CANNOT imagine that there would also be even a minor difference in the 
thickness of the circlips.  that would cause TOO much variety for anyone to 
manufacture and supply.

I will start to save the circlips from any TYPE 4 motors I come across and 
take apart, now that I have the perfect snap ring removal tool for these 
circlips.

BTW, I have not talked with Steve Dolan yet, but yesterday I drove by his 
place at lunch to see the '67.  Nice.  You did a good job on the painting.

[Steve is only 2 miles from my office, and I had to go to an AutoZone near 
his house to 'rent' a pittman arm puller and a cylinder wall hone.  Class 
starts tomorrow on the intricacies of the '72 PDSIT 32/34 carbs, and the 
difference between the '72 and the '73-'74 PDSIT 32/34 carbs.  Time 
permitting, the 'itinerant teacher' and I will have a go at honing three 
Vanagon cylinders.]
