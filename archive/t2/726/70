I don't blame you, particularly when a competitor pushes the truth that
far.

Reading between the lines of CIP's web site, as well as CIP's comments to
other VW forums, it seems that they took a Bosch distributor, handed it to
a Chinese manufacturer, and said "copy it!"  Unless the copier has access
to the original prints of the product, there is no way that they can
duplicate it exactly, as the lack of a "#1" mark on the Chinese
distributors indicates.  If we're lucky they can come very close, but in a
price-driven Chinese factory I doubt that this is the case.  CIP admits
(boasts, actually) on their site that they rework the distributors
in-house before they ship them to the customer.  That does not sound like
"OE German quality standards" to me!

I'd rather pay a premium for a Mexican or Brazilian product that
is made by people who have access to the original prints of the parts.
