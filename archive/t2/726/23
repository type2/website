Although probably a good deal, that gauge is butt ugly if you ask me and it doesn't come with their mini wiring harness according to one person I know.

I installed one of the round Solarix gauges with black bezel (add -K to the part number) and I put it a the VDO rubber (safety) mounting:

The Dakota Digital gauge is the only accurate gauge out there in this price range. It's not VDO pretty but looks can kill (engines that is :-) and once you get used to digital readings you won't do back.

I used my own 14mm ring terminal and bought some bulk k-type thermocouple wire, a plug to disconnect the wire for engine drops and voila.
