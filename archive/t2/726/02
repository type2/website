I have not done much with them besides toss them on the site.  Feel free to add
necessary commentary to the pics for everyone's entertainment.

On a side note, we are not home quite yet.  Plan on leaving FasterLaster's later
today after some items are taken care of.  The truck is running stong now.  The
issue we had in Kansas on the way out seemed to be a fuel delivery problem. 
By-passed the mechanicl pump with an electric one and all seems well so far. 
I'll follow up once we get home.  Was great to see everyone again.

Enjoy,
