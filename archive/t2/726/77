Subject: 1700 motor/cylinder head gaskets

Neal:

Contemporary thinking suggests its wise to go with the VW technical 
bulletin, and eliminate any head gaskets.  Shim the barrels at the 
block as previously discussed to achieve correct compression ratio.

Take any advice from this list with a grain of salt unless it comes 
from an established, trusted source.
