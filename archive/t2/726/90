Hello Stephen   Is it a step backwards   lets take a poll  how many have seen 
ball jts break?  Now how many have seen link pins break??   I personally have 
seen a lot of ball jts break  and only 1 link pin break.  Same goes for the 
lever pin bracket on the bay front axles  I have seen many of these break and 
never have seen one on a king and link pin axle break.    Sometimes it seems 
the older stuff was made better and there fore stronger  later and have fun
