Subject: Re: [T2] 1700 motor

On GD, GE, and CV 2.0L engines from 1975 on,  No head gaskets.
A spacer goes between the case and barrel. Read all about here:

Not sure where you will find spacers for a 1700 engine. This does not change or increase compression, what you
take away from the top of the barrel you are adding to the bottom of the barrel. Amd type I engines never had
head gaskets and the barrel-to-head wear was minimal.

I have your swivel base :)  Pmail me.

From Neal:


 ON a 1700 motor which I have a new set of pistons  and rebuilt heads for but
 i don't remember if their were spacers between the cylinder and block or
 between the cylinders and head. I started this project about four years ago so my
 memory is drawing a blink. IM still trying to find the metal plate on the
 passenger side of a 76 camper seat so i can make it swivel any info would sure be
 healful thanks,Neal
