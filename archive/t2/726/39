Subject: rear shock problem

I heard this weird noise, something almost rattling-like in the back.
Stopped and looked, stopped... you get the picture.
Got home and noticed after much 'on-my-back- viewpoint searching
that the rubber on the rear shocks/bushing has come out and the shocks
are bouncing on the bolt.

Can I replace the rubber bit or ...?
