Guesses: bad gas, vacuum leaks, bad electrical contacts for fuel injection components, injector seals, EGR leakage (block off and remove). Check the fast idle air control valve rubber elbow for cracks, check the big rubber hose from the air flow meter to throttle body, and most of all check the electrical connections on the air flow meter.
