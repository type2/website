That's not conclusive.

You are going to get different advice from different people. I think Jake Raby pointed out that the head gasket shim is actually made from several very very thin shims pressed together. If you take a look under a magnifier you will indeed see this and afterwards it's obvious that when part of the thin layer burns away, a hole will grow that leads to a major leak that the rest of the shim won't compress. In other words, bad design.

I'm for the advice in the VW bulletin after seeing so many photos like faster laster's heads. I don't think the advice should be limited to GE and GE engines: by 1990 those were simply the only engines VWoC was remanufacturing.

As far as various assembly techniques go, I believe that VW could do a better job using the stock components than most rebuilder can do with "improved" materials and "better" techniques. If VW says eliminate the shim and with all the photgraphic evidence it's hard to ignore.

Any head rebuilder recommending the use of the shock shims, has one thing in mind: a future failed head he can repair again.
