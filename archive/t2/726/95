All this talk about head shims or no head shims has me
pondering.  When I rebuilt my 79 2.0 FI I lapped and
lapped and lapped the cylinders to the heads with
valve grinding compound.  When I fired the engine up,
it had a horrible head leak.  I took it back apart,
put the head shims in and the leak went away.  I'm
familiar with the technical bulletin but really didn't
know what else to do but put the head shims in to fix
it.  Greg
