Todd(and everyone),

I am actually working on an alternative to the whole CHT problem right 
now.

I ordered and received a "kit" with a "thermister" sensor good to 
245C(473F).  Was sitting here looking at it as your post came across.

THe kit doesn't display your temperature, but trips a relay at a certain 
temperature setpoint.  Add a flashing led mounted on the dash or your old 
EGR hole in the instrument cluster and you have an "idiot" light.

Saves the pain of mounting gauges as well....unless you ***must*** see the 
actual temperature.

Could be used for all sort of temperature stuff(oil..etc).

Since thermisters are supposed to be a little more "linear" and stable 
than thermocouples, I figured it was worth a try.

The kit was pretty reasonable at less than $50 IIRC.
I'm thinking that once I know what kind of thermistor it uses, I can get 
several, and a rotary switch and use it to check other things as 
well...will wait till I look at the schematic before I decide that though.

Also got a couple of other kits of interest to the T2 list.

A setable battery low indicator(voltage) of the same sort and a small kit
that is essentially a "shift light"...tells you when you hit a certain rpm 
and then turns an led or light on.

All three kits were less than $85 I think, and then postage from 
Australia...ground post not too bad and it takes about a week-10 days.
