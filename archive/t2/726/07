The problem, of course, is that the current trend is to enforce the smog
laws without involving actual people in the process.  With judgement-less
machines running things there will be a lot more enforcement.

As long as it takes
a cop to ticket you for a smog violation and direct you to the smog
referee the vestigial smog equipment laws will be basically unenforced for
"smog exempt" vehicles except for the obvious smokers.  Cops have better
things to do.

Now, however, we are seeing automated enforcement via "Big Brother", the
roadside sniffer.  If your bus gets sniffed on an on-ramp while
your choke is still partially closed you might well get an "invitation"
in the mail no matter how clean your engine normally runs.  Sending you
these tickets requires no human intervention at all, so there is no
check on overzealous enforcement.

The same thing happened with the red light cameras.  Our city allowed an
outside company to install them and take a cut of every $341 fine charged
to a driver.  Needless to say, there are a _lot_ of fines!

The machines have become both judge and jury.  George Orwell was dead
right, but about 20 years premature.
