Subject: RE: [T2] 1700 motor

I took a look at the link you forwarded.  I have some trouble buying the
idea of removing the shim between head and cylinder because of the heat
transfer and bearing surface "wear".  I also recall a friend of mine who did
not put these shims and was advised by a reputable engine rebuilder that the
engine would blow, and the engine did.  Anyway, it's good to know different
ways of doing things.

On the other hand, compression ratio will be affected changing shim
thicknesses, no doubt about it, mostly because it changes final compressed
volume.  Look at the following numbers.

Let's take figures for calculations on a 2 liter motor. Figures are about
right.

Volume of combustion chamber: 52 cc
Volume in the dish of piston: 15 cc
Deck height without any shim: 0.030" (I changed it from the previous message
because I think I has too high just trying to remember my readings)
Total shims (bottom 0.010 and top 0.030): 0.040"
Total deck heiht with shims: 0.070" (or .178 cm)
Cylinder bore: 9.4 cm
Volume of deck height with shims: 0.178 X 9.4 X 9.4 X PI / 4 = 12.3 cc

Displaced volume by one piston: Stroke X surface = 7.1 cm X 9.4 X 9.4 X PI /
4 = 492.7 cc

Compression ratio = Total volume / final volume = (492.7 + 52 + 15 + 12.3 )
/ (52 + 15 + 12.3) = 572 / 79.3 = 7.2

Now, decrease total shim figure by 0.20", total shim is then 0.050", and
volume of deck with shims 8.8 cc.

Compression ratio is now: (492.7 + 52 + 15 + 8.8 ) / (52 + 15 + 8.8 ) =
568.5 / 75.8 = 7.5

Numbers are there.

Hope it can useful.
