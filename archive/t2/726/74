I'm actually quite surprised they overlooked the #1 mark because,
ironically, little cosmetic things like this is what the Chinese
manufacturers tend do particularly well. In fact, they sometimes copy so
exactly that the results can be almost comical. I know of a company that
wanted to have a particular long-discontinued plastic part repro'd in China.
They sent a used original sample to the factory, and asked for a functional
replacement. The factory sent them back an identical copy - right down to
the original manufacturer's brand name embossed on the part!  Needless to
say they passed on it, as it was more counterfeit than repro.  I know of
another company whose sample arrived at the factory in China with a small
rip in it. Sure enough, the Chinese factory impeccably duplicated the sample
- right down to the rip!

Of course, manufacturing a complicated mechanical or electrical item is a
far cry from making a plastic trim piece. It involves precision
manufacuturing to tight tolerances and a some amount of engineering, not
just copying. Whole different ball game.  I have seen a handful of Chinese
made electromechanical items that seem to be done quite well. (VWG's
headlight switches come to mind.)  I have seen many more that were
absolutely abysmal. It's not that there are no quality manufacturers in
China. The problem is that there are many lousy ones too, and you can't
always tell from the outset which is which.

There is no question that China is poised to become the "next Japan" in
terms of the sourcing of many consumer items, from auto parts to automobiles
themselves. (Malcolm Bricklin - who brought us the Subaru and the Yugo - is
already planning to market cars here from Chinese manufacturer Chery.
Considering how derivative their brand name is, it's not too shocking that
one of their models is an almost exact copy of a small car made by -
surprise! - GM.)  As with Japan, Korea, and others that came before, there
will inevitably be a learning curve, but over time the overall quality and
consistency of Chinese made products will gradually improve.
