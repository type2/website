Subject: Brazilian buses don't have ball joints

I've just finished reading the latest volksworld magazine, and was 
intrigued to read that the new buses from Brazil have king pin/link pin 
front suspension rather than the ball joints we all love pressing out at 
renewal time. This answers a question that had bugged me for a while - 
why can't I buy a brand new front beam for my 73, when I can but a brand 
new front beam for my beetle. However, it also opened a new question - 
why did VW make the backward step to pins rather than ball joints? Do 
they have advantages?
