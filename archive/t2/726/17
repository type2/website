Subject: Re: Alternative to CHT???  (and non-functioning CHT)

I had the same problem.  Reversing the wires at the gauge did the trick.  My
main regret is not testing the gauge for a benchmark before I battened down
the hatches.  It does seem to give consistent readings, though, when one
accounts for the outside temperature.

I placed my cold junction just ahead of the engine compartment, out of the
main airstream, where I can be fairly certain the temp is close to ambient.  I
may not know the real CHT within 30 degrees, but I'm a lot closer than I was
with no gauge at all!

Richard will no doubt chime in with what he's found to be a good alternative.

good luck,
