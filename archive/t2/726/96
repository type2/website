Subject: Re: [T2] VDO 3 guage dash panel

Hi again, Tim,

Yes, I did that, also.  when I first installed it, I made an extension 
similar to what BusBoys and perhaps BusDepot used to offer made by VDO. 
  Essentially it was a female fitting that went into the oil pressure 
switch hole, had a short length of fuel hose, and ended with a female 
fitting that attached to the VDO dual sender.  The sender, itself was 
simply clamped to a nearby clear spot on the engine tin.  Several 
months later, when I had the engine out for new heads, I removed the 
tin, took my handy Dremmel tool and recut/reshaped the oil pressure 
switch opening.  That's proven very satisfactory for about the last 15, 
000 miles.  Good luck again, Tim, but with the thorough homework you 
are doing you shouldn't need luck.
