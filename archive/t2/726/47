Step one is to remove the set screws from all four arms.

Removing lower torsion arms is a doddle.  The only problem that you might
have is removing the ball joints from the steering knuckle.  Get a proper
ball joint puller. Once the knuckle is off and the set screws released,
the arms will slide right out.

Removing the upper torsion arms is bad.  first, be sure that you remove
the bump stops before you take the weight off the front end.  Second, put
a coat of grease on the horn.  Third, get a prybar and coat it with
grease.  Fourth, pry the torsion arm up a bit and hit the ball joint end
with a "bigger hammer".  It *will* come off, but it is rarely cooperative.

On reassembly, make sure *both* upper arms are started before you attempt
to lift either onto the horn.  That lift will twist the leaf pack and make
starting the other arm on impossible.

OOK!
