Oddly for daily beaters I've somehow become a Chevy guy, and I'll say a few
things.  I always thought they were stupid, and figured they'd strip out as
has been mentioned.  Instead I've found side posters to be ridiculously
reliable and convenient.  Seems like with crappy replacement top post clamps
(or even high quality $10-15 each top post clamps) to me the damn things never
really work/hold as well as you want them to compared to OEM top post clamps
(which after 30+ years are usually pretty long gone.)  And a couple uses of
the cheapo lead ones and they don't hold at all anymore, and the nuts bury in
the lead, etc, etc.  Side posters just work for me fine every time.  As has
been mentioned, the bolt length has to be correct to not bottom, and you must
take care to not strip them, but I've never done it even though I worry I
will, andI got 4 of them between 2 trucks and my big air compressor now and
have had 2 other trucks with them in the last
 10 years.  I think it is a great idea frankly.  Off the top of my head
without walking outside I don't recall if the ground and hot will be correctly
positioned or not, I think it may well be, but that could be a small rub. 
Anyway I have a top post Optima myself with the top wing nut lugs as well in
the '77 to avoid a host of other problems, and like is mentioned with any deep
cycle, it is a convenient way to go as well.

thinking of the simplicity of using a sidepost battery setup, since the Type2
posts can be interesting to get at. I'm just wondering if anyone has done
this, or is there any reason why this would not work? I'm kind of tired of
reaching way in there to detach the ground strap in a semi-hidden position.
I'm thinking the view will be much better on a sidepost setup.
