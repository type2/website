Having no current between the + terminal and the (disconnected) +
cable only says you have no parasitic draw in your system, which is
good.
I've got a little bit of parasitic drain ever since I hooked up my
stereo. If I don't drive for too long, or plug in the trickle charger,
I'm going to drain my battery.

Another way to measure the exact same thing would be between the ' - '
battery pole and the (disconnected ground strap) body chassis.
