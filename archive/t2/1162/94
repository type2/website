Subject: Re: [T2] Straight pipes for a '78 engine

For 175 dollars you can have the heaterboxes replaced with these headers that
I have on my bus. Syd Clarke has them as well. They remove any heating ability
that you would have unless you have a gas heater like me, but they sure take
care of the myriad leaks our systems seem to end up with. They are a bit
louder because they are single wall pipes, but a stock muffler hooks up to
them, and I can't hear any significant noise increase with them on. The only
difficulty I had in mounting them, was I had to dimple two PR tubes a tiny bit
to clear the header pipe due to them being jig-built with small discrepancies
in their manufacture. It was an easy dimple with a ball-pein hammer ( couple
of light taps) so that the header didn't sit directly on the PR tube and
transmit heat. Anyone that works on our vans would find this a trivial matter
compared to other things we do! Just don't make a big dimple that interferes
with the pushrod itself inside, and who knows, maybe your set of headers won't
even need dimpling. Here's the link,
