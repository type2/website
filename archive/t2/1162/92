The difference in price might just be NAPA. I prefer to shop at Napa but 
sometimes it is obvious to me that thye simply think more of their 
products than some of the other sources. A fuse panel that I was going 
to buy at NAPA was $30 and the same fuse panel (diff brand) was $7 at 
Advance Auto up the street. I'll pay for quality most of the time but 
there really wasn't any difference in these two items.
