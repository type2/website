Subject: Re: [T2] OT: emergency flasher relay in a 1968

I've got a '69 single cab, and the turn signal and hazard relay has always
given me grief. Whenever I get around to thinking about working on it-it
works fine. The rest of the time, the turn signal will blink once or twice,
than stop. Sometimes at night(ie when headlights are on) when I use the turn
signal the brake reservoir light comes on, in time with the turn signal.

 

I figured this has something to do with a relay of some sort. If I get the
relay that Jim is talking about, are there directions with it to describe
how to install it? It looks like a lot of wires in the picture. Also is this
compatible with a '69 singlecab?
