Jules, some urethane in the 60-70 Shore A range will last a lot longer than
stock with much less deformation, and little sacrifice in comfort.  It will
squeak if you don't use some good silicone grease on it however.  If black it
won't look tacky/draw attention either.  Over 75  A, gets progressively
harder/rougher.  I think factory rubber is in the 40-50 A range.  Even the
60-70 A urethane turns/drills fine and cleanly with standard tools without
gumming up.  Stock rubber is a pain to turn as you surmise.
 
Anyway again if
you know a buddy with a lathe, 1-4" rounds in red, black, natural are only a
click away on your favorite auction site or many suppliers, even
McMaster-Carr for not much money.  I'm still using a 2"x32" chunk of red I
bought 8 years ago for all kinds of things.  However it only makes sense if
you got someone who can turn em for a beer and some BS.

Good thinking, though
I'd rather go with stock-ish materials if
available and I'd imagine rubber
might be more difficult to turn.

Thanks for the suggestion though, it's a
great idea
