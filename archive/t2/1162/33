Subject: Re: [T2] Thinking of going to a sidepost battery.

I use sidepost occasionally,,   I tend to use what is laying around, vs
going to the FLAPS to pay for a new, correct one.

sometimes I install the adapters to convert the side term to top posts so I
can use the same cables in the car

sometimes I install studs in the side post battery, so I can stack ring
terminals and use wing nuts like a marine battery .

what I normally use it a bolt that has long threads,, and put a nut on the
threads, slip in the ring terminals, then bottom the bolt out in the side
post .. then tighten the nut on the ring terminals.
this leaves a fair bit of exposed bolt sticking out from the battery
this can make it very easy to clip on jumper cables..
but , i could make it very easy to short out the pos term and create a
dangerous situation...  so be careful out there.
