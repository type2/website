yes, the diodes in the alt can go bad... and allow the magnet winding to drain
the battery
there is a large red wire at the starter , that goes to the alt..  if you
disconnect it from the starter..  reconnect all the other wires.. and do the
"lamp" test again,,

  I have been told that the alternator can cause this. I am having the same
problem. I am trying to fry bigger fish at the moment, but I would check out
the alternator. I think it has something to do with the internal voltage
regulator. Good luck and keep thelist posted . Keep the list posted on what
you find.
