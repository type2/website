John I wouldn't fear it.  Even if slow, works faster than you could do a head
shake one for instance.  I got a real Miller came with my welder, and I don't
like it half as much as the $50 Chuck Homier one I've had for 10 years, the
Miller eats batteries, and doesn't adjust as well as the cheapo.  I do know
oddly that most pros still use the old style ones, I have no real idea why,
bought my first auto darkening insert (just the lens insert) for $129 back in
'94 when the local weld shop got a load of them (Chinese I'm sure) in and have
never looked back.  Shit dad still runs that one today actually.

Plus not
sure I trust the Chinese auto-darkening helmet from Harbor Freight.

I had
tried a real helmet from a retired pro, but being old school,
without a flame
lit, you can't see anything through it!
