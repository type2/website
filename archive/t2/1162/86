I do not believe anyone makes straight pipes for the type IV engine, I 
made my own bet stripping off the heater boxes on a set of good pipes 
with heater boxes that were trash.   got the 75 pipes as the mufflers are 
cheaper and better quality.

I just drilled a hole in my current inspection plate, be carefull the oil 
temp sensor will hit on the inside if not placed accurately it has to be 
off center, is a good spot as long as you keep the wiring up, I wrapped 
mine around the mustache bar so it wouldn't hang down and get hung up on

keep the seals tight and plug all the holes in the engine compartment.
