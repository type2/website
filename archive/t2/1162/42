Subject: Re: [T2] How not to sell a VW van-a sour experience

> It is sad that people purchase vehicles to resell but aren't honest enough
to say so.
> The van may have been all that you saw it to be but I understand your
hesitation in not completing the sale.
> In this area of the country you must have a dealers license if you sell more
than (i think) 4 cars a year.
> I am sure they paid much less and had hoped to get there quick return on
their investment but there is nothing like honesty when dealing with people.
> I see this all the time and you often see cars (curbed) for sale that
clearly should still be registered if being sold honestly.
> These type of guys make you feel like a victim even when you don't purchase
their car.

weekender with poptop.  Maybe we were paranoid- what do you think?
