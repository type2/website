While I've never hand the chance to sandblast, it's something I've read up on
in the past (maybe 10-15 yrsw ago) for a project that never materialized.  I
remember someone making an argument for using walnut shells as the medium
because they caused less heat during the blasting process and reduced the
chance of warping panels.  Anyone ever used them?  Is this just nonsense?
