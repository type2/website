Subject: Re: [T2] How not to sell a VW van-a sour experience

CarFax works well with cars newer than 1982 but I haven't found a better
source than your gut feeling for older cars.
I have bought and sold many cars over the years and have always had good
luck.

Though Jim I would have to say that I don't know how you get a title flipped
without have exchanged any money.
I have never taken a trip to the MVA for anyone and can't say I ever would.
That is half a day process here and I would have to be getting huge bucks for
that car.
In fact in Maryland the title must state how much you paid for the car. In the
case of money after the fact you wouldn't have to pay because according to the
law you already own it with title in hand.
So to a guy like me you would look like the scammer and you wouldn't be buying
the car of your dreams.
I am not saying you are a scammer but this is why I say we must all use our
own discretion and rely on our gut feelings toward one another.

It is sad that the world is full of takers and those of us good guys feel wary
of others.
Whatever happened to a handshake being a contract?

the sellers hand me the signed title which I then took to the DMV.  Once I had
a new title in hand with my name on it, then and only then did the seller get
their money.
