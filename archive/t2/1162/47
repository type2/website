Jamie -sunburnt -Rivers
sunburnt because I got a new helmet,, smaller, lighter, bigger glass , than
my old one.   The old one used to cover my neck, so I dont as a rule wear
skin cover on my neck... but the new helmet allowed the UV rays to reach my
neck... sad. as I know better! especially when I started to smell that
cooking going on....... sigh....
