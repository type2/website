Subject: OT: emergency flasher relay in a 1968

OT because I'm troubleshooting a problem in a '66 Ghia.  According to 
my circuit diagrams, this vehicle shares an emergency flasher relay 
with a '68 T2.
When I flip my turn signal indicator, the engine stalls.
I need a diagram of the wiring inside that relay to guide me in 
tracing voltages.
