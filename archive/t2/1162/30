Subject: Sandblasting bus bottom.

"I am getting ready to start the bottom
half of the bus. It needs some of the rockers replaced, one rear corner, batt
tray, etc. I am going to have the undercarriage sand blasted  as there are
many holes in the frame. The floors are good. Has anyone done this before? I
a
looking for words of wisdom. Should I go ahead and cut out the obviously
rotted metal before hand?"

I would cut out all of the rusted metal (unless it would compromise the
structural integrity of the bus) before you blast.
There is bound to be rust behind them (like inside the rockers) and this will
allow you to get to it.
Good luck!
