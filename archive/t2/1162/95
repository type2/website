Subject: 6V to 12V motor swap...

I once again am looking for some guidance with some VW motor stuff. A couple
years ago my 6V bus motor (vehicle A) had some problems with one of its
heads. I had a 12V motor in another vehicle (vehicle B). I figured now would
be a good time to upgrade the 6V bus(vehicle A). So armed with list support
I changed my bus over to 12V, and took the known good motor from Vehilce B
and put it into Vehicle A. (Along with grinding out the bellhousing,
changing bulbs, starter.and a bunch of other stuff I can't quite remember)

 

Eventually I had the 6V motor's head repaired. 

 

So now I've got this 6V motor(originally from vehicle A), and want to put it
back into the vehicle that was 12V (vehicle B). I understand I will need to
get a new generator, but was not sure about the flywheel(which I believe is
a 200 MM 6V). Or what else I might run into.

 

I was also wondering about an alternator-ie pros and cons of switching from
a generator to an alternator, are the super charged ones worth it.

 

Thanks for any tips on this...
