I located my 3/4" drive 46mm socket, extension and socket handle 
tonight. Stored away in a drawer. Never used it before. Hopefully it 
will hold up for my needs. I bought it at a tool store, unknown brand. 
Looked at the hubs tonight and think I may have to fab a plate that is 
held down by three of the lugnuts and has a steel bar welded to it that 
will lock against the bottom of the body or chassis to keep the hub from 
rotating when I try to loosen it (no brakes, no tires). Like a 1" piece 
of square tubing welded to the plate. Perhaps with a second smaller bar 
that will slide out of the larger bar for easy placement. Perhaps a set 
screw to hold it in the extended position.

I don't want to have it push against the garage floor b/c the bus is on 
four jack stands and the torque might push the bus off of the jack 
stands. Maybe position the breaker bar at 10AM and the holding bar 
against the floor or chassis at 3PM. Push down on the breaker bar.

Maybe Thursday night. I promised a neighbour to install Mint Linux on 
his computer and tutor him on it a bit. If anyone here wants Linux or 
help, let me know and I'll try to help you out.

Thanks folks - learning lots here as always...
