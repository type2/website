Subject: Multimeter help for the idiot

I was trying again to see if I had any current draw so did some internet
sleuthing to help me figure this out. I can rebuild engines fine, tune
motorcycles, etc, etc, but when it comes to multimeters I am an idiot. I think
I did it right, but want some backup on this. I put my MM between the +
terminal on my new battery and the + cable. I then set my RadioShack MM to the
notch marked 200 DCmA which also had a solid line beside it with 3 dots under
it. I then took the reading, and it said 00.0 ??? I reversed the leads and it
then said -00.0
Does that mean I have no current draw at all?? I am lost, because I have a
small digital volt gauge plugged into the lighter that MUST be drawing
something??
 The MM reads voltage across the battery fine, at 12.74volts, so I think it's
working fine. What am I doing wrong??
