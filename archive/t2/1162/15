Doesn't worry me much at all.  Never heard of a bearing being damaged 
this way.  What worries me is when I hear of someone standing out on the 
end of the six foot cheater and bouncing up and down.  Lots of energy 
can get stored up in a heavily loaded bar and when things let go bones 
get broken and teeth lost.
