Hi Bob,

Remove the manifolds that run between the heads and heater boxes. Swap 
the left and right sides, so they now point towards the rear of the bus 
instead of the front. Now you can have custom mufflers connected 
directly to the output flanges.

A few years ago I did this, with a local bike shop welding Harley 
Davidson mufflers onto the headers. They stuck out about half an inch 
beyond the bumper and looked pretty good. Unfortunately they were VERY, 
VERY LOUD, so I didn't run them for long before reverting to the 72-74 
setup i had been using previously.

I have seen other people use these manifolds connected to oval-section 
domestic market mufflers, that turned out to be a much quieter solution.

Happy Trails,
