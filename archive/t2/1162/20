I used a side post for a long while mostly for the reason you note.  I 
had a set of posts that would screw into the threads on the battery so 
the original cables could be used.  Make sure the battery holddown is in 
good condition though.  You don't want the battery falling over and the 
posts hitting the body, big no no it that happens.  In the long run 
though I went back to the top post battery.  Just not that much trouble 
to loosen the nut on the negative terminal, though I have a progressive 
carb so I have very good access to the battery compared to a bus with 
fuel injection.

I'm just wondering if anyone has done this, or is there any reason why this would not work? I'm kind of tired of reaching way in there to detach the ground strap in a semi-hidden position. I'm thinking the view will be much better on a sidepost setup.
