Between the list admins keeping an eye -- and if necessary
a thumb -- on threads going offtopically out of bounds, and

Between fascism, and anything that goes on on this list?  Nope.

Between your question, and common sense?  Welll ...

Airhowlingly yours,
    Ermel, who considers this thread killed.
