I often make the seller go with me to the DMV, that tends to take care 
of the flakes pretty fast.  For the last Vanagon I bought and the last 
Bay I had the sellers hand me the signed title which I then took to the 
DMV.  Once I had a new title in hand with my name on it, then and only 
then did the seller get their money.
