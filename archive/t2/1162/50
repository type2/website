Sue should stop worrying as I am sure these men have moved on to the next
quick dollar.
When in doubt always lean toward your own protection and don't worry about
offending the person selling to you.
As you have shown they were not the honest ones in this deal.
As it was also pointed out they would have had to had the power of attorney
notarized and over nighted.
I doubt that really happened.
