Subject: Re: [T2] Multimeter help UPDATE-77 Westy-Thanks so far!

Just want to thank everyone for the myriad suggestions I've received so far; 
I'm still working on this. I will do so over the next week or until I find 
it. I thought I would update with more info. I have a gas heater, and 
therefore, the bigger 70amp alternator. I have had suggestions to pull the 
alt regulator, but darned if I can figure where it is? I know what it looks 
like, but I thought it would be on the back wall near the dual-relay?? I am 
now sheepishly asking where it is??? :-)
Thanks yet again,
Courtney
