Just a thought, you can not blow a wrench up in your hands when your 
remove the ground cable as you too easily can when removing the 12+ 
cable.  Always remove the ground cable first and install it last.  You 
can do all the same test with the ground cable removed as you can with 
the positive cable removed, so there is just no good reason to do the 
testing there for any reason.

I merely removed the +ve cable for a moment to disconnect the other smaller +12v wires that ran to my battery charger and the diagnostic plug. Appreciate any further help you and all the others are providing.
