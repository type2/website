Subject: Multimeter help UPDATE-77 Westy

OK, so something is def. not good here. I wasn't getting anywhere with the
multimeter, so I tried the other method which someone forwarded to me, I put a
12v light between the negative cable and negative post with everything turned
off. The light came on. This is supposed to indicate a current draw. I then
proceeded to remove the fuses one by one to see which circuit the light went
out on. It didn't go out at all. I even removed the backup, gas heater, and 2
other 30 amp fuses on my Westy. Light still stayed on. I took off the positive
cable and removed the red + wire to the VW diagnostic plug at the back
thinking it might be grounding, along with the other factory small +ve wire on
the +ve cable that heads off into the wiring harness, then sat +ve cable back
on the post. The light still stayed on.
Where else can I check? I have removed every fuse in the van. Would REALLY
appreciate some pro help here. I'm losing about 0.3 volts over a 16hr period.
Thanks,
Courtney
