Subject: Brake Question for 71 Westy

Got a leak between the master cylinder and the brake servo. Leaving a spot
on the driveway the size of a tennis ball. No reduction in brake performance
(yet). I'm thinking it must be the oil ring. This is the original master and
servo. Nothing been changed but the front calibers and rotors on the bus.

 

Would you change the master out for a new one or just the o-ring and how
long do the servo's last. I was thinking of getting the vacuum chamber servo
rebuilt while addressing the leak, Someone told me that there was someone
around Dallas that could rebuild the powered brake servo.
