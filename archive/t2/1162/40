Subject: re:Sandblasting bus bottom.

I did this myself a couple years ago to the underside of my '65. My mechanic
let me use a corner of his yard, and a lift. I was able to basically stoop
down under the bus and sandblast it. I had a cheap sandblaster thing from
H(-at-)me Dep(-at-)t. It cost less than $20. It is basically a gun with a rubber hose.
My bus did not have an undercoating. 

 

I put some black beauty in a 5 gallon bucket, and then draped the hose in
the bucket. I then put on some safety gear-glasses, full face mask, hat
.can't remember what else. I then blasted all the way around the outside
bottom. Unfortunately I could not get to the middle section-as that is where
the lift was. I still want to get that section-not sure when. Hopefully I
can get to it before this winter sets in. It is a messy thing, you end up
with sand in everything.

 

After blasting I used master series paint on the underside. Silver primer,
and glossy black top coat.

Wow I guess I did this 6 years ago.I should take some follow up pics, so you
can see how it lasted.
