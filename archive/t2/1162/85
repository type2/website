Subject: RE: [T2] OT: emergency flasher relay in a 1968

I'll open the dash and check the connections this weekend. I know the turn
signal has been a bit wonky ever since I got the bus. If the relay is
readily available, and relatively inexpensive, and the ground connection
doesn't fix it, I'll probably just  throw a new one in.

 

Thanks for the ideas.

I agree this sounds like a grounding issue.  Check that the screw going
through the center of that relay is tight and the relay making a good ground
to the metal where the screw is fastening it.
