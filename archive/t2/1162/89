I did something similar on our 78 Transporter. Link to the image is below. I
have yet to get solid feedback about how the possible reduction in back
pressure affects torque or horsepower. Additionally, don't do the 90 degree
turns at the end like you see on mine. It's clear that this increases exhaust
noise. Unless you want it louder, of course :)
