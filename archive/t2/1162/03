Jules, buddy with a lathe?  Urethane in many durometers is available cheap,
and turns easy.  I have made several custom sets for various rigs over the
years.

Chris,

If you find those shock bushings,
please let us all know your source.
I've got a set of konis  still attached to
a removed set of torsion
arms because the bushings just wanted to pull out,
and without a
replacement source I am hesitant to do anything with them... but
I do
hate to have a set of konis on the garage floor instead of installed
on a
running bus.

peace
