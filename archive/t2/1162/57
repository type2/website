I don't know where you live Jim, but going to a California DMV with
the seller/title or just the title to consummate the deal is
tantamount to insanity.  Even with an appointment, I've waited up to
2.5 hours to be attended to.  Without an appointment, last time was 5
hours.  Good thing I had my laptop AND a book to keep me company.
Even using AAA here in California to do DMV stuff is a long wait,
especially in Southern California (outlying area offices are a bit
quicker).
