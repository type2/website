check for leaks around windshield.  since the relay is mounted upside down 
water can drip down and get into the relay and sometimes can last a long 
time.  caused me many grey hairs figuring out why my turn signals were 
wonky,    fixed leak in windshield and poured the water out of rely and 
has worked fine ever since
