From: John Anderson First, if you got factory
undercoating, you
are going to pay ot the whazoo unless you scrape most of it
yourself. 
 Fortunately though sometimes it is
brittle enough that maybe it
will blast off.  If you got to scrape,
think very carefully about what you
hope to achieve with this project.  Putty
knives +/- heat gun .

Thank you for
all of the good advice. You are right. I have to decide howfar I want to go
with this. 99% of the rust damage is on the permeter of the bus i/e behind the
nose, behind the rockers, Under the doglegs etc. The floor was repaired 10
years ago and is still holding strong. 

My goal is to cut out all the rust,
remove all of the built up and loose undercoating, repair all of the metal,
and reseal to prevent future rust. I understand that nothing is permanent, but
I want it to last another 10 years before I have to do anything again. While
the "perimeter" rust is bad, the rest of the undercarriage is n reletively
good condition. I am not looking for show quality, just nice solid daily
driver quality.  I am starting to feel that stripping every inch of the
undercarriage to bare metal may be unfeasable. I really don't want to spend
more than a grand on the blasting and materials as I will be doing the
welding, body work and painting to the undercarriage myself. I just don't want
to do the blasting. I will see how far I want to take it once I start doing
it. You know how it goes.
