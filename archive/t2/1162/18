Subject: Thinking of going to a sidepost battery.

I need a new battery now, so I'm thinking of the simplicity of using a sidepost battery setup, since the Type2 posts can be interesting to get at. I'm just wondering if anyone has done this, or is there any reason why this would not work? I'm kind of tired of reaching way in there to detach the ground strap in a semi-hidden position. I'm thinking the view will be much better on a sidepost setup.
