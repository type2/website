A couple of thoughts.

Disconnect the voltage regulator AND the charging wire from the
alternator
to either the starter (OE) or positive battery post.  Recheck

If you have a fridge (dual fuel or electric) it may have an integral
inverter (my Riv
does) and will draw juice constantly.  

Do you have dual batteries?  Then you will need to eliminate the second
battery 
circuit as well.

You still need to measure the draw.  A good, fully charged battery can
stand
a draw of 50 milliamps for about 7 days.  Until you measure the draw you 
can't just use the test light ...........  won't give you enough info.
