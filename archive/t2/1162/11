Recieved the pmail below. Thought it was appropriate to share on the lists. It
was in response to my rusted stuck brake shoe. Thanks Kevin!!

Chris,
My name is Kevin Inmon. Been on the Type 2 list since 1997. I graduated from
Antioch High in 80 and joined the Navy. 26 years in an out of Cali and was
finally allowed to get started on my dream of owning VW's. I have a 75 Kombi,
78 Westy, and my 68 Bug. I am currently working in Kandahar Afghanistan and
will be on vacation in December. I will be in Cookeville from 12 to 16 Dec. I
am up to visit family and a body shop to check them out to see if they can do
a Pan off restore on my 68. I worked at a VW shop in Fallon Nevada, call Leo's
independent  VW and buggie shop for 3 years and this guy taught me the German
way to repair all VW and had some water cool lessons too. So if your still
trying to unstick your brakes or any other problem in December, I be more than
happy to help out. You can find me on FB also, Kevin Inmon Sr. I have been a
member of the Arizona Bus club and when there was a South East VW Club
Jacksonville, I helped pout together three medium size Shows in Jacksonville
Florida. Hope you get those brakes unfrozen..

Cheers,
Kevin Inmon
