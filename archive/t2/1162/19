Subject: Re: [T2] Thinking of going to a sidepost battery.

I use marine top post clamps with wing-nut posts on them. Even easier
than side posts.

This type (random link from google searching -- can find them at any
local auto-parts store)

I hate side posts because I've had a few strip over the years and if
you want to add anything to them (another wire to power something) you
have to remember to get a longer side-post-bolt .... but not one that's
too long or you'll bottom out.
