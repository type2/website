On the other hand, flux has some advantages when welding in extremely 
tight spaces - because no shielding gas is required, you don't need the 
nozzle around the tip, allowing you to use a tiny shield, or if you're 
careful remove it entirely and get the tip down into tiny tiny spaces 
you'd never get a mig nozzle into....  for example welding a nut onto the 
broken off nub of a stud where you need to get a solid weld inside an M8 
hole....

so keep those flux parts around, they can come in handy.
