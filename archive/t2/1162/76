Subject: Re: [WetWesties] Multimeter help UPDATE-77 Westy

Thanks for the info David, I will try this when I get home from work tonight. You are correct; my clumsy writing style made it seem like I had both cables off, but I did not. I merely removed the +ve cable for a moment to disconnect the other smaller +12v wires that ran to my battery charger and the diagnostic plug. Appreciate any further help you and all the others are providing.
Regards,
Courtney
