Subject: Re: [T2] Sandblasting bus bottom.

Black Diamond (same as Black Beauty). In my sandblast cabinet at work I 
use coal slag. When I lived in Italy I bought some sandblasting media 
that I think was lava based (?).

Note that I am not blasting anything outside yet. I haven't in a long 
time. Only small parts in the cabinet.
