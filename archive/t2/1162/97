Hi Kevin,
	If your flywheel is a 200 mm 6 volt you are lucky. A 200mm 12 volt  
flywheel should just bolt up. Remember to set the end play. Check to  
see that the crank is stepped and that the new flywheel has a new O  
ring installed. I've done this before. Save the 6 v 200mm flywheel.  
they are not a common find. Gary
