Subject: Re: [T2] How not to sell a VW van-a sour experience

Sue is still worrying they have "extended family" near us and will come 
for retribution? They claimed to have to gotten power of attorney from 
the grandfather "in Florida" to retitle the van in one of their names- I 
don't think it can be done that fast- don't you need a lawyer at both 
ends?  Come to think of it one claimed he had sold a lot of cars 
before.....Also, they claimed if was a daily driver as well as for 
trips, and we could tell a dog had likely been in it, but no sign of 
pets in the house, which included a woman and a baby in a stroller- as 
Sue said, who keeps a baby in a stroller in their house?
