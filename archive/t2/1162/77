Hi Kevin -

No, unfortunately this conversion relay set up does NOT work in place
of the 9 terminal relay set up common on 67-Early 68 Type 2s.  To
correctly convert that year period over to a working system, it's best
to follow Matt Roberd's advice.

http://www.type2.com/library/electris/vw-9prong.html

On late 68 thru 1970 Type 2s, these use a 4 Terminal Relay which is
now readily available:

http://www.airheadparts.com/vintage-vw-parts/flasher-emergency-relay/flasher-
relay-4-prong-12v-211953215-c

The Type 2 went from the 9 terminal relay to the 4 terminal relay at
Vin 2x8 220 000 (the Hazard Switch changed at the same time as well).

What you describe is that some wire(s) may be crossed and you're
getting "feedback" to other lights (or devices) under/behind the
dashboard.  The positive circuit is "hunting" for a ground probably
because the appropriate circuit(s) aren't properly grounding in the
first place - electrical current flows in the least path of
resistance, just like water.  The flasher relay would not directly
cause this symptom.

Unfortunately there is NO definitive wiring diagram for the Late 68-69
Type 2 either on-line, Samba or in Bentley.  Bentley's diagram is for
the early 68 Type 2 despite what it says it is.

I am working on a subdiagram for the turn signal/hazard lights that I
hope to have uploaded to my website soon to better address and solve
the confusion.
