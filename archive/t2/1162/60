Subject: Re: [T2] Sandblasting bus bottom.

I also liked Black Beauty (coal slag) myself for inside and outside blasting
when in WV, for a couple of reasons.  Mostly it was cheap, an 80lb bag about
1/2 the price of a 50lb bag of washed blasting sand.   Next, no risk of
silicosis, always nice, not that you aren't using good breathing protection
still.  Finally and this is a positive or negative depending on how you took
it, it is initially much sharper and more agressive, however compared to sand
it fractures much more easily.  So each recycling it gets smaller, finer,
probably only 2-3 uses at initial coarseness/cutting ability then less so of
both, depending on air pressure and what you are running it through.  So I
actually would keep various grades of used stuff around in old 5 gallon
buckets, and use it appropriately depending on what I was doing.
 
Now plastic
media is nice of course as well, but you got to find it at an industrial
supplier to get it cheap enough to use, even from somebody like TP Tools, it
is ridiculously priced compared to getting a small drum bulk.  And even then,
about 20 times the cost of Black Beauty.

Black Diamond (same as Black Beauty). In my sandblast cabinet at work I use
coal slag. When I lived in Italy I bought some sandblasting media that I think
was lava based (?).

Note that I am not blasting anything outside yet. I
haven't in a long time. Only small parts in the cabinet.
