Subject: Re: [T2] 6V to 12V motor swap...

hello Kevin   You didn't say what size the engine is as they made  a bunch 
of them 6V   25hp,36hp,40hp,50hp,53hp      on most you will neeed to match 
flywheel with starter. either both 12V or  both 6 V  even if it is an odd 
bal;l 200mm 6V       you can run the 6V starter with 12V  or machine the inner 
lip of the 12V  flywheel off so it will fit the 6v engines crank.  You can 
do this on a  common brake lathe.  this is the lip where the o ring is in the 
12V  flywheel.  on 40hp engines you can have a problem with the gen, 
hitting the  carb unless the motor came out of splittie and had the larger 6V gen.

So now  I've got this 6V motor(originally from vehicle A), and want to put 
it
back  into the vehicle that was 12V (vehicle B). I understand I will need to
get  a new generator, but was not sure about the flywheel(which I believe is
a  200 MM 6V). Or what else I might run  into.
