Subject: Re: [T2] OT: emergency flasher relay in a 1968

Sounds like a short circuit in the 9 terminal flasher relay which
works both the turn signals and emegency flashers, pretty common for
this old of said relay.  Probably a bad diode or two.  If you're 12
volt, time to consider an upgrade to a conversion relay system
available for many years:

emergency-relay-repro-12v-211953227-b

I used one on a 68 Bug I owned, worked perfect.  However, it does not
work on the Early 68 Bus :(

A 6 volt version of the conversion hasn't been available for a number
of years because the manufacturer of the 6 volt switching relay was
discontinued.

A good overview by Matt Roberds is available on the Type 2 Library:

As far as a internal diagram or photo, fuggetaboutit......sorry :(
