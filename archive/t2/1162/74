Do you know which turn signal causes the issue?

I worked on a bus once that kept blowing the fuse when the owner turned on the
turn signal.
Turns out I found his battery sliding back and forth and when it slid
backwards, the battery
ground cable would touch the turn signal terminal on the right side.  All was
ok until he
turned on the right turn signal.  I forget where the battery is in a Ghia-
left rear?

Also seems the turn signals are fed by the non fused side of a fuse if they
can turn off the car
without blowing a fuse?

Sounds like a short circuit in the 9 terminal flasher relay which
works both the turn signals and emegency flashers, pretty common for
this old of said relay.  Probably a bad diode or two.  If you're 12
volt, time to consider an upgrade to a conversion relay system
available for many years:
