Subject: Re: [T2] Stuck rear brake, need advice.

If it is a gentle brake application, as the other list member said, roll 
the bus backwards on a jack and try to go forwards. Outside down your 
driveway would be better.

You could drag it (tug on it) with a 4WD and a tow rope. Be sure the tow 
rope won't slip off and fling itself at either vehicle.

If you lurch it forward in the garage, make sure you aren't going to hit 
the wall if your feet slip off the pedals.

Rapping on the drum with a brass or copper hammer might help.
