Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Stuck rear brake, need  advice.

Put tires or at least wheels on before undoing a stuck axle nut.
You don't want to tip it off the jack stands.

Safety!!!!

(and you don't have to fab stuff).

In the future, loosen axle nuts BEFORE taking off the wheels.



............ think I may have to fab a plate that is
held down by three of the lugnuts................
.....I don't want to have it push against the garage floor b/c the
bus is on four jack stands and the torque might push the bus off of the jack
stands.
