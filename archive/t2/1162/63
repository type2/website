Subject: Re: [T2] Multimeter help for the idiot

Hi Courtney,

Its not uncommon to have a blown fuse on the current measurement loop in a 
multimeter.
Also sometimes there is a separate input (move the test lead) for the 
current readings.
At a 200ma scale, if the reading is 1 or 2 milliamps, you might not see the 
meter move.
Try an amp rated scale and turn on the radio to see if you can get a reading 
and work your way down from there.

Subject: [T2] Multimeter help for the idiot


I was trying again to see if I had any current draw so did some internet
sleuthing to help me figure this out. I can rebuild engines fine, tune
motorcycles, etc, etc, but when it comes to multimeters I am an idiot. I 
think
I did it right, but want some backup on this. I put my MM between the +
terminal on my new battery and the + cable. I then set my RadioShack MM to 
the
notch marked 200 DCmA which also had a solid line beside it with 3 dots 
under
it. I then took the reading, and it said 00.0 ??? I reversed the leads and 
it
then said -00.0
Does that mean I have no current draw at all?? I am lost, because I have a
small digital volt gauge plugged into the lighter that MUST be drawing
something??
 The MM reads voltage across the battery fine, at 12.74volts, so I think 
it's
working fine. What am I doing wrong??
