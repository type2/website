Hiya List,

I recently purchase a pair of cooling fans (out of a 74, if the seller is 
correct) for my 70 Bus.  I took them down to a reputable local 
auto/electronics shop.  They disassembled, cleaned, and inspected the fans.  
They were pronounced "good to go".  I installed them in the Bus and they ran 
great............for about five minutes.  Then the fuse blew.
I wired them in exactly as Bentley shows.  A dedicated fuse (8 amper) for 
this circuit only.  They run fine for awhile, then blow.  
I separated them and each runs fine by itself.  But when both are wired - 
blammo after a few minutes.  Also this malfunction SEEMS to be tied into 
revving the engine.  If I rev it up they will blow but only after revving for 
a minute of so.
Ideas?
