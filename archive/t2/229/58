Here's the difference. Drop each one from 3 feet to a hard surface. Retest. 
In the rare event the Fluke would not pass this test, it can be sent to 
Fluke and put back into as new functional condition for less than half the 
cost of replacement. The others are disposable when they go wrong. Also, 
the Fluke can be certified to national standards at the service center. I 
doubt very much if the specs on the others would allow them to be 
certified. Compare ohms readings on a low resistance wire. At resistances 
lower than a coupla ohms, the Fluke excels, and more especially when you 
can zero out that last tenth or two of an ohm in the test leads. You can't 
prove reliably a spec call for 0.6 to 0.8 ohms except with a certifiable 
instrument like the Fluke. Bad data here could mean replacement of a good 
coil.
