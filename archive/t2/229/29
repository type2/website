Shouldn't there be a slight charge?

Regulator overshooting putting out generator max.

Reg working again.

My guess is the regulator is having problems overcoming the added voltage 
drops of the longer wire, the added connector drop at the starter plus the 
amp meter drop. The regulator only has around a 1 volt range. 10 amps and a 
resistance of 0.1 OHM = 1 volt. Minimize the added resistance.
