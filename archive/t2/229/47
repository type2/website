True.  With the addition of a steel protective plate, especially formed as
an air scoop, this could be a very effective idea.

My nervousness comes from having seen cases torn apart by oil sumps.  I
live near Baltimore, MD, home of the "manly" curb.  For some reason, in
that city, the damn curbs run as high a 10" and are a threat to even the
stock sump.  Drop the sump another 1.5" and you are asking for it,
especially in reverse.
