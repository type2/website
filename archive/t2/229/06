Subject: Re: [T2] "totalled"

my beetle was considered "totalled" because the repair bills were higher
than what the insurance company said it was worth. now consider, this
beetle is a 65 european beetle with a WORKING metal sunroof. while these
aren't as rare as i am finding my door handle to be, most metal sunrooves
have been sealed up and therefor should add to the value of my car. well,
black book, CPI guide and an appraisal from a professional would have put
the value around $4500, however, blue book lists it at about $1500 so of
coarse they offered me $1200 for my car. when the repair bills are $2500,
they pretty much laughed at me. you should have seen their reaction when
i told them what the car was really worth. if i ever get my beetle fixed,
i am going to invest the money in getting it appraised and insured
appropriately. i may want to do that with the bus. you would think that
if the vehicles are selling for a certain amount that the blue book would
reflect that... but it doesn't.

(BTW~ after wating 2 years for a settlement, i used the settlement money
to buy my bus and get it running. i wanted a bus SOOOO bad, and as little
as i got, i couldnt afford to fix the bug to begin with, much less after
getting the bus)
