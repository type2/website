Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Sensor Wiring Help



Kevin

The oil pressure sensor lead has a a quick disconnect ( no resistor, no 
inline fuse ). The oil pressure switch provides a ground to the warning lamp 
if pressure falls below a minimum level (5 lbs as I recall).

To be sure you have the correct wire, connect a 12 Volt test lamp from the 
in question disconnect to ground. The test lamp will glow dimmly but more 
importantly so will the oil warning lamp.

Remember to run this test with the key on.

Chuck
