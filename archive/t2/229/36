This is a rather poignant request for me.

Can somebody lay out -with no speculation- the
differences between the 2000cc engine and the 1800cc
engine that immediately preceeded it?

The reason i ask is because my local VW repairman has
been having trouble with heads on a 2L he built for a
customer's bus.  He showed me the head the other day
(dropped seat)  and its got air injection ports in it!
This makes it no older than 1974, right? If so, it
came off an 1800cc engine.
Is there a difference in the volume of the chamber in
the 2L and 1800 heads?  I know the rods and crank are
different (and would like to know how different), but
weren't the heads different too?

Thanks and sorry bill - i have no 2L cranks. I do have
a couple 1800 cranks...
