Subject: somebody may have a virus at work( Worm Klez.E immunity)

In the last week I have received 3 emails to the other address i was 
using for this group from  members of this group that had  attatchments 
in them.
Checking a history file i find that i have had replies to previous 
messages from them that has probably put me in their address books .
the subject is always
Worm Klez.E immunity
the  file  is probably selected  from a previous mail attachment.
All three appear to use windows outlook as their mailer.
The work at work probably is not KLEZ..
