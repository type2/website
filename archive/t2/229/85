have to agree with Steve, it is a basic problem of an old vehicle with
a long wire run.  I had hot start problems in my 78 and I had a rear start
switch for emergencies (after crawing under the bus "leaving the Kennedy
Center after a concert with a guest from Japan in the bus, talk about
Murphy)  in any case had the starter completely refurbished, bought new
starter, ran new wiring but with an automatic tranny I just couldn't
totally rewire the bus at this point so I put the Bosch starting relay in
and I resisted it as "Failure" but I have not had a single case of "Not
cranking" in the past 3 years since I did that...

it is cheap insurance while you work on the basic problem of 30 year old
wiring
