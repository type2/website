I just checked my .pdf copy of their brochure and the Marco Polo is a 
pop-top and thus my fascination with them. Mercedes does have a high roof 
called the James Cook. I prefer the compact design of the poptops.

I can comment after pulling my '78 Westy down to nits and bits that this 
body is definitely not a sunroof model as there is no steel roof above the 
passenger compartment - only at the very rear and along the sides. The rest 
is plywood for the base of the upper bed. Also the sides of this opening 
for the bed deck is a stamped panel that I doubt - but I can't be sure - 
would be interchangeable with a sunroof mechanism.

If I ever get rich enough for a used Marco Polo I'd buy one for sure!!! 
VERY nice vehicle but I couldn't bring myself to leave it out in the 
weather or haul hardware store items in it thus the attraction of my 
present Westy. I don't want to hurt it but I don't get upset if it gets 
dirty a bit.
