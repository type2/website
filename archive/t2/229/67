Subject: Re: [T2] Oil sumps

I ran one on my Type IV Beetle with no problems but I did notice that if 
you went across a mall parking lot speed bump at just the right speed, your 
sump would be right over the speed bump at the very moment that your 
suspension was rebounding from the speed bump....

Lastly your oil will be slower to warm up - not particularly good for folks 
who are around town most of the time.

If you want to cool the oil a thermostat controlled external oil cooler is 
a better bet because that will adapt to the cold weather and short trips 
better. With high quality efforts and parts you can create a nice oil leak 
free system. If you have oil starvation problem from hot footing it up and 
down mountain roads then the sump will be a good solution for you.

It is changes like this that you have to properly train your friends and 
family about IF you let them drive your "modified" VW.

FWIW.

Will my sump go back on my Beetle? Not sure. At the time I did add an 
external cooler and fan and thermostat with good results. I had lowered the 
front a couple of inches and the rear enough to level the car out. Was 
pretty low all around. Made that sump pretty low... I doubt the sump goes 
back on when that car comes out of storage for a restore.
