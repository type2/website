Subject: Re: [T2] 1970 westy~sliding door inside handle

Whoa, I didn't know a thing about a second handle.
Do all 70's have this option?
My kids would love to be able to open the door from the inside.

Also, What is this "T" Handle. Mine is just a plain straight one that noone
can easily reach from inside.
Later,
