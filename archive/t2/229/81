Subject: Re: [T2] Starting problems in the DEATH BUS

Similiar thing going on with my bus. Next time it won't start trying putting 
it in third gear and pusing back on it.

If that helps it means that the starter is getting hung on the freewheel, i 
haven't fixed the problem yet but I know that sometimes some bolts on the 
starter have to be tightened per the Muir book.
