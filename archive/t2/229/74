Subject: 3500 mile Road Trip-1 problem

Hi all,
I just completed a 3500 mile road trip over the course of 8 days. Everything
ran perfect in my 1977 2.0L w/fuel injection. When I came to the boarder
crossing coming back into Canada from the USA they decided they were going
to search me. I had turned the bus off so that I could hear the customs
agent. When I went to turn it back on I turned the key and nothing! I felt
like such an idiot. I had to push the bus into the bay to be searched and
while they were searching it I cleaned the battery terminals and tightened
the posts and still nothing. I have been able to start it with a screw
driver and later I wired a wire to the engine compartment from the starter
so I could start it without getting dirty.
My question is where should I start to look to find the problem? IS it
likely the ignition switch itself, where I put in and turn the key. The
wiring is all very clean in my bus. I don't want to cut the wires to test
them as they are all factory original.
thanks is advance for any help
Glenn
