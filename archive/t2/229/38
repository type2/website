Subject: Re: [T2] Need 2000 cc Type IV Crankshaft

I can scan in the AMC Cylinder head catalog sheets for you but you'll
find that all the Type IV cylinder head pictures are the same on the
catalog sheets.
The best source for interchange info is Tom Wilson book, how To Rebuild
Your Air Cooled Volkswagen Engine.
79-83 Cylinder heads have what are called square exhaust port.
I can't but guess that all earlier 74-78 had the deep set oval exhaust
ports.
There were also some 1975 only heads with big valves and oval exhaust
ports. They aren't even cataloged.
Things get pretty exciting after a vehicle gets past 20 years old.
Strangest thing though the cylinder heads haven't improved all that much
over the years.
I've been running new AMC from a very competitive supplier that will get
real close to rebuilt price on new heads.
I've gotten 140K out of new AMCs but I use a  cylinder head temp gauge,
RX7 Oil cooler, Notched Rods and Porsche Windage tray so I very seldom
see engine temps more that 220 (f) and cylinder head temps over 360 (f)
even in the harshest driving environments.
I'm considering building an engine with ceramic coated cylinder
compression area and piston tops. I have no idea what the results might
be but I'm a counter weighted crank away from getting the basic parts
together.
