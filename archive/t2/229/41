Subject: To Sump Or Not To Sump?

I was speaking with a guy at the Columbus Ohio VW show. He and I both have 
1971 busses. Mine a stock 1600. His an 1835. He was telling me his bus had 
been running a bit hot until he added a 2 quart oil sump. Something about 
it hanging a bit lower down in the air stream. Now his oil never gets hot, 
plus there are 2 extra quarts which help distribute heat better.

Mine runs a bit hot on warmer days.

I know Berg makes quality equipment. Before I run right out and pick one of 
these gizmos up I thought I'd ask for the collective thoughts this list.

Any ideas?
