Subject: looking for PO in TN

Does anyone know of a 75 westy from Harriman TN that was sold a few years 
back.  It is a big orange camper and the motor had siezed in OH.  The bus 
went through a few owners and i got it in Pennsylvania.  I am looking for 
the previous owner to ask a few questions and send some recent pics of it to 
them.  I hear that they did not want to part with it.  Now i see why.

Thankyou
Keith
75 westy
