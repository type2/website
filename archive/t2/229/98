George,

This varies tremendously by state!  It is very local and something that
each individual should inquire about locally.  Some states require a
salvage (or other name implying really bad prior damage) as a cunsumer
protection, others do not.  The threshholds vary as well.  If you have a
bus "totalled" inquire locally before you sign anything!
