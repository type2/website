At the very least it is going to rattle and irritate you as you drive if you
remove it.  Leave it on until you get the new one.

Advice for anyone else missing the seeal with an original canvas: if you
leave the poptop seal off for a long time, you risk rotting the canvas by
the elements as it tends to want to slip outside.  Be sure to check on your
canvas if you've stored your bus outside for any length of time and keep it
tucked in.  Air it out once in a while too.
