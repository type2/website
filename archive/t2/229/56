Hi everyone, =20

Jim, as I can now see, you must of had a nice, safe drive home to Indy fr=
om the COVVC Columbus "Volksfest" Saturday evening in your gorgeous ASI R=
iviera camper (named "Blushie") yesterday.  Wow!  What a great event that=
 was!  Over 410 entered VW's in the show, and over 90 swap vendors!!!  Wo=
ooo Hoooo!!!  Jim and I had a ball all day at the show, and at the event =
staff dinner after the show, Jim and I discussed the add-on sumps, among =
other interesting topics.  I happen to have a Berg 1 1/2 quart add-on sum=
p on my '67 Westfalia, and when they finally became available, I bought o=
ne of the special Berg manufactured 1 1/2 quart sumps for the 36hp motors=
 and installed it on my '55 Deluxe Sunroof Beetle that I drove on the 199=
9 "Return to the Fatherland Tour".  The other well respected "Tour" belie=
vers in the Berg 36hp version of the oil sump were Bill Collins who ran o=
ne on his '49 Hebmuller and Steve Hammond who installed one on his '50 St=
andard Beetle.

I like the sumps a lot!  I notice a small but nice drop in oil temp and t=
he main benefit of having almost 4 quarts of oil circulating through your=
 motors' veins instead of a measly 2 3/4 quarts.  The only disadvantage I=
 can think of with a properly installed, "QUALITY" brand (read "BERG" bra=
nd here) oil sump is that all of you crazy off-roading, crappy mountain r=
oad-drivin' fools would have about 3" less ground clearance directly belo=
w your motors.  Other than that, I think they are awesome!!!  Just spend =
a little extra to get the best machined one you can (I do like the BERG q=
uality...).

Speaking of VW Bus events, the trophies are ordered, the directional road=
 signs are printed, I've reserved three guided "lantern-light tour" start=
 times of the famous Mark Twain Cave during the scenic Bus caravan on Sat=
urday, and the event registration packets are finished and on my workbenc=
h for the upcoming "Busses Nowhere Near The Arch #18".  The Park rangers =
at Mark Twain Lake can't wait to see the return of all those "fun lovin' =
VW Bus people" as they like to call us, and the group campground that I l=
ease entirely for us is pretty much ready for action in a couple of weeks=
 from now.  If you'd like to join in on the festivities, see out event we=
bsite for more info.   www.BNNTA.com  or  www.BussesByTheArch.com   Jim a=
nd I will be there (sippin' Microbrews I imagine), so come join us around=
 the campfire!

I was speaking with a guy at the Columbus Ohio VW show. He and I both hav=

1971 busses. Mine a stock 1600. His an 1835. He was telling me his bus ha=

been running a bit hot until he added a 2 quart oil sump. Something about=
 =20
it hanging a bit lower down in the air stream. Now his oil never gets hot=
, =20
plus there are 2 extra quarts which help distribute heat better.

Mine runs a bit hot on warmer days.

I know Berg makes quality equipment. Before I run right out and pick one =
of =20
these gizmos up I thought I'd ask for the collective thoughts this list.

Any ideas?
