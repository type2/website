73 engines also came with air injection ports so it could have been either an 1800 or 1700 engine.  One port indicates a left 74 head while two ports indicates either a 73 head or a right 74 head.

Don't know, sorry.

The 2L crankshaft has smaller rod journals and a 5mm longer stroke.  The 2L rods have smaller journals (to match the 2-liter crank) and do not have a "bump" on the small end.  The 2L heads have smaller valves than either the 1.7 or 1.8 heads and after 1978 the exhaust ports changed to rectangular rather than oval.
