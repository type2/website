Subject: New Bus????

I have a little bit of a dilemma.....2 years ago, I bought my bus.  I
never owned one, and figured I would get one.  The one I settled on,
however, was not worth the money (I have done extensive work, and still
have A LOT of work to do (including tons of body work)).  This is the
pickle:  I just came across a bus in my town for sale.  blown
transmission, and a oily engine.  runs great, but no tranny.  The body is
in excellent shape, though.  my bus is a 71, this one is 74.  The tranny
can be swapped, correct?  Should I part out my old bus, and work on the
new one?  he wants 650 for it.  worth it?  I live in Mid coast Maine, and
there are very few buses here.

sorry about being wordy,
Kyle
