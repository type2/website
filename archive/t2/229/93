Hey out there...
This post has nothing to do with a van...but I hope I can ask anyway...it 
does have to do with a VW motor...I have a VW trike...it has I think a 1972 
beatle engine...somewhere around that year...anyway...I rebuild the engine 
last year...finally got it running...I hooked up a oil pressure guage...it 
seems when the engine is idling the guage drops to 0 ...but it sounds great 
...the motor that is...runs great also...now when I'm driving along...the 
guage reads anywhere from 10 to 35 ...depending on the RPM's...is this 
normal?...bad guage? ...what are the specs.for oil pressure ?...any help will 
be appreciated...just for the records...I do drive a 80 vanagon ...and 
restoring a 78 transporter :) ...
thanks a bunch ...
