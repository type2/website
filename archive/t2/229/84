WOW!!!  Consecutive "hot start" posts!!!  This has to be a record!!!  not
just two in one day, but two consecutive posts!!

OK, both of you...

1) Go to www.type2.com

2) click on "Library"

3) click on "Electrical (Primary)"

4) page down to "Starter"

5) the first article under that heading, "Hot Starting Problem: Starter
   Relay Installation" is what you  are looking for.

Certainly cleaning the contacts on the battery will help.  Cleaning the
ground strap connections (battery->body and body->transmission) will help,
but the relay is also (usually) necessary.
