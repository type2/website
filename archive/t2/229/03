Subject: Re: wrong key inserted into ignition switch/ 70 Bus

In my haste to move my friends 70 Rivera +ACo-that was parked in front of my
house at 2 am+ACo-. I accidentally put the key from my 69 DC into the ignition,
and unfortunately before I realized it was the wrong key I had turned it in
an attempt to start.  It obviously didn't +ACo-start+ACo- but it did move the switch
to the on position. I was able to get the wrong key removed but the ignition
is now in the on position, and the correct key will not go in far enough to
move it's position to off.

So my questions: 1. Have I ruined a perfectly good, original switch, and
need to replace it? 2.  Can I remove the switch and re install it to the off
position, and be ok to use the correct key in it again?

All suggestions or ideas are appreciated.
