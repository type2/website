what few people know is that there is a "green" book that list actual
value for older and historic cars.   the difference is unreal.

the blue book for my van is $800 or so the green book value same van is
over $4,500 if I recall, the blue book is for trade ins and I think the
insurance companies love em too because it allows them to low ball you.
