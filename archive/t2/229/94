Subject: Buses Of the Corn, August 16th - 18th

Hi Volks,

Just a last reminder for those in the NE U.S. and Ontario regions about 
the upcoming "Buses Of the Corn" event being held at Heber Down 
Conservation Area in Whitby Ontario Canada from August 16th - 18th.

There are buses coming in from almost every point of the compass: Ottawa 
ON,  New Hampshire, Quebec, Windsor ON, West Virginia and many other 
places. We'll be enjoying the Full Moon Bus Club's World Famous 
Breakfast Burritos on Saturday morning and having a Corn Roast on 
Saturday night. Sunday we rise bright  and early and at 9AM we carabus 
out to Canada's largest VW show, the Great Canadian Bug Show in 
Mississauga.

If you're planning on coming please send me an email, and see the 
website for directions and details.

We are still looking for contributions for the Breakfast Burritos, and 
it is hoped that people will also bring a side dish or dessert to go 
along with the Corn-on-the-cob Saturday night. We'll have plenty of 
fresh picked corn boiling up and lots of salt and butter to go with it.

The corn harvest is looking very good, and I'm looking forward to 
meeting lots more bus-drivers at the event.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
Toronto, Ontario, Canada
