My web search for "something heavier" yields at least two vendors who
will sell non-detergent oil by the case:

Millennium Lubricants - 1-800-OILS-R-US  (10W through 50W ND available,
brand unspecified)
Harvey Oil - 906-226-0866 (8-5 M-F Eastern, lists Phillips 66 ND grades
10W through 50W)

Note that for those who just need 30W non-detergent, you can
special-order a case of it at any Napa Auto Parts store.

Hope this helps!
