Subject: Re: [VB] LOUD noise, almost random, huh???

1) Check shock bolts.  Anything loose?  Rubber thingys in place in shocks, 
not jumping around?
**1.5) check Steering Damper   (the old one in my 61 was fallen apart at one 
end)
2) Jack bus up so front off the ground and check play in steering.  
3) Lube front end and adjust links
4) Bleed front brakes (can be done by self if pedal pan not on)   Does the 
fluid flow easily?  if not replace front hoses.
5) since the front wheels got hot, might as well look at the brakes and see 
how worn the shoes are and peel back the cylinder dust covers to see if 
anyfluid is oozing.  Though drums normally do get warm, so that may not mean 
anything.

May sound over kill, but whatever.  Actually, since it's your friends bus, 
I'd help her out with diagnosis and hand her rags & tools while she gets her 
hands dirty.   

Dead steering dampers make a bad vibration when the wheels hit the wrong kind 
of bump, and it stops when you hit the brakes.   Not fun.   I think it's 
about $20 for a new one.   Sounds like it's the culprit to me.

I hop in, throw it in neutral, and it starts right up, idles smooth,  
 runs great.(engine fine, I deduce)                                    
 push in the clutch, no noise. Shift into reverse, no noise, back out  
 of parking space, and proceed to drive around my block, making all    
 right turns. No noise accelerating, slowing, turning, braking,        
 anything.
 .... As soon as I make a left turn, it happens- loud, vibrating   
 noise, from the front. I hit the brake pedal really hard, like 3      
 times, and it stops, and we're still rolling. 
.......... why the heck would it only happen on left turns? What do
 left turns have to do with the brakes? >>
