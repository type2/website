Subject: Re: [T2] hydraulic valve adjustment

There's a long article in the type2 archive that I just read that it
says it makes no difference to adjust them hot or cold.  You may want to
check it out...

http://www.type2.com/archive/type2/000c01be5b5b$8a32f720$198166ce(-at-)default.html

or go to the type2 search and type "hydraulic lifters" and it's the
first article.
