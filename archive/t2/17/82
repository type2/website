Subject: Bus snobbery

This is really a Friday topic but what the heck it's a US holiday.
I'm going to make a little gripe that I really noticed this
weekend.  I'm just back in town this afternoon from a couple
days camping and looking into where we might do a fall WV
bus trip.  Did it in the '93 EV as it is the only thing around at
the moment.  Now since the list started there have always
been gripes about, how come those #!(%*(& Vanagon drivers
don't wave or flip their headlights, etc.  Now I always wave or
give any VW Bus driver of any vintage the high beams no matter
what I or they are driving.  But I notice particularly with the EV
I NEVER EVER get a return.  I mean it's got a big ole VW
symbol on the front but even at low speed approaching someone
nothing.  This weekend brought it to mind as I saw 2 splits
(real uncommon sight in WV),  passed on 35mph backroads
and nothing when I waved, same thing with 3 bays.  1 of 4
Vanagons I passed waved back at me.  Anyway it is a real
interesting perspective on reverse snobbery and I wonder if
it isn't more often the case.  So I guess my point is that don't
not wave to a '90 Vanagon Westy or even a '02 EV just because
you think they are going to think you are some psycho killer, hell
I paid less for this EV than I'd need to pay for a solid bay so
snobbery definitely isn't always a consideration on this end any
more.
