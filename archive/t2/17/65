Volks,
  Anyone in the Seattle area interested in getting together
with Scott in North Seattle to help him go through a newly
acquired 80 van-o-gone? maybe we could meet at Scott's on
a sat. evening. He has oil leaks and such. 
 Scott is new to working on aircooled buses and could use
some help getting going. I am not a mechanic but would be
willing to help.. I can do some stuff.
  I am better at chasing electrons then the mechanical
stuff. 
  Anyway!! 2 or 3 of us at once would help him get going on
getting his bus on the road! End-O-Summer event in the
making? I have done this once before and everyone learned a
lot and had a great time!
  Interested? e-mail me or
Scott at u.s.blues(-at-)emeraldcitybooks.com
