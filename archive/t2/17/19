Subject: Lately

I just got the Burrito Express running right again yesterday.  High Country
was ok but the drive up and back were fraught with tribulations.  She just
wouldn't run worth right, though she ran coolest ever.  I had, as you may
recall, retorqued the case.  While the engine was out I reinstalled a
progressive Weber, after rebuilding and jetting it richer.  I thought I had
a dire carburetion problem.  She ran nice and cool, though barely.  I know
she's running cool because oil temps are nice and low and after pulling the
long uphill from Lenoir to Blowing Rock I could hold the dipstick, put my
hand on the case, all things I could not do before.  Yesterday, for giggles,
I swapped dizzies because it acted more like an ignition rather than a
carburetion problem.  While I was at it, I looked at the coil.  It was
leaking that nasty dielectric oil all over.  That stuff acts like an
insulator as well, and it had leaked into the coil wire.  I installed a
different coil, mounting it upright instead of inverted, and she fired up
better than she has in a while!

Something to keep in mind, the parts store coils aren't made to be run
upside down.  Has anyone tried an HEI coil from a Ford ignition system?
They're not cylindrical, more like an open transformer style.
