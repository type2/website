Sounds like a bad inverter under the seat or no input/output -When you
switch to timed battery charge, you are combining the inverter and the
battery.
Look at the inverter, and verify it has 120 volts going in (will come
from the house power inlet) and then check the output (blue wire is the
positive).  Replace if the inverter is not putting out.  I'd get a
better inverter (at least 10 amps and providing filtered DC that will
run electronics without static, like a little TV.

     These fridges work best if you put cold stuff in.  They use ammonia
and do give off heat into the bus, sometimes they work better when taken
out and are inverted to distributed the ammonia. Personally I didn't
like the heat output and took mine out and put in a triple bedseat and
use an ice cooler.  MB
