well I finally got my 73 bus home and started working on getting it
started, still smiling at how good a shape it's in........it's been
sitting for many years. After replacing the fuel lines and oil, and
battery....  she fired right up...wooowhoooo....but .....carbs leaking
like me at 25 cents draft night.....webers 40m....whats the deal on
rebuilding these monsters..any advice on my best options are well
welcomed .........after carbs fixed, will move to frozen front brake
calipers and then for a drive..beep beeep.......ready to ride in high
point...
