re-built by whom,  for say GEX that is fairly high mileage

did you see the paperwork for that rebuild?? could have just been a top
end rebuild, which may or may not have been done right

that's the problem with not knowing the history, and why I tend to keep
mine a long time, takes that long to know the history because you did
it yourself

you got some good advice from DW so I'll not repeat what he said.  however
turning it by hand can sometimes tell you a lot. but don't force it.

I would highly suspect a valve, they sound like that. but it could be a
dozen or more cheap or $$$$ things

first thing I would do is remove the valve covers.  does one valve spring
stick way up??  if you pull the rocker arms does it fall out???  good sign
it is a valve

highly unlikely

good luck
