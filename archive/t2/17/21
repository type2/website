Good advice from all. My 75 did a similar thing before I bought it. The po
description sounded much the same. If the engine has not turned since it
stopped, I would suggest you pull the valve covers as recommended but also pull
the spark plugs and take a look as best you can. While inspecting the dead
engine in my van before I bought it, the valve train looked ok under the valve
covers. Looking inside cylinder #3 I saw what looked like brass instead of steel
or aluminum. A likely indication of a dropped valve guide. You can't see much
but what you do see might tell the whole story.

Be sure to follow Bobs advice about turning it by hand after looking inside.
Don't force it. In my case I found a piece of valve guide about an inch and a
half long inside the cylinder. Any force on the crank when turning by hand could
have made a bad situation worse.

Hoping your repairs are cheap simple and effective!
