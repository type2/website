Subject: Re: Gear to cam bolt torque?

I would not file the idler shaft area, if you look c;losely there are
several peen marks that must stay there, to keep the shaft from
moving-(backing out and hitting the cam gear) We have to take some material
from the area sometimes, when using straight cut gears, but we do not like
to.
