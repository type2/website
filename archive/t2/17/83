I must disagree. OEM is highest value, regardless cost.  The older cars
were designed to be maintained indefinately when properly maintained. The
newer cars are designed to be used up with little maintenance and make it
through the warrenty period. The only exception are the few cars still
built in Germany with German materials.

Note that I am happy to allow you a differing opinion and, frankly, I
expect the same from you. Despite what you offer, my opinion is unchanged.
The more original the vehicle, the higher the value to me. PPG in a 72 T-II
is no different than a broken original. It must be replaced with OEM to
restore value.

I simple don't want any room for 'chances', ie, risk of something less than
original spec. The KISS principle is paramont in my mind. Certainty of
value received is always worth more than chances of value lost to
compromise.
