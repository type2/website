Subject: Re: [T2] Sudden Loud Clatter, and then a Dead Engine...

Thanks for all the advice so far... I have expectations of the worst but 
will keep my fingers crossed till it's confirmed (and will post back to the 
list when I know).  Guess it serves me right for getting seduced by this 
relatively rust-free beauty (which also happened to be relatively 
history-less).   In the meantime, anyone know of a good re-builder in New 
England (SE COnnecticut or thereabouts) since this repair may be beyond my 
abilities (though my finances may force me to learn fast)??
