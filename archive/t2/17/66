Subject: still need help with refridg. (lots of questions)

i have been having issues with my fridge in my '75
westy.  when connected to battery power, the light on
the panel comes on and the fridge slowly begins to
work.  the back "tubes" on the fridge get super hot
and eventually start to cool the fridge.

question:  how cold is this sucker really supposed to
get?  is there anyway to "service" the fridge to make
it function better?

also, when i connect to city power...i go to flip the
switch from batt. to city and the light goes off.  no
power to the fridge.

question:  what would be the problem if the batt.
works but not the city power?  the oulets from city
power work just fine...

when i have city power on, and the fridge on, i turn
the "timer" dial.  for a split second, the fridge
light comes on...then i blow a fuse. (this is the only
way i can get the fridge light to come on with city
power switched on.)  the fuse in the panel with the
timer does NOT blow...10amp fuse...when i do this.

question: what size fuse am i supposed to be using at
the terminal on the deep cycle battery?  the fuse in
there now is a 20amp/32v fuse...and it blows everytime
the timer is engaged with the city power on.  the PO
had that fuse inline when i received the bus.

thanks again everyone,
missy:)

ps...my website is finally up.  nothing to special,
but not to shabby for a first try.
