Subject: Rotten T fitting for gas vent tubes

Hello,
My '74 has a T-shaped connector that joins the 2 vent tubes together in the
top of the engine compartment.  The other end of the T connects to a hose
leading to the charcoal canister.  This T-shaped connector is really old and
crumbly looking, and needs to be replaced.  Anyone know if these are
available?  If not, what could I use in it's place?  I went looking at my
local auto recycler, but none of the 4 buses there had one intact.  One of
them had a piece of fuel line connecting the tubes, but no T to the
canister.  Does that serve any purpose?

Thanks in advance!

Paul
