Adjusting a hydraulic to 0.006 with do nothing of the sort.  It is an old
trick to attempt to get them to pump up, results are varied as to how
well it will do that however.

As to the original question I would go at least 1.0 turn past contact on
A ROCK HARD FULLY PUMPED lifter.  As per my tech article on the
very fact.

If you can't verify by feel the lifter is hard and pumped up fully you have
to figure out why/correct it before setting the basic clearance.
