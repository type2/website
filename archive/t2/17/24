Subject: Clutch to flywheel bolts on a 75

On inspection of the bolts that hold the pressure plate to the flywheel
I found one that has a stripped head. These are 12 point socket heads. 7
mm I think. Took one to the local bolt and nut shop, they said what the
H--- is that. Don't stock it, can't order it!

No VW Dealer in my area, and no busses in the bone yard around here.
Does anyone know where I can get one of these? I don't think there is
room to use standard bolts in place of the socket head bolts.

Thanks,
Tom
