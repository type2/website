Subject: Gear to cam bolt torque?

Thanks for the advice Jake. Without your assistance I may not have
noticed the
extremely close fit between the cam bolts and the oil pump. What would
you
consider safe clearance? Between the bolts and the back of the idler
gear of
the oil pump I have .035". The studs that hold the oil pump together are
so
close to the bolts that I can't get a .002" feeler gauge between them.
these
measurements were done without the pump gasket installed and the cam
pushed
toward the pump. I don't have the equipment to spot face the gear but if
I
file the studs flush with the nuts that hold the pump together I should
have
about .045" clearance. I could also file a little of the housing behind
the
idler gear if the current .035" in that area is not enough. Your
thoughts on
this are much appreciated.
Thanks,
Tom
