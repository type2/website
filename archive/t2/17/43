Subject: re: Cooler oil with exhaust wrap?

Don't do it!
I tried that route in an effort to cool things down.  Your exhaust isn't
made to keep the heat in as the gasses flow, rather to radiate it away.
What it ends up doing is repeatedly heat treating the metal until it becomes
scaly and it will flake off.  This happened to me on a road trip and by
sound I thought I had a rod coming loose.  Same noise almost!  It wasn't
until I was getting ready for a motel parking lot engine swap that I
discovered the hole in the exhaust.

Instead, make sure your engine seals are in place, your carburation and
timing are correct, and you have no leaks in the intake system.
