I have a 12" tin VW symbol in the window of my Ch*vy Minivan for 
exactly this purpose.  I definitely want people to know I am a VW 
person, even if I'm not driving one at the moment.  Lots of people 
ask about the sign, which gives me a chance to tell them about this 
mysterious '78 Bus I never drive anymore but still love....  I was 
thinking about copying a picture of me and my bus to have to stick in 
other bus' wipers when I see them parked.

I usually wave, point to my sign, and try to yell "I have a 78 Bus!" 
It never really works, but it makes me feel a bit better.  :)

PS.  I'm hoping the new Microbus will be cheap enough for me to 
afford it.  I want one and I'm not afraid to admit it!
