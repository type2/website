Greeting for BC. Fairly new to the list, been pretty much watching from the
sidelines for a few weeks now.
Mine is a turd brown 81. So far, so good. No major troubles after the first
6 months. My trouble
Is that with winter coming, I am trying to get my heat in order. I’ve got
some heater parts coming to
complete the duct work. My question is about the control cables. How many
levers should there be
In the dash controls. I have only 3, but I would seem there should be 4 (?).
Is this the case??? My Hayes
Pictures are lacking in detail. I have just gotten the blower unit working,
but the control cabling has me somewhat
“baffled” (no puns intended). Probably going to “hardwire” the rear control
boxes for the winter so I am not too concerned about
those cables.  From top to bottom, which lever controls which flapper
arrangement???
Thanks for any help.
This list has been a gold mine of information, look forward to many more
nuggets of information in future posts.
Cheers,
Keith
81 Westy (no name as of yet)
