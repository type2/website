Subject: Fuel line question - solved

Karl,  Tim, everyone,

Problem solved.  Karl and Tim were correct, it was FI hose. Karl was also
right... what I had was 7mm, what I needed was 7.5mm.  If this had been
connecting two metal pipes, I'da gone BFMI[1], but it was the connection
to the plastic cold start valve, and that is new because I already broke
one of the hose barbs off.  Not gonna do that again!  I went back
downstairs, rooted about a bit more and came up with a length of the cloth
covered stuff and it slipped right on.  All the lines were replaced ~2.5
years ago, so I think I coulda just tightened the clamp, but new hose is
always better :-)

[1] BFMI = brute force, massive ignorance :-)
