The thermostat fails in a good way, it just takes longer to warm-up.
Same as a water-cooled engine when the thermostat is removed.
You will know you're good when....
Before you roll to a stop, you will have diagnosed the exact problem,
including the aquisition af necessary parts, tools, repair procedures, and
cost within $10. This will be preceded by the necessary vernacular and
followed by the mental deduction from available funds and current parts
inventory, simultaneously calculated while contemplating how to get home.
The temptation to promise yourself to never get in this situation again
only resurfaces the next time the exact same thing happens.
No point in trying the starter again, but you may try to turn the engine by hand
to verify lock condition to your personal satisfaction ( battery disconnected ).
Then drain the oil into a clean container and remove / inspect the screen.
If you don't find any shrapnel, you have bearings.
Pop the valve covers and look for anything out of place, like a large valve / rocker
clearance or broken pieces which can indicate a broken / bent valve or seat problem.
Since the engine is locked up, you will have to disassemble it until it turns to solve
the problem. With the heads off, most of the answers are obvious.
