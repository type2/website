Subject: Exhaust fumes

Hi All,

I've read the archives on exhaust fumes, esp the posts from a couple of
months ago (JUST before I joined the list).

My '76 twin carb gets fumey when going down hill or backing off the
accelerator.  I think the heater is somehow disconnected, because at the end
of the heat control slider in the front is a z bend in the wire, with
nothing connected to it

>> as an aside, any tips on what to connect this too?  There is also another
cable tucked under the steering column thats got a funny loopy thing on the
end - it desn't seem to move much when I push / pull it, and it doesn't seem
right to connect directly to the heat control <<

back to the fumes, the heater is disconnected, so I suspect its not causing
the fumes.  The engine hatch (both internal and external) seal is fine.  The
engine seal is fine.  The backdoor seal is new aside from about 10" along
the very bottom.  There is a bit of oil in the upper engine bay, and since I
just adjusted the valves the valve cover gaskets are leaking (they were fine
before).  I will fix this very soon.  Other than that it drops a lot of oil
from the oil strainer (I've got a new gasket kit now, but haven't fitted it
yet - again, I'll do it soon).  Of more concern I think there is fuel in the
oil (very very smelly).  I'm trying to pull to fuel pump to replace /
overhaul if possible as I think it is also leaking oil.  I don't quite know
about the exhaust location - it exits where all the others that I've noticed
do - pointing rearward from the rh side of the bus.

i suspect that the problem is related to the fuel in the oil.

The smell clears quickly when accelerating again.

Any thoughts appreciated.
