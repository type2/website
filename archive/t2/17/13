the hydraulic part keeps the pushrod in contact with the cam all the time
so it doesn't "tap" everytime there is an upstroke.  they are preloaded to
match the spring rate of the valves so they "softly" open the valves as
the presure builds.

they are all hydraulic of one sort or another

VW hydraulic don't need adjusting either.
