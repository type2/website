Subject: Re: [T2] Bus snobbery

I think Terry hit the nail on the head.  Its not snobbery.

Much like me while driving in my wife's bmw, the instinct is to wave when
passing an aircooled VW.  Many times I do and get this "Do I know you?"
stare.  More often than less, the confused driver is left wondering, "who
was that" and does not recognize the gesture as one of kinship among
fellow bus owners.  Now if I am going along side and in the same direction
there is more time and usually its a thumbs up followed by a point at the
bus.  That always gets a SMILE.

I drive my DC every day, even on the ones where I might make a quick trip
to the store in the wife's car.  In the last two years of bus driving, I
have NEVER had an EV driver wave. NEVER!  Bay Windows, but no EVers.

It all comes down to camaraderie of driving a similar old vehicle.  I used
to get it with my old Jaguar when it was on the road and I pulled
alongside a Jag of similar vintage.  Newer Jag owners, sh!t, you'd never
catch them waving for a cab.

Next time, try this.  Instead of a friendly wave, try the two step
approach.  First a big thumbs up followed by a point to the bus.  It will
work every time.
