I read and hear over and over again, "previous owner said it was rebuilt 
[insert value that sounds low, but high enough to show oil leaks] miles ago"

Does NO ONE keep receipts for this sort of thing?  Should I honestly believe 
that someone will spend spend between $1000 and $3000 on rebuilds knowing 
that it will add to the value of the car and keep NO records of it?  Hey, you 
have the title and insurance info, where's the rest off the papework?

Am I unrealistic to maintain that no dated records to the contrary can ONLY 
indicate a running used engine/trans that at worst could be the original and 
may sieze next week?

What do all of you do?  Do you typically toss all receipts for repairs over 
$500 because a mumbled reference to them occuring over the last 2 
years/25,000 miles is a more effective way to sell the car?  Is this 
phenomenon unique to the VW world?

I realize careful pre-purchase analysis could indicate otherwise, and yes, it 
can help establish a fair vehicle price.
