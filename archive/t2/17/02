Subject: Sudden Loud Clatter, and then a Dead Engine...

I bought my 75 bus (1.8L FI) at the beginning of the summer and have put 
about 2500 miles on it so far with not more than a few hiccups as I've been 
learning the ropes.  The PO said that a "re-built" engine went in 25,000 
miles ago but other than that I know nothing about this bus's history 
(including whether the odometer has rolled once or more!-it now reads 80k).

Today as I was on a short trip to the beach on back roads going 20-30 mph, 
with no engine noises to signal what was coming, a loud clatter from the 
engine suddenly came on and the engine cut out.  I immediately put the 
clutch in and went to neutral and the clatter stopped, but that was it for 
my beach trip; now if I try to turn the engine over I get only the sound of 
the starter solenoid ??(the click) but no turnover.  I'm towing it home 
tomorrow after which I'll be able to give it a more thorough look.  Can 
anyone venture a guess as to what my problem is, tests I might try to locate 
it, or other friendly advice??  I have tools and manuals, but not a lot of 
experience here…

I couldn't see anything obviously wrong from the outside, though something 
that is probably unrelated did catch my eye: the thermostat ? (spring gizmo 
near the oil pan) has a cable which has broken and is not connected 
anywhere.  There is a pulley wheel above it that I imagine the cable running 
over and then on to its destination: where does this cable go?  Any chance 
this is related to my current situation?

Thanks in advance for any help….
