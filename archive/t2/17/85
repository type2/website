Well, I have replaced ball joints, shocks, steering coupler, and =
steering box on the front of my '70 Westy.  Also have had the front end =
checked by 3 different knowledgeable people and also had it aligned (the =
front end not the people - they were straight to begin with).  She still =
does a slow scary shimmy or actually a float from side to side above 45 =
mph.  So here is what I have left to consider - which maybe I should =
have considered first.
The previous owner installed 205R75/14 passenger tires all around.  This =
seems to make the bus sit higher than it should and puts on some =
flexible side walls.  With the Westy sitting higher maybe this gives it =
that uncontrolled floating once the speed is up a little.  If I can find =
some 185R14 truck tires then maybe this would take care of the float =
since they will be shorter with stiffer sidewalls.  What do you think?  =
I have tried to locate some tires like this with minimal luck.  One =
quote from a local tire store here is for some Bridgestone 607V (I think =
that is right) for about $400 out the door.  Ouch!  Any suggestions =
would be greatly appreciated since this is the last think I can think of =
to correct the front end problem.
