Duncan- 
There is a slight problem with your terminology.
The spring is retained with a "retainer",
a disc about the size of a half-dollar, and the
retainer is held to the spring with two "keepers",
little half-round widgets which keep it from falling off.
Exactly which of these items came out with
the valve cover ?
The spring can be removed from outside the head
with a $10 screw-type valve spring compressor
( Sears, flaps.etc. )
The pushrod should also be removed for examination.
If the valve is bent, the head can be removed
to determine if it can be saved or replaced.
I like to do that job with the engine installed. You may not.
You may have "sucked a guide."
If the bronze valve guide seized to the valve stem,
a potential oversize valve guide repair is still possible.
Thiis will require a professional look by the head repairman:).
You may not have a jack right now, but the savings from
this first repair will more than cover that, and a fine set ot tools.
The major cost of R+R is within your comprehension.
The choice of repair or replace depends on the damage.
A new valve guide is $2 and a new valve is $7.
(Some assembly required:)
