I'm not too sure on actual models, but there are 15" Mercedes rims perfect
for Bay Kombi's. They are quite common here in Australia, and a lot of
Kombi's have them installed. For off road work I have a set of 15"x6.5" Merc
rims with the correct offset (no mods to rim). They allow me to fit
215/75R15 tyres with NO mods to the bus and only just rub the front torsion
bar at full lock, no other clearance issues (I have a '77 bus).
Don't quote me but I believe they're off an E240?? Mercedes. I think
Mercedes in Australia import the cars with steel rims and install factory
mags if requested which means the wreckers here have an abundance of steel
rims.
To overcome the hub cap problem, I fitted hub cap clips from the old 5 stud
VW rims (available at most VW places) to the Merc rims.
