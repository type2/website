Subject: Re:  curious, what is it?

The bezel you are referring to is a european 12 volt accessory outlet.  My 82
Westy has this and I believe that all of them have this outlet.  This thing
drove me crazy until Steve Lashley told me what this was.  He has a catolog
from Germany where you could buy different items that used this outlet.

Now you know!
