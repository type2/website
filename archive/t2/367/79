Subject: cleaning injectors

 I was thinking of getting my injectors cleaned. They've only got 65k miles on them but they've had to ensure sitting in the engine for very long periods of time (82-89, 92-95, 97-02).

I searched the archives and it seemed like a few people have done this with great results since new Bosch injectors are $80 each and cleaning and matching is about $25 per injector.
