Subject: Warming up problem

Hi all,

First post to the list, but been lurking for a while, so hello!

I've got a 1973 Devon Camper with a 1600 dp AD series engine (UK spec) which has a bit of a cold starting problem.  Initially it's fine when starting, but after a few seconds it starts to run a bit rough, and will only just run if I floor the accelerator.  Rpms drop to (I'm guessing) around 500, and the alternator light flashes.  The engine will usually stall about this point, and will start after a number of attempts.

However after a couple of minutes of this (and some choice language) everything sorts itself out.  It idles smoothly and picks up okay.  I've set the points and timing and the carburettor (34PICT-3) seems set fine, so that leaves the choke.....

I've had a dig about the net for information, as my sources of reference (Muir and Haynes) are somewhat lacking in detail on chokes.  I suspect I need to adjust the choke position, as per the the instructions on type2.com, but I have a nagging doubt that something else may be happening here, which I'd like to try and understand before attacking things with spanners.

Anyone with any suggestions?

Cheers
