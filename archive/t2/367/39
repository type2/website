If you're going to be the master mechanic on this thing, get yourself a
reasonable jack.  Although it's nice to have someone to help when you
actually drop the engine, it really isn't necessary.  Sure you can remove
the head without removing the engine, but is it worth it?  I suspect if you
worked really hard at it you could remove your tonsils through your navel,
but most people don't.
