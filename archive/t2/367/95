OK, I looked at that the best I could.
There are two areas that have electrical contact with the cap.  The center 
tab and the end piece on the edge of the rotor.

The area that you have highlighted is in neither place.  It looks the best 
that I can tell is that you have a DEFECTIVE rotor.  It could be one of 
those umph in a lifetime type failures.  Being mis-timed would not cause 
this type of failure.

I'm guessing that the resistance element that is in the rotor, under that 
sealed area, was not adequately connected electrically.  As you started 
applying the high voltage to it, it started heating up and finally burnt 
through the sealant on the top of the rotor.

Just go down to your FLAPS, get a new rotor and you should be back on the 
road (if you haven't already)
No need to "torch" the shop, as I said, it was most likely a manufacturing 
defect.

Out of curiosity,
Did the bus stop running?  How did you happen to look at the rotor?
