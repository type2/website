Subject: vacuum hose

To pick up on Jason's thread...

I just pulled the windshield washer bottle and all of the related tubing to
check for leaks (really to see where the leaks were), and discovered that
there's about 15' of tubing involved.

When I replaced the turn signal switch I noticed that the tubing in the
steering column was shot so I replaced it with new stuff (heavy vacuum line)
and left the ends up under the dash for when I finally got around to the
washer.

I was a little concerned about the connector that I was going to use to hook
the pressurized line from the tank to the line that runs to the valve in the
column.  Will a simple push-on connector hold the pressure without leaking?
I really like the idea of being able to disconnect the tubing for when I
might have to take the column apart.

Thanks.
