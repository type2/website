Subject: Re Dye-ing headrests - had me worried there ;-)

	Richard, Dave, David & Chris, List, et al...

	I'm wondering if the volks who used the SEM products used the
complete assemblage of them for proper dye-ing...

	I purchased the "whole 9 yards" from Eastwood when doing the kewl
kustom kolor interior on my '73 - includes a cleaner, a prep agent, the dye
itself, and clear coat sealer...  Seemed to work very well when used as a
"package" and the direck-shuns were followed to a "U" (1.0 better than a
"T").  The kewl kustom kolors of the interior - "buckskin" (a beige-y color)
for the panels and "camel" (a brown-ish tone) for everything else
non-paneled, looked pretty slick viewed against the exterior beige/cream...
In the long run, it was about half the cost of replacing ALL the panels in
the interior with the appropriate color ones from a vendor.

	Since ya gotta buy the whole kit-n-kabobble to make it work right -
any reason why you just don't buy the appropriate color covers you desire?
IIRC they are not exactly cheap, but how many times to you want to fiddle
around?  OTOH - do the later headrests have replaceable covers?  I'm only
familiar with the earlier ones - if the latter, please don't waste the
bandwidth chastizing me, m'kay?
