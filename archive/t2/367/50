Richard,

I forgot to mention--thatifin fact you choose touse a Dupont Vinyl
die--the body shop supplier who hadles Dupont products usually has a
spectrometer--which will color match any item you can take with you for
them to use as a sample.

This makes for a nice match to the rest of the interior pieces--

SEM, Ditzler, and the Mar-Hyde doesn't offer this service--it's a pot
Lick deal--guess what color your going to get to match the rest of your
interior--:>)

Later,

Terry

headrests
I have a nice pair of brown headrests with soft vinyl. I'd like to dye
them green. What can I do?
