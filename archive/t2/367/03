Camp Jordan. I-75 Exit 1A. Head east, turn left right away. Follow the signs.

Should be fun. Camping available on site (cheap - $5 per adult, kids free).
More than just busses but Type 2s are being showcased this year. 'Drive in'
movie Saturday night (Herbie the Love Bug!). Playground for kids.

If you're just coming for the day, bring a can of food for the Food Bank and
get a discount on admission:
