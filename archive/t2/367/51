Subject: Pop-Top Latches

Hey all-

My Campmobile is a '73, and has the poptop forward and luggage rack aft.  The
PO had put a couple of hasps (like you would use to lock a gate) on the front
corners of the poptop, locking it down to the rain gutter. Unfortunately, she
did a poor job, and made a bit of a mess, and I am thinking of removing them.
My question is this: Are these necessary? Is doing this common? Is there ever
a problem with the poptop "popping" at highway speeds? Has anyone found an
unlocked poptop to be a security risk?

The two metal hooks (on the inside of the poptop, and on the roof) seen to be
engaging. Is it correct that these (and the rubber clip inside the bus at the
back) are all that is supposed to hold down the poptop?

Any thoughts on this from you experts would be appreciated.

Cheers,
Matthew
