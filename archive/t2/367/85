Subject: Reminder: "Love Bug" Campout (May 9-11, North FL US)

Reminder -

Reserve a campsite in the "Dogwood Loop" (I'm in #35) of O'Leno State Park at www.reserveamerica.com for the "Love Bug" campout Friday-
Sunday, May 9-11.  This is a semi-irregular, certified agenda-free event.  Last I checked there were still plenty of sites left.
