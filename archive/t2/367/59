Subject: Pop-Top Latches

I think your 73 is the same as my 71.  So, there should be 3 rubber hold
downs inside the bus - one at the back and one one each side near the front
of the roof opening.  If these are missing, new replacements are available
from many of the list vendors.  What you won't be able to get new will be
the metal brackets at the sides that the rubber hold downs on the sides snap
into.  The rear hold down has a metal hook, which is provided with all of
the new replacements and you must remove the hook when installing the new
hold downs in the side positions.

Does your poptop lay down snug against the roof?  If not, there may be
issues with the front hinges that you should resolve.  I periodically apply
a small amount of white grease to the sliding parts of my pop top hinges, to
keep them moving properly.  Yours could also be bent or need repairs, but
that should not be hard to do.
