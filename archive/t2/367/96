If you are measuring that at the headlights, it's most likely to be the 
CONNECTIONS not the wires.  Loose and/or corroded connections will easily 
result in that voltage drop.

I looked at the ohms per foot for 10ga wire (.001018 ohms) and for 15 feet, 
that's 0.01527 ohms.  Let's double that for the return path, (even though 
we are using the frame for the return) for a total resistance of 0.03054 ohms.

Now  0.03054 ohms * 20 amps = 0.611 Volts
but I think that a more reasonable number for current is 5 amps per lamp 
(I'm sure others will correct me) which would put the voltage drop at half 
the above number (0.3 volts)
So, anyway you slice it (5 amps or 10 amps per lamp), most of your drop 
looks to be coming from the connections.
