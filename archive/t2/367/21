Subject: Re: [T2] ordered tires...interesting

I've ordered from Tire Rack on 4 occasions. I like dealing with them better 
than most of the local tire stores because their info is spot on.

Everytime $16 per tire shipping (give or take $1 or so). That's from 
Indiana to Tennessee.

I've shopped with them b/c I wanted something better than Wal-Mart tires 
and something cheaper than gold plated specialty tires from the local tire 
store. I have several local tire store to choose from - choose any two - 
fast, cheap, good. Never all three... <grin>

I've bought Pirelli tires for my Hondas I could not get in my small town. 
Was cheaper through Tire Rack than ordering them locally. The local guys 
are ordering from tire distributors in Nashville and then marking them up 
for their trouble.
