I've bought online from TireRack and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Look for their ads in magazine as you can get a really great deal on close-outs. I bought OEM Yokohamas for my wife's car for $35 and the first set lasted forever. I took them into Discount Tire (same company?) for mounting and once I got past all the salesmanship (rims, chrome tire valves) and warranty pressure I found they did a great job. I didn't get the warranty, got a flat and they still plugged it for free. This even happened a second time and they fixed it for free. That place is always busy for a good reason.

I also bought my CR21's from Discount Tire (America's Tire). I was charged shipping because it was a special order but that was expected.

I'm still not clear when their prices include mounting and balancing...except for that confusion they'll continue to have my business.
