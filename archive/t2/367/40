Subject: Re: Oil Strainer?

I usually clean and inspect the strainer and put in new gaskets every second
or third oil change. I started out doing it every time but didn't find
anything to worry me, so I extended the schedule. You can bet that the first
time I find troubling debris in there I'll go back to checking it every
change.

read the strainer isn't as fine mesh as the original anyway. I think you'll
find people on either side of the fence on this issue. Personally, I like to
know what's inside.
