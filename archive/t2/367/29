I threw away a pair of these last year. They were bought in Canada and were left new on the rims for over 20 years. List advice at the time said the were too dangerous to use.

Before I threw them away, I recorded the sidewall info to help others find an equivalent tire. Most interesting is the load rating, Nemo's 1540 lbs minimum.
