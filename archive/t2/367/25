Bill,

Leave the heater off on one trip and see what happens....surely
it is warm enough up in the boston area for that now!

Open up the pipe going up the center of the underneath and run your
vacuum cleaner up there(shop vac better).

I had this problem with smelling exhaust and finally located
it by making damn sure that my heater system was sealed like it was 
supposed to be and all muffler clamps really were tight and sealing 
everything.

Then disconnected one heater box and ran only the other one...figured out 
that it was the passenger side which was cracked someplace internally.
I actually disconnected and sealed the hose from the heat exchanger to 
make absolutely sure *nothing* could get through....then switched to the 
other side.


Replaced it and end of problem...

Keep your self and the car in one piece and fix this one soonest!

Cheers, dave
