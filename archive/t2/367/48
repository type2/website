Richard,
Dupont has an excellent vinyl die--as does Mar-Hyde.
Available at any finer auto body supply.

I can vouch for the Dupont product-- dyed a pair of grenn headrests--to
Clementine orange--
The most important trick is make sure they are super clean--and scuffed
down good to give the material some "tooth" to bind to the vinyl--

Have Fun--

Terry

headrests
I have a nice pair of brown headrests with soft vinyl. I'd like to dye
them green. What can I do?
