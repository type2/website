Subject: Re: [T2] booster fan fuse

Here's the problem I found with the booster fan: It gets its power thru the 
ignition switch, shares its power with the coil, and thus is close to the 
point of overload whenever you switch it on. The coil itself draws a lot of 
amps thru a very, very long run of old wiring from the starter to the ign. 
switch, via a very long (and too small a gauge, IMNSHO) run of main feed wire 
from the starter. The ign. switch ALSO is the main feed for your lights. Too 
much power being asked to go too many places thru too small a wire. Easy fix: 
Power the ign. coil itself via an engine compartment mounted relay, as I've 
done with mine. Put your headlights on separate relays also, all with their 
own correct sized wire gauge. In other words, take as much of the vehicles 
electrical load away from the ignition switch, and use fused, separately 
powered relays instead. You will not believe the difference it makes. If 
you've got a volt gauge hooked up, you will find that the voltage drop is 
suddenly almost nil. The windshield wipers move faster, the headlights are 
brighter, and you get hotter spark. The old wiring system was marginal at 
best when brand new. Now, it just sucks/blows. Power and fuses, that is!
