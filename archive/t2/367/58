Subject: Re: [T2] Pop-Top Latches

Hi Matthew,

I have had a 72 and 73 westy, and now have a 74 roof on my Westfakia. I 
have seen that Westfalia used a lot of different latching mechanisms 
over the years from 74-79, but the earlier buses were pretty similar 
from what I've seen.

With the 73 being hinged at the front there is not much risk of it 
popping up. But at highway speeds the low pressure area above the roof 
does pull the fibreglass upwards against the hinges, which will 
sometimes break the seal between the pop-top and the vehicle, even with 
the hooks installed. This will lead to road dirt and debris 
accumulating on the front canvas during long road trips.

Inside the pop-top the early (68-73) westy uses a pair of rubber 
tied-downs to secure the rear end of the roof. These are sometimes 
broken off but can be easily replaced at minimal cost through online 
vendors like Busdepot.

If it were mine, I would remove the hasps. Unless they are HUGE, they 
probably won't hold up to the stress, and if they are huge they will be 
very ugly. Installing a new seal on the pop-top might be a better 
answer. Check that the front catches are working correctly and that 
there is not too much play in the front hinges.

Security risk? No more so than any other part of the bus. If you have 
someone *that* determined to get into your vehicle they are going to do 
it; I even heard of one locked out bus owner climbing in through the 
rear engine hatch once upon a time. Never met him, he must have been a 
lot skinnier and/or flexible than I am. But the windows are just glass, 
so a determined invader or thief is not going to have trouble getting 
in if they really want to.

Happy trails,
