Subject: ignition problems no spark

So I checked the coil and I am getting 12+V on the
positive side and on the negative side 12 before I
start cranking, then 10.4 after, but the negative side
is not jumping up and down (which I am told it is
supposed to do), also, there is 12V to the distributor
cap from the coil which is constant (i think it is
supposed to be intermitent?) and no spark will jump if
I pull the cap wire off slightly.  I am getting
absolutely nothing in terms of voltage at any of the
spark plug wire terminals on the distributor cap. 
Anyone have any suggestions on loose wires or which
piece in the system is malfunctioning?  All this stuff
worked fine when just before my engine died about a
month ago.
