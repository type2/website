>I've got a 1973 Devon Camper with a 1600 dp AD series engine (UK spec) which has a bit of a cold starting problem.  Initially it's fine when starting, 
but after a few seconds it starts to run a bit rough, and will only just run if I floor the accelerator.  Rpms drop to (I'm guessing) around 500, and the 
alternator light flashes.  The engine will usually stall about this point, and will start after a number of attempts.

>However after a couple of minutes of this (and some choice language) everything sorts itself out.  It idles smoothly and picks up okay.  I've set the 
points and timing and the carburettor (34PICT-3) seems set fine, so that leaves the choke.....

My 1600 single port does this.  AFAIK the choke and timing are fine.  I suspect a blocked manifold heat riser, which I'm going to roto-rooter next time I 
have the engine out.
