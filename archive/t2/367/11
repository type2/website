Hi List,

All the talk of poptop woes got me thinking about my poptop.  About halfway
through last summer the poptop on our '72 westy (pops forward) does not seem
to close down all the way in the front.  The seal around the sides is fully
closed but there is a 1.5 inch opening where the seal does not come down to
the metal in the front, above the window.  There seems to be some sort of
hinge there in the front, but cant tell how the hinge should seat.  Perhaps
my hinge is "sprung"  or aligned improperly?   Any thoughts on how to
realign it?

Thanks,
Ed

One of them did not work, the wire that wraps around that bend was missing.
I replaced it though, and it still does the same thing. Maybe I should just
take both of the braces off and see if I can latch it down tight without
them in place once. From what I remember, they were a real B8tch to remove
though. I don't remeber why, but im sure I will soon enougn.

Yes, mine just latches in the center, and that is all.
