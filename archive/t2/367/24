Andrew,

Sounds like your points are dead.  Got a dwell meter?

Was the distributor seated all the way down...did you try
wiggling the rotor?

Pop the cap off and turn the engine over...does the rotor
rotate???<grin>

If it does rotate, then probably points or coil....more than likely 
points...maybe you fried them?...condensor?

Points look ok?  gapped ok?  Bet they are not good!


Cheers, dave
