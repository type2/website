Busdrivers,

Throughout the day yesterday the bus was losing power off the line.  Started
with a lag when shifting from 1 to 2.  By the time it was time to drive to
school, power had subsided such that I had to ditch it in a parking lot and
continue on foot.

After class there was hot coffee and newspaper reading in the cold
while waiting for AAA.

The symptoms are compatible with a fuel-filter clog, but I just changed it a
few weeks ago.  I have another new one on deck that I'll swap in tonight,
but I'm wondering if anyone wants to throw out some other possibilities.
Pressure was tested last filter change so I don't suspect the pump.

79 California version, all stock.  Engine idles fine, haven't tweaked
anything in years, Remanufactured AFM.

Thanks,

Billy
M'boro, TN
