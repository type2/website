hey  Guys  Thank You  I plan to keep it that way. Being in this   bus. since 
1980 and yes you will not please everybody. I have been sued a  couple  of 
times 
but won both cases when I proved that they were  wrong .   Mark I admit not 
trying hard enough to prove my side(or  was it I was to busy with customers 
cars to deal with lies) 
 
 

I work  hard it  having 
a great following among  the VW group and really  enjoy camping  with the 
full 
moon bunch and  do the tech class  at High Country for the  last 5 years, 
which by the way we haven't  seen Mario since about April. I am  sure he has 
a good  
reason. 
 

Mark  I just got married and I'm still swamped at the shop but  will be 
takeing on new help soon, that and my 67 has been down for slow  repair work...lol
