hey john  Everybody on type2 and the samba know the story on Mario.  What it 
shows is that not every bus driver knows about the lists. I  make  it a point

educate them. I guess every now and then we need to bring up some bad  so 
that the new people are aware of it. It seems mario is still lurking even thu  he 
thinks we are all morons LOL  Later  Mark  Dearing
