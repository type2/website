Subject: Bugpack Header and Single Quiet Pack Combo for 77?

cip offers these at pretty attractive prices, and to replace a muffler is MUCH cheaper than the ones I've been buying at 170 each Canadian. Has anyone run these?

I can buy 3 Bugpack Single Quiet Pack mufflers for the price of one of the usual.

 Would appreciate any info from people who have run them as to sound, longevity, any damage to engine due to restrictiveness etc.
Thanks,
Courtney
