hey Mike.  I replaced my torsion arms this Summer.  If you're following
the Mike Gensler removal steps (Library under Ball Joint replacement),
we're talking about step 11, right?  If you haven't seen this article,
you'll probably find it really helpful.  I found that a 3-arm puller
from Harbor Freight ($10) seperated the ball joint from the knuckle
without too much trouble.  The hardest part is getting the 3rd arm
hooked on there.  I didn't try a 2 armed prong-style.  Maybe others
have had good luck with one of them.

So long as your front end is in pieces, this might be a good time to
consider replacing the ball joints, upgrading your swaybar and/or
replacing/repacking your front wheel bearings.

Good luck and let us know how it goes
