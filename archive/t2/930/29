Yup, $40, but hey, it's better than the "eaten in half by the fan
pulley" one I have in my spare parts bin now.   Can't time my bus
reliably unless I go borrow one from the repair shop, and they're very
picky about lending it out.  

I just file it under "Things I'll only have to buy once for the bus".
