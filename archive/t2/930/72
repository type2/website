Subject: Optimal Exhaust For 78

I need to replace the muffler on the 78' westy. I got a http://www.busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=352000 which is what had been on the bus. It was a real beast to install as the flanges did not line up very well and I had to tweak my heat exchangers and elbows to get it together and even then it was not a great fit and not that quiet. Not looking to bash BD here I think I may have just gotten a bad unit and well its been on there a year now so I hardly have room to bitch. I would like a quiet exhaust that is decent quality and as free flow as possible. I have considered converting to the 72-74 style but did not really relish the expense of new heat exchangers. Also my current exchangers and elbows are in pretty good shape. I would like to get a new muffler like the one from BD above but am looking for a better and quieter one, maybe a quietpack or monza style, but not one thats gonna rust out in a week. Any thoughts?
