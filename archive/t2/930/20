Yes... <sigh>  I have seen sooo many combinations of that ... it is very 
hard to generalize or predict which cyl / valve it will happen to.

The personal experience I have showed less damage to the head, <not much 
mind you> which I drove 5500 kms from the time it dropped to the day I 
pulled it. Every morning I adjusted the valve about 10 thou,,,, in all it 
sunk about 300 thou which was very visibible at the valve stems.
here is a general picture ,, you can see the one valve spring is a lot 
higher than the other 3,,  they should all be level.

Thankfully it really didn't ruin the vacation.... in fact , I think it 
becomes a conversation topic a lot more!
