Subject: Re: [T2] Optimal Exhaust For 78

You have a pretty loooooooong Westy... 78 ft !  ??

Just to stop from driving the list nuts.. I would suggest you use '78  as 
the short form of 1978
and 78' meaning... 78 ft

It drives parts guys nuts when you call it a westy as well... it is a 
Volkswagen..lol
the muffler is volkswagen.... not westfalia ...... in '78,,, Westfalia 
converted other than just VW's to campers you know ! <grin>

lol ... I am leaving!
