Subject: Single port to Dual port?

I'm in the process of putting together parts for the rebuild of my '70
westie with the single port 1600cc...

I plan on converting to dual port heads ( with dual solex configuration ) in
the process, aside from the heads and intake manifolds, do I need to replace
the cooling tin with a newer style?

Cheers
