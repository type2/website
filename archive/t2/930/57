Subject: Re: [T2] Single port to Dual port?

George,

Is there any special technique for brazing? I mean do you just flow material 
around the cracks or is reinforcing material required?

Thanks,
Phil

 Get used German tin if you can.  Repro stuff can be hard to fit.  Dual
 port tin also tends to crack, so have any cracks brazed up before you
 install it.  Once brazed, it remains crack-free.
