i concur with the above, and will add some to it.

the upper rubber stops are almost always in need of replacement,  
unless you are in a very dry climate. they rust and the clips that  
hold them also rust. the upper stops need to be removed to re and re  
the upper arms.  the sway bar clamps will also need to be replaced in  
most cases, they are difficult to re-use.
