Oh yeah... I forgot about the upper snubbers.  My clips were rusted on
(PB Blaster to the rescue), and I got my replacement clips... from you
:)  Like you said, they gotta come out to get your upper torsion arms
out and back in again.  Mind the springs when you put your arms back
in.  If they aren't aligned in a square, the arms won't go all the way
in no matter how hard you try.
I can't say enough about how much nicer the drive is with the upgraded
swaybar.  RAtwell dot com has a bunch of text on this that sold me on
the upgrade.  Driving at highway speeds in tire ruts with one hand is a
true luxury.
