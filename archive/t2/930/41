You'll also need to replace the upper two head studs in the center of 
the cylinder
banks -- the singleport studs are too long for the dualport heads.

Don't use one of those godawful stud-removal tools that grab the 
threads to get
them out.  Put two nuts down the threads, tighten the nuts against each 
other
and use a wrench on the inner nut to back the stud out.  If  that 
doesn't get them,
try vicegrips on the unthreaded part of the stud  (though that requires 
taking the
cylinders off...)
