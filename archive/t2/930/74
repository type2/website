Subject: RE: [T2] Optimal Exhaust For 78

Ted,

Have a good muffler shop fab you up one with your requirements. They have a
large stash of high-quality elbows, fittings and muffler components to fit
together a rust-free, non-leaky, quiet muffler. If they do it in stainless,
your heater boxes will rust out before your muffler looks dirty.

Or, you could buy a monza or eliminator style and have it Ceramic Powder
Coated to extend the life as long as possible. To keep the noise and leaks
down, only use high-quality metal type gaskets.

In Ron's defense, he can only sell what is available and doesn't do the
fabrication himself. Most aftermarket parts have to be tweaked a little,
some a lot.
