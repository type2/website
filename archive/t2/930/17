Subject: re-refined oil

	Re-refining is the best thing to do with used oil which 
otherwise becomes a pollutant of one sort or more.  For a 
half-century, the main bus line in my region used re-refined oil. 
Results were very good.  For a couple decades I followed this lead  - 
saving money and, I believe, engine wear.
	The NZ re-refinery was then bought up by BP Oil and, after 
some more years, quietly shut down.
	All experts I've consulted agree that re-refined oil is at 
least as good as new oil.  (For one, I'm fortunate enough to have a 
former student who works for a big oil company.)  Minor components in 
new oil contain double bonds (R-CH=CH-R') which are broken by 
oxidation in the first 'run' in an engine, producing acids (R-COOH + 
HOOC-R') which cause minor harm; these acids are easily removed in 
re-refining.  The re-refined mixture of hydrocarbons is therefore 
better than what was originally distilled from crude oil.
	The oil proper is then mixed with additives to make the stuff 
you buy.  There are few if any secrets about additives  -  as witness 
Castrol & other oil mfrs at least as capable as BP, Shell etc.  (The 
final multigrade e.g 20W-50 is little more than half oil  -  c.40% 
additives against oxidation etc and to provide the multigrade 
properties.)
	I would be interested in what re-refining still continues, 
and in any bodies of experience with re-refined oils (not only sump 
but also transmission).
