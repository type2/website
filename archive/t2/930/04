This can also quite a good thing for those of us with early bays and
broken fuel gauges/senders.

If I couldn't see how much or little gas I have in my tank through the
filler neck I'm sure I'd end up out of gas on many occasions. Now I
will always wonder exactly how much gas is left in the tank past the
point at which I can see it, but at least I know it's about time for
more.
