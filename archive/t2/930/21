Subject: torsion arm removal

Hi everyone - I'm tearing down my first front beam to get repaired and
painted.  I'm about to remove the spindles and wasn't sure on to get the upper
and lower torsion arms out of the spindle (knuckle).  Any help here would be
appreciated.  I'm not sure if I have to separate the ball the joints first.
Also, when installing the arms do they go in a certain way??

Thanks=20
