The not taking a charge overnight should be a good indication that the
battery 
is AMF.


<< Or should I have to run the bus much longer to get the battery
charged up from zero.>>

If the charger wouldn't do it--the alternator sure isn't going to.

Unzip the mattress and buy a new one.

if you had the battery on a tender--it would probably still be OK.
Leaving them in a vehicle uncharged, unattended, and forgotten is a
no-no.
