That touches a nerve here.

I just finished fabricating and installing a bulkhead to cover the  
hole some PO put in my bus.

ARGH!  Why someone would chop a hole in a bus to fix a non-fatal  
problem is beyond me; I mean, jeeze, you _can_ drive a vehicle  
without a working fuel guage.

I am a reformed gas thief though.  Yes, it was wrong, but in High  
school a friend and I used to take gas from whatever car was parked  
next to us in the school parking lot.  The funny thing is that we  
were taking gas from all sorts of cars and putting it into a Bus!
