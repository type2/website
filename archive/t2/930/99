Like your daughter I went to college for knowledge, to learn from those  that 
have experienced something  prior in life, I consider  Mark  a very 
knowledgeable person and value his opinion and will ask his advice to  make sure I'm 
doing right by my customers. I'm always willing to learn as much  as I can from 
people like him.
