Subject: Body Shop Referral Needed Maryland

I used to be active on this list a few years ago and have been out of the loop making money, having kids,  and racing sailboats, but winter is here and I'm ready to get serious about Possum's body work. I have a 78' Champagne westy that mechanically is great but needs a good body shop to get her cosmetics done. Surface rust in spots, no cancer, few dings here and there ect. Surface rust inside the air intake vents in the rear for engine air. How do you get to that stuff? Anyway I am looking to strip the bus myself mechanically of glass, doors, bumpers, lights, interior, pop top. Basically get it down to a rolling shell ready for body work but dont really know any decent shops. I live in Annapolis but dont mind travelling with in reason. In the past you guys were a huge help so any references would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks,
