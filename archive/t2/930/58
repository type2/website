Subject: Re: Fw: [T2] The Saga of Mario Gavazzi comes to a head?

Well if you choose not to go into it nor do you defend yourself against a
possibly libelous website so be it. The half of the story everyone knows will
be the one that's at the top of Googles search results for your name and your
business. Sorry to tell you but what's true doesn't really matter in this
world if hardly anyone knows about it...

  I'm not going to get into it in this group,  I have been providing the best
service for a large # of people and will continue to do so regardless of a few
people that have problems with me or my business.

  Like most your missing the facts and making judgment based on half the
story.

  Sorry to tell you this but everything you read in the rag magazines isn't
true.
