well since none of these dealers actually make the mufflers can't blame
them.  I don't think I've gotten a muffler that has actually "fit" without
hassles since the one that came on the bus...  seems a sawzall and welder
is required to get a decent fit

I got one of the SS mufflers that BD was selling a few years back and the
good news/bad news about that muffler.  the good news is that it still
looks like new and has not degraded any significant amount.

the bad news.  the tailpipe flange was welded on wrong and had to cut the
tailpipe near the flange rotate it about 45degrees and reweld it, and all
the mounting brackets and flanges are mild steel and have rusted pretty
badly would never get it apart would have to cut it off.

all in all it has been a good buy but could have been much bettter for an
extra $10 and a little care.
