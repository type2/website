Subject: More gas heater questions.  Must be getting cold.

How did a VW 411/412 gas heater mount?  Would it be adaptable to a bus as a supplemental heater?
I've seen pictures of them, but never seen one in person.  What was the model number?
I have a BN6 in my '78 Westy, and I have a couple of Thing heaters (BN4s?) and I am thinking of installing a gas heater of some type for a supplemental heater/defroster in the '77 7 passenger Bus that I recently bought.
The BN 6 looks very complicated to install (and I don't have an extra one) and the Thing heaters don't look sealed up enough to mount underneath the bus (like the BN6) where it would be easier to tie into the heat tube.
Were the type 4 heaters mounted under the car like the BN6s, or were they in a protected area like the Thing heaters?  Are they sealed well enough to be mounted underneath the bus like a BN6?
I know that there are other options, but I would like to mount in an area that would minimize the amount of cutting holes in the bus (ideally underneath), and I don't want to mount anywhere inside the passenger compartment.  The engine compartment is a possibility, too, but it would be harder to tie into the heat ducts that way.
Any thoughts?
