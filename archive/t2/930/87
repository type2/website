Subject: Horn decided to start honking at the police today. :-)

So I'm driving down the hill near by house with an RCMP officer behind me, when all of a sudden my horn starts intermittently honking all by itself. It had previously not been honking half the time when I pushed on the horn button, so I was surprised when it decided to alert the police by honking. I pulled over, as did the mountie and he laughed when I told him the story.
(It's Friday so thought I'd add some entertainment). 
So my question is, where is the short most likely to be? I think it's probably in the horn wire that is in the steering column?? Does this require completely removing the steering column assembly to fix it? Retiring minds want to know. :-)
Thanks and have a good weekend,
Courtney
