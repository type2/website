Old-timey aircraft had a fuel cap with a 2" vertical tube coming out of
it.  A bent wire with a cork on the end extended up through the vertical
tube.  The cork floated on the fuel and the height of the bent end told
the fuel level.  When the bend in the wire got close to the tube it was
time to land.  The tube also served as the fuel vent.

The idea could be adapted to a bus, but it would get in the way of a lot
of luggage!
