I have a rather cheap ($50) radio/cassette player for
my dash, but a decent 10 disk CD changer to play a
better variety of music for myself.  What I do to keep
it hidden is to hide it in my rear facing seat in my
71 Westy.  The only way they can get it out is to
remove the seat completely as it was the only way to
put it in.
Since I took the seat out of my 70, I had the perfect
time to mount it before it went into the 71.
  Westies have some of the best hiding places for CD
changers.  You could even mount your radio in an
awkward place like that too, but you couldn't change
the station very often.  I have seen ones mounted in
the headbanger shelf above the bed or in the side of
the closet. Yes the radio, not just the speakers.
  Just a thought for those who are strange enough to
do it.
