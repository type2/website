its most familiar old use was in older westfalias and it had the portable cone light 
that plugged into the socket.
i got both ends of the adapter while i was in germany and terry and jim had 
enlightened another group before about the john deere option.  you can then wire any 
accessory to a plug and use it. i hadn't seen it before on bay windows glad to know 
they kept the idea.
