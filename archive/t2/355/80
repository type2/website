Subject: Pining for EveryBus!

This is the first year that we are not at EB and it seems very strange. 
 Just dropping a line to say (if anyone has laptop!) that we are with 
you in spirit and should be there in person for the next one.  My bus is 
almost up and running and my very pregnant sister should deliver her 
first baby soon; these were the two things that factored into our not 
coming this year.  My kids ask about "the Bus Camp"; I assure them it 
will be there next year.  Have fun!  Beth, Jon, Schuyler and Paige in NJ
