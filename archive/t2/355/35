Last night I talked to a place in Los Alamitos, CA
(south LA/north OC border) abouth baltic birch and he
said he carried it in the 5x5 sheets but not in the
1/8th inch we need.  When I told him about our need in
the VW bus world for such stuff he said he was quite
interested but wanted to see the interest out there
for the stuff a little closer for those of us on the
coast than the other wood store that sells it out in
Corona.  Anyway, the place is called Good Woods and
the guy I talked to there sounded like a real nice guy
so I'm stopping by his business tonight on the way
home to see what all he has over at the store.
