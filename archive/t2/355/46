Go to any John Deere dealer--or BMW motorcycle dealer--they have
them--the socket as well as the plug--

John Deere being the less expensive--I think it is about 7 bucks.

Does anyone know more about the silver socket in the Westfalia dash?
I've been trying to find out more about it for a while but only found
one person mentioned on a website and I've been unable to contact him.
One popped up on eBay recently:

Does anyone have any info on it?
