Hey Guys, Sorry to say that I won`t be making it to Everybus. I was only 50 miles into my trip when it shut off. The one thing I didn`t have with me. A fuel pump. I didn`t have a spare yesterday when I was packing up and my local vw garage didn`t have one either. That figures. There is nothing like being on the side of the road at 4:00 am. I hope everyone has a good time! Maybe next year.
