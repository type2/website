this is a common occurrence. the VDO sender is different than the stock oil
pressure switch.

the VDO sender will light the idiot light at anything below 11 psi. the
stock sender lights the light from 3-6 psi.

put the gauge on and you will see for sure what is going on. i don't know
about calibrating the VDO sender.
