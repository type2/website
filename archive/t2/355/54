Marcus,

Need more information.
I for one believe that it *might* be ignition related.

To reiterate.  

Not running well at idle(up to 2500 rpm?)
Identify cylinder(s) not firing and at the same time put a timing
light on the spark plug wires toward the spark plug end.
Still getting fire to the plug?...for sure?

New plugs?  My father once had this type problem in a ch**y engine and we
spent nearly $300 to get it "diagnosed" and repaired...still did the same
thing after we got it back.

Turns out that he had cleaned the plugs(cause 40,000 miles seemed like too 
much) with **WD40**.  The wd40 "poisioned" the ceramic on the plugs so
that they actually conducted at certain rpm's and loads.....think about 
that for a few minutes.

Found this out after going to local flaps and while counterman is getting 
me new plugs I mention this....counterman says...ahaaaa!  New plugs will 
fix it...and they did!

Think about what you may or may not have done to the engine that might 
have helped cause this.

Buy bad gas?  Got water in gas?
Everything is suspect!


Cheers, dave
