LOL!  We have sure gotten to be a bunch of paranoid folks!<grin>

Ok, my final say on this thread...a cell phone "embeded" somewhere safe
that calls you when the bus is(take your pick,one or more):

Touched
Moved
door opened
started
shifted

Oh...and BTW it would have one of those new GPS funtions built in that 
also gives you it's co-ordinates when you call it back and it answers....

*then* you know what is going on....

So, for about $400 + monthly cell costs, I can build one for anyone that 
wants it....<VBG>....

Cheers, dave
