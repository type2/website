Yes, that is the bottom of the tank you can see.

Since your bus used to be fuel injected this plugged line used to connect to
the fuel pressure regulator by the 1/2 fuel rail.

The nipples are part of the tank:

If you can't see it's wet where the hose attaches then you've got a leak
somewhere inside the tank bay. It could be the breather hoses when you
overfill, or the rubber hose that connects the fuel filler pipe to the tank
opening. I doubt it's coming from the top where the sender is.
