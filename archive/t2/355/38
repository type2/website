Subject: hiccup...thanks!

I joined the list a couple weeks ago almost ready to sell my bus...It had 
been running terribly...started fine but after it warmed up it would buck & 
"hiccup" & try to die...coaxed on only by crafty acceleration techniques.  I 
had ben told by a "VW pro" brother of a friend that this was due to the fact 
that most of the driving I do is very short distance...10 minutes or so & as 
a result I never let the engin get fully warmed up.  He said it would ONLY 
be fixed by long drives with fuel cleaner.

Someone on the list had posted a similar problem & about 5 people had the 
same answer...replace the $5.00 fuel filter.  I did...it worked splendedly!  
Thank you!  My question now is:  Is there ANY validity to what I was told?  
I do go on occasional camping trips & long drives but most are short local 
trips.
