"this is the kind of thing i would search for used first (if you
already haven't)."

I have to disagree here...  The plastic bits inside of these decay over
time and use, so in my opinion you're better off buying one new and
never having to mess with it for the rest of your life.  ;-)  I don't
like pulling the dash apart.

$45 seems like a pretty good price to me, I payed something like $65 for
one for my '72 a few years back.
