Hi,

I just came back to the house to pick Stella up from school early. I 
can report quite at start to EB this year. When I went to bed last 
night there were already over thirty buses and when I woke up this 
morning another ten where in the campground. More are pouring in 
every hour. So far everyone is having a great time.

Hope to see you soon!
