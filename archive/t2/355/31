Ok, what this says to me is you can identify which cylinder is cutting out 
by pulling each plug wire independently. There will be no RPM change on the 
bad cylinder. I would test the HT wires for resistance. Then check that 
plug. Then inspect the dizzy cap for a crack.

Know that if it is a single cylinder dropping out, it has to be spark, 
because each carb feeds two cylinders and if it were a carb issue, two 
cylinders would both have the same problem. If you let it idle for a few 
minutes on 3 cylinders, you should surely be able to see which plug is wet 
from not firing.

You are very high here. Either the motor was built with a very high 
compression ratio or you have a heavy build up of carbon in the combustion 
chambers. I would sure be looking for any carbon fouling of the plugs. What 
weight of oil have you been using??? How black does the oil get before 
changing???
