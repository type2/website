Subject: Oil pressure relocation - VDO kit - results

I asked around quite a bit. The VDO kit has been discontinued and all
the major suppliers are out of stock. However, Dave pointed me to John
at aircooled.net. John does not have any right now either, but he has
stainless hoses made. Should be back in stock in a few weeks. It seems
as he is the only supplier for these right now. $19.99 for the kit.

BTW, the thread it 10mm which is very close to 1/8-27 but not the same.
