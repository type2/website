Found this on the net:
A simpler and much cheaper Bosch accessory socket is available from John
Deere dealers for about $9. In fact John Deere apparently has two female
sockets available, with the AL25073 part being mostly plastic and cheaper ,
while the MG82002966 part is made with more metal and appears to be more
durable. I've used the AL25073, and it's Ok, but just Ok. The Hella female
socket (in my experience) grips the male part much more securely than the
John Deere / Bosch AL25073 does.

John Deere part numbers:

Female socket: MG82002966
Female socket: AL25073
Male plug: RE11344
