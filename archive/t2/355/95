Subject: Fuel Leak

Had my first real scare with Giacomo today.

Filled the fuel tank up to the top for the first time, and was shocked to
find gas coming out from under the bus.  When it finally stopped, I slide
under the bus to find that the fuel had apparently from a square hole under
the fuel tank where two nipples stick out.  One nipple is fuel-lined to the
carb, but the other is about 8" long and plugged with a bolt and clamp!

The nipple facing toward the rear of the bus has the plugged line on it.
The nipple facing forward has the line running to the carb.  The fuel
appears to have come from the edge of the hole in the body that exposes the
nipples (I'm assuming that the nipples are actually attached to the bottom
of the fuel tank).

Okay.  From what I've read here, the problem is probably the seal between
the metal fuel filler pipe and where it attaches to the tank.  Sound right?

For now, I'm going to siphon 5-gallons of fuel out of the tank into a jerry
can, and not fill the tank up to the top until I can fix whatever's wrong
with it.  Until this point we've never had fuel fumes in or around the bus.

BTW, I carefully drove the bus home from the gas station without a disaster
occurring (we prayed!)  While there was some fuel fumes after turning or
getting over a sharp incline, we could not see any liquid fuel escaping
whenever we stopped to check.

Really scary stuff!
