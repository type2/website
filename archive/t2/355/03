Hi Folks,

There is a solution beyond the VDO part, and it's a lot cheaper.  I used a 
grease gun extension hose and grounded the sender to the engine tin with a 
hose clamp.  The threads on the hose are the same as the sender, so it 
threads right in.  Thread it into the case, and use a female/female pipe 
connector to get the sender threaded onto the end of the hose.  Then, put a 
hose clamp around the sender, and cinch it tight so there's about an inch of 
hose clamp left over.  Finally, thread a screw thru the hose clamp and into 
the engine tin to create a ground.

This solution cost me about $7.50 by using parts from my local FLAPS.  It 
works just as well as the VDO system, and it's a lot cheaper.

As always, YMMV.  Good luck!
