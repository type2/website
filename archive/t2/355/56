Subject: Baltic Birch from Hardwood Store at Everybus

Hey - Is anyone interested in swinging by the Hardwood Store on their way to
Everybus (it's outside of Greensboro) and picking up some Baltic Birch to
resell at Everybus? According to their website, it's $18/sheet (5x5) in 3+
quantity.

I'd gladly give $25/sheet for two sheets to anyone willing to do the run. As I
would bet others would be just as excited to get fresh sheets without having
to pay for shipping ($$$$$).

I'm not leaving Chattanooga for a couple more. They are open Saturday morning
- I may make a run if no one else does.
