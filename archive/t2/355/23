Subject: Re: 74 bus basically no idle

List,

I haven't gotten much further - bus still runs like crap ... 

I plugged the brake booster port and put a clamp on the balance tube
grommet on the left carb side because it felt a bit loose. Bus still
runs like crap. I sprayed starter fluid around the carbs but could not
note any differences in idle speed. BTW, the carbs are Solex 36-40
PDSIT.

Next, I pulled the dizzy vacuum line (I know this is ported and not
manifold vacuum). Below 2500 RPM vacuum fluctuates like crazy around
7-11". Around 2500 RPM one more cylinder kicks in, RPMs jump up and I
get a nice steady reading of 12" and a nice running engine. But 2500 RPM
ist not necessarily my preferred idle speed ...

It seems that around 2500 RPM the missing cylinder kicks in, then
without change in throttle RPM go up to about 3000.

Ignition has been ruled out and my compression readings do not seem to
indicate major cylinder or valve issues. Here are the readings:

Dry	wet
160	190
185	225
155	200
180	185

I was not too good at measuring the oil that went in, so there may be
significant variations between the cylinders with respect to the amount
of oil that went in. Not sure whether that would make much difference,
anyway.

Any ideas? 

Marcus
