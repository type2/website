yep--and a quart of yellow for your  roof,bumpers, and wheels--

What a color combo on a bus--Zowie---:>(

The amazing thing is that BMW bikes are still using this same set up--
I have two of them on the bike--one up below the gauges, just above the
bars--and the other down below the L/H side of the seat for my electric
vest--
Why can't they get current with the rest of the world???

Later,

Terry
