Haven't heard much chatter about this weekend coming
up, is anyone going, am I going to be all alone,
sob,sob. I'll see all of you there. Don't let a little
rain stop you. I got duct tape just in case my Westy
springs a leak and some corn for my sore back. I hope
there will be someone there that can show me how to
light my refer, all I can get mine to do is go "Poof".
