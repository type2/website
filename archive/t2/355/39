Subject: Silver socket

Does anyone know more about the silver socket in the Westfalia dash? I've
been trying to find out more about it for a while but only found one person
mentioned on a website and I've been unable to contact him.

One popped up on eBay recently:

rd=1

Does anyone have any info on it?
