I know you said your problem goes away after warming up, but I'll add my 
personal experience just as an FYI. My jerky FI troubles stemmed from a bad 
ground connection on the double relay. Check the screws that hold the double 
relay (upper left section of the compartment wall behind the engine) to the 
wall. If there's a gound wire on one of the screws, make sure the screw is 
tight. Mine was loose. I tightened it up and the problem disappeared.
