Tom,

Are you sure that the nut is stripped and not the stud?

Probably be easier to go down to the local "ace" hardware store and see if 
they have a stud of the right dimensions...or your local vwflaps.

Yes, you can cut and grind all day long on the nut, but if you hurt the 
threads on the stud, you are back in the same place....and if the stud is 
really stripped rather than the nit...same place again.

Cheers, dave
