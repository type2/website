Subject: About the Engine from 80 Westy 2L Air Cooled - 23 mpg

Hi David,

Sorry about the reference to ebay. After not having
any action from a free internet ad, I decided to clean
out my garage and put my 2L air cooled vanagon engine
on ebay. As an afterthought I also put an ad on type2
for $390. I got a good response from the type2 ad and
one potential buyer wants me to cancel the auction but
hasn't wired me the $390 or shown up with the cash.

You're right, I think it's too expensive to ship these
engines (probably would cost as much as the engine).
For anyone on the East coast or anyone else who can
get me the $390 before the auction closes (2 1/2
days), the engine is yours. For anyone buying from a
distance, I'll even hold the engine for a while so you
can arrange to have a buddy bring it West. I think
this 80 Westy air cooled is a good value at $390.

Rob
