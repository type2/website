Subject: It as begun, my trip web site...

Well, i have begun my 2003 trip web page to Baja and across the USA, i 
have more than 275 pictures that i will put online in the next few days, 
weeks...
You are invited to follow our adventure, and that at my cost!
No crap publicity, big picture and a fast server. the more we will go 
towards Baja,  bigger will be the images! Later, expect some 1024 x 768 
image.

I will do one page per day at night, each page will have about 10 to 25 
images, all are thumbnail (you can click to get a bigger size) pictures, 
 all big size image are compress to only 20%, expect delay!!! if you 
have 56K modem!

Please enjoy my trip,  a trip that i will remember the rest of my life.
Cheers, Ben
