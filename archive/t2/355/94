Subject: 74 bus basically no idle - solved

Thanks for everyone's suggestions on this. With Steve Dolan's help the
problem was solved last night. After all, new points did the trick.

However, the old ones looked fine and Steve's Dwell Meter was required
to find the problem. With the old points dwell jumped all over the
place. We are not sure what the cause was but Steve suspects that there
was something funny going on with the points (maybe tired spring?) that
caused them to bounce.

Now the long overdue carb adjustment and balance is on the top of my
list. Is there anyone on the list around the Washington, DC, area who
can tune these? Each time I try to mess with dual carbs they end up
running worse afterwards. These are 36-40 PDSIT (no separate idle
circuit) not the the stock 34 PDSIT. Alternatively, any recommendation
for shops around here to do this? The only one I can think of is Peak
Performance.
