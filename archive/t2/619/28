Subject: New Bus From The Bug Out

Hey folks,
     For those of you who were at the Bug Out week before last and saw the '75
Westy for sale for $1,500.00, well it's been sitting in my driveway since last
Friday. I gave it a hard look at the Bug Out, but wasn't ready to make an
offer, so I took the seller's phone number and called him Sunday evening. I
made an offer a good bit less than his asking price, and Monday went to his
house and looked it over again and left him a deposit. He'd have probably had
more interest in it if he had just washed the poor thing. From the outside it
looked pretty rough, but the interior is in decent shape. It also has a dual
carbed '74 engine in it. Anyway, it is loaded with goodies. It still has the
trash bin/stool, ice cube trays were still in the fridge, child's cot and
poles were under the bed, as was the front table with the leg. After a good
bath and hitting the paint with a buffer and polishing compound, it is looking
real good. I rewired the aux. battery Sunday, and the charger still works, as
does the fridge. I got it registered and tagged today, and with any luck it
should be making it debut at John Brown's Buses in Harper's Ferry W. Va. in
October. Here are a couple of links to some pics, sitting in the seller's
driveway and at my place:
