Of course, this kind of thing just makes me sick. Part of what drove me into 
AC VW's was economics. As a victim of the California injustice system, I 
originally paid $1800/mo of my $2000/mo salary in child support. Now at 8 
years later I'm down to $1000/mo support out of salary up to $2400. So 
living on the border of poverty, I feel a lot of resentment against an 
unfair system that did this to me. But I have found joy in cars that don't 
cost an arm and a leg to buy and maintain, and in people in the VW scene who 
have been accepting. Here in Red Bluff, I have found acceptance from a broad 
section of society because of the "cool" factor. But it often bothers me to 
be struggling so when I see people around me with nice cars, and nice homes 
(all we could qualify for was a 600 square foot home which is a converted 
garage). I know some on this list may be well off, and I don't mean to 
offend anyone. I do try to accept all equally and let their hearts speak 
rather than their pocket books. But I do take consolation in feeling that my 
vintange VW's are quality equipment made to last from an era when poor Volks 
were expected to maintain their own cars, and that most modern cars, even 
mercedes according to one mechanic I talked too, are disposable and not 
meant to be kept up.
