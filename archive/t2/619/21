Dave's right. Volks like us are just collateral damage. 

But there's another, more insidious, side to the story. How many of
the people creating these laws have a vehicle they drive daily that's
more than 5 years old? Gov. Brown's been out of office for a long time
now...

Have you ever been house or apartment hunting and found that you
wouldn't be allowed to own a car more than 10 years old unless it's a
100% restored classic (in their eyes, of course)? I have. I've run
into both apartment management and housing associations with that
rule.

To many "moneyed" people, our busses and most other older vehicles are
eyesores. They don't wan't to insult their fine sensibilities by
having to see us. So they convince themselves that they need to
restrict the use of these vehicles. Since they're not using the latest
technology, they MUST pollute more. Nevermind that a new vehicle would
have to be driven 15 years to compensate for the pollution created
when manufacturing the vehicle.

While I'm certain that few policymakers are consciously planning for
the destruction of older vehicles, it *is* an attitude that influences
their decisions.

I have people at work that turn up their noses whenever I pull up in
my bus. Not because it's burning oil either (it isn't... exhaust
smells clean!) But they're standing next to their brand new BMW's,
Mercedes, and even Honda Hybrids. (Not many Toyotas, except for the
occasional Lexus.) I, of course, laugh. And make sure to rev my engine
lots when pulling into the parking structure. Sets off the stupid car
alarms. =D
