Hello Guys  If you do it this way in the state of Virginia you have opened a 
real can of worms .  The rail buggy would have to have all the things a 2004 
car does(Airbags, defrost ETC)    Most people here use the old bug pan with the 
old bug numbers. heck if it is before 1969 it doesnt even have to have a 
windshield but it is supose to have wipers Go figure  but it is called the 
communistwealth of Virginia. Later and have fun  Mark Dearing
