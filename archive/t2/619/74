Jerry,

Tight exhaust valve...leading to hotter burning cylinder.

Timing/dwell out of spec very slightly...otherwise all plugs would have 
showed a little hotter burning.

Blocked cooling (check fan for leaves or rag)....just enought to make the 
one "problem" cylinder run a little hotter than usual.
Slight intake leak for that cylinder intake.

Do you adjust valves before the compression test or after?

Probably not a really big deal unless it continues...if just one cylinder, 
then probably just a tight valve adjustment.

Cheers, dave

As I don't have a garage, 

snip
 I do regular tune-ups, with careful valve adjustments, 
and at each tune-up I generally check the compression.  
I've been getting about 110 (+/- 2).  
But this last time, the compression in #3 was 85.  
Also, the spark plug in that cylinder was grayish-white, 
whereas the others were brownish-black.  
The engine, with only 7K miles, is still under 
warranty, and the shop will stand behind it, 
but I'm really wondering what is going on in that cylinder.  
Before I make the trip to Oregon, not trivial but often a pleasure, 
I'd like to have a better understanding of what might 
have gone wrong and what I might do to protect myself from a repeat.  Any thoughts?
