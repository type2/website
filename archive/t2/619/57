Dumb question but, is the smog law there because there are so many old cars on the road b/c they don't rust out, and with the proper care, you could be driving a 30-40 year old car that wasn't a death trap due to rust? 

Is it due to the number or the cars or the age of the cars or a combo? 

Just curious...
