trains don't have steering wheels, and they can take up to two miles to
stop, trains don't hit cars and trucks, cars get in front of the train.

NEVER RACE A TRAIN, in case of a TIE!  YOU LOSE!  A small diesel engine
can easily weigh more than 100 of our buses.  (200+ tons!)   and a single
railroad car can weigh 125tons!!

be carefull, don't risk your life or that of your bus.
