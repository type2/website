Subject: US elections

Sorry to ask but I'm really curious:
------------

Why do you US guys NEVER go off-topic and 
talk a bit about the US elections?

Many of us European guys are worried and 
have very little contact with the US people
other than these and other world-wide lists.

It wouldn't be completely off-topic due to 
the current oil crisis and the high fuel 
consumption of both the GS and the VW type 2.
