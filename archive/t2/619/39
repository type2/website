Hi Richard,

Another point... Note that the law requires "Collector's Insurance", 
which usually severely limits the use of the vehicle. No more than a 
few thousand miles per year, box stock, driven only to car shows, etc. 
etc, etc.

Nice of the legislators to pass the regulation of "Collector Car" over 
to the in$urance Indu$try, rather than to define it themselves.


Happy trails,
