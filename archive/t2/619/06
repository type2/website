Has anyone seen the new oil coolers and starters from a company called Bruck?

The parts are advertized as OE German quality and you can see some Germany text right on the box. The local VW resto shop told me that there is a company in Brazil called Germany and that is where these parts actually come from. Anybody know the scoop?
