Hi Mark,

Here in Ontario (Canada) an aircooled Bus is a rarity on the roads. I 
might have seen 6 or 8 buses that I don't know all summer. I  routinely 
get waves, peace signs and thumbs up when driving around in the 
westfakia. The last campout we went to was only 75 miles from home and 
I think we got 5 or six waves.

I don't remember the last time I got a 1-fingered wave.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
