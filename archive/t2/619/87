Subject: Re: [T2] PARTS IN ONTARIO CANADA

Hi Darren,

Used parts places?? In Ontario??  ROFL.

There are swap meets associated with local VW events, but other than 
that it comes down to who you know and what they have at the moment. 
The local wrecking yards near Toronto have NOTHING Aircooled....

We had a pretty good swap meet going at Buses Of The Corn last month, 
but I think the swap season is just about over now.

www.germansupply.com can help with new parts.

Happy trails,
