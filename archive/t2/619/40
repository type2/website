Subject: California smog revision, vary un-cuth questions

I know asking this makes me an A#$ H%#(-at-). But...
If the idiots get their way, what happens to all the cars that got the
"shaft"????

will this mean an influx of VW's to "non smog" areas????

And on a related note what does this mean for the rest of the VW world as a
whole???

Will all the Cal. Based shops/suppliers be run out of business???

Will all the junk yards/used parts vendors start crushing VWs due to the
"loss" or perceived loss of the California market???

Am I just being paranoid??
