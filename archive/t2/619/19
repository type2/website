Subject: Re: [T2] VIN swap (was Jay Leno)

Folks,

Everything I have seen on this subject has to do with the "gorillas"...
you know, those cars that drive down the hiway spewing blue/black clouds 
of smoke cause the people that own them just can't afford to get them 
fixed or buy new ones...it has nothing to do with "vintage" cars as these 
are generally ummmm... "well kept"....

Anyone have *any* idea at all how many baywindows are still out there 
running around???

Cheers, dave(who lives in a state where not only are there no emissions 
             tests, but not even any inspections)
