Subject: smog test    AB 2683

Help All Californians  Breathe Easier. Urge Governor Schwarzenegger to sign 
AB 2683 today! 
What does AB 2683  do? 
AB 2683 will improve air quality  and reduce emissions by eliminating the 
"30-year rolling exemption" that  currently exists in the Smog Check program. 
This bill will not bring any  vehicles that are currently exempt into the 
program.
