That's usually illegal as well, but it's fairly
technical depending on what all you swap (ie pan
and such).  

If you are building a rail framed vehicle, you
usually are required to apply for a newly
manufactured vehicle title, which will not have a
VIN.  

How much sense does it make?  It makes a lot of
sense to ensure that vehicles aren't stolen or
vehicle fraud isn't committed. 

It's the environmental laws that don't make
sense.
