Heh.  I'd loove to move in there with a 2003 VW Bug.  I'd even
swap the fenders for dented ones, different colour each, and
the bumpers for rusted ones.  Then in 2013, swap back to the
original stuff and hey presto, 100% restored classic.  :-)

I am certain that such destruction is consciously planned.  Helps
the car industry.  And never mind that workshops and restorers,
parts dealers and junkyards are employers and taxpayers too --
they don't have a lobby.

Yup.  The day of the revenge comes when they come to you and need
something hauled.  Kindly refer 'em to U-Haul or Budget or some
such -- "they got new vans, that's better for the environment 
isn't it?"

Airhowlingly yours,
