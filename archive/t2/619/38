Subject: Slightly OT: Picture Hosting

This is a pretty frequent scenario:

List member discussing his/her bus. Posts a website with pics on
Geocities or another similar service.

By the time I've gotten the email and visited the site, the hourly
bandwidth has been exceeded and I have to check back every few minutes
to see it.

Needless to say, I rarely check back. Even though I really enjoy
seeing other people's busses, it's just a hassle.

Now, instead of just ranting, I have a solution. Actually three!

1) Send me your pics, no larger than 500 pixels on the longest side
(or larger, and I'll resize them). I'll put them on my donimages site
(or the adsfunclub one, to help spread the bandwidth around).

2)visit: http://pics.bbzzdd.com and sign up. It's free, and you can
host pics for emails there.

3)visit: http://www.thesamba.com and sign up. It's free, and you can
create an entire gallery.

Please don't use either source for ebay or other hosting. the bbzzdd
site and The Samba will just give an error when you try, and I'll
delete them quick off of mine.

Go ahead and use geocities for sharing with friends and family, but
keep in mind that you have a VERY limited amount of bandwidth
available there. My servers have quite a bit of unused bandwidth and I
don't mind sharing. The Samba is what it is, and they accept
donations. bbzzdd was created to give members of the Anandtech forums
a place to put pics for threads on the forums.

Thanks for reading, and I hope this helps some folks out!
