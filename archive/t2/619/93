Subject: new solex 35 carbs

there is a new solex 35mm dual carburetor kit with electric chokes 
available from SCAT.  Has anyone tried these?  I was thinking about 
buying the kit and replacing my old, worn out  single progressive weber 
on my 74 Westy (2.0L).   Any info would be greatly appreciated.  
Thanks.
