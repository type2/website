Sure - these books are not for small kids though...I'm guessing they'd be 
good for ages 8-12 though that's just a guess.  But smaller kids - such as 
my two year old - love the pictures.

"How Things Work - Cars Bikes Trains and Other Land Machines" (I don't know 
how to underline when I'm online), by Ian Graham, published by Kingfisher.  
1993  $4.50 used is what I paid.

"Car" - a Dorling Kindersley ("Eyewitness Books") book (#21 of all the 
possible topics, I think), by Richard Sutton.  1990 was the first edition 
and the edition I have is 2000. $15.99

The books are equally valuable and really quite interesting/informative.  
The first one shows cars, trucks and all other "land machines" and how they 
are designed, e.g. skateboards even.  The second one shows the history and 
designs (and accessories and fashions even) of cars from the first car to 
current cars, how and why they came up with designs, etc.  It shows great 
photographs of early cars and parts (as well as modern), and all the parts 
are laid out where they would be if they were put together - if that makes 
sense, starting with the machinery, then the interior, then the exterior.  
I'm really into antiques so I love the photos of authentic parts and bizarre 
accessories that would probably be worth a lot of money should someone 
stumble across them now.  Fun stuff!
