Subject: Loss of compression in newer 1600 Mexi

Hi Folks,

Can I interrupt the discussion of California smog rules to get in a question about engines?

This time last year I bought a new 1600 Mexi DP for my '70 bus.  As I don't have a garage, I had a trust shop in Oregon put in the engine.  They did a fine job of it.  I do regular tune-ups, with careful valve adjustments, and at each tune-up I generally check the compression.  I've been getting about 110 (+/- 2).  But this last time, the compression in #3 was 85.  Also, the spark plug in that cylinder was grayish-white, whereas the others were brownish-black.  The engine, with only 7K miles, is still under warranty, and the shop will stand behind it, but I'm really wondering what is going on in that cylinder.  Before I make the trip to Oregon, not trivial but often a pleasure, I'd like to have a better understanding of what might have gone wrong and what I might do to protect myself from a repeat.  Any thoughts?

Thanks,
Jerry Azevedo
