Subject: JD Power rates BugHaus #1 in customer satisfaction

If you haven't ordered any parts from BugHaus before you are missing out on their excellent quality parts and customer service. For my last order they simply went way beyond expectation to get the highest quality parts for me.

Visit their excellent website at http://www.bughaus.com
