this is all based on my BA-4 so somethings might be different

mine is installed under the front pan where the A/C evaporator was
formally installed.  I recirculate the air using the old A/C blower
mounted in the stock glove box location. take air in there blow thru new
ducts in the floor thru the heater and then back into the stock duct above
the front beam.  fuel is run in a tube along a frame rail,  exhaust is run
forward and exhausted facing rearward at the edge of the front bumper into
the slip stream

I have no stock heater at all.   and unless I get my heater reinstalled
before it gets cold I won't have any heat at all.  had to remove it to get
to the front beam for some repair work.
