Having lived in Orange County in the middle 1960s, when on summer days 
you couldn't see across your backyard, I can assure you that 
environmental laws make a lot of sense.

What's going to happen, if what you say is true, is that there is going 
to be a net increase of '74 and '75 buses in CA, and a substantial 
decrease in '76s through '79s.
