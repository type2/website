I don't deny this. But I also know that without environmental regs and 
laws, there wouldn't be anywhere worth driving to.

What will probably happen if this goes through -- and I hope it doesn't 
go through -- is that a lot of Californians will buy 75 and earlier 
buses, and we'll sell our 76-79s to people out of state. And yes, this 
shows how absurd the law can be. But it really wasn't crafted with our 
buses in mind.
