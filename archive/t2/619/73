Subject: Re: [T2] California BUS

The original emissions stuff on my old bus, 1971, were PCV and a fuel 
tank evaporative emissions activated charcoal filter thing. No EGR.

As a sidebar issue -- does anyone know how much emissions a stock 1971 
bus w/ the above, would have had?

NOx, CO, and HC, when compared against, say, a new Honda sedan,  a Ford 
Expedition intimidation vehicle, an H2 penis enlargement device, all 
Cali style.
