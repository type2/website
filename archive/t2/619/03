Marya,

LOL!!!  You might stop to wonder how all of us who *do* know how to work 
on an engine learned it....

You are now where I was when I bought my first vw in 1966.  I started with 
the owners manual, which actually tells you how to do things like adjust 
the generator belt and othe "maintenance" items.

Then you get Muir and then Bentley when you are ready to tackle the heavy
stuff.  Pick something to do and the read up on it, look at the pics in 
the books, compare to what you have and dive in!!

Expeierience, experience, experience...that's why it seems that we know 
more than you!  I have ummm...38 years of working on VW's off and 
on....and you?....and there are things that I have *never* done on various 
vw's.... still laughing...I have other talents as well...<grin>

Cheers, dave
