And THAT is the reason I started this list: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/type2talklist

Talk waht you like there with the same listers as here (in theory) but let's keep the bus stuff here so the tech stuff  gets into the archives and the 'stuff" stay over at the other group. 

Join and discuss what you like non-bus.
