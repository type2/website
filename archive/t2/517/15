Subject: Re: [T2] dent in sliding door track

Hi Keith,

My 73 rustfailia forced me to get creative with the slider track. What 
I wound up doing was creating a new floor for the slider track using 
autobody sheet metal I bought at a FLAPS. This worked well enough for 3 
years, until the cancer elsewhere in the bus eventually caught up with 
it. The repair was basically a new slin for the lower rocker that 
folded in along the floor of the slider track and ended at the back 
wall.

If the damage is minor then JB-Weld can also help fill pits in a slider 
track. Make sure the track is EXTREMELY clean before you put the epoxy 
on there. Also be aware that even the "Kwik" version of JB weld will 
take a LOOOOONG time to cure in cold weather, so if it's winter where 
you are now you will need to find  indoor parking for JB-Weld to work 
properly. Smooth it with sandpaper when you're done and the result will 
be a big improvement.

Happy trails,
