The new release of Cheaper by The Dozen with Steve Martin.

Has one of the Buskatier's buses in it.

Have to look for the differences in the buses to spot which one is "Holly".
I believe her bumper is light gray rather than white.

name's not Gerland and I live 100 miles from Houston} <grin>) here:
