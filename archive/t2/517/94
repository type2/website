Re: [T2] Burned Valves: Why?


I also had a exhaust valve (no 3) pounded in the head
on my 79 stock engine which I figure was the injector
for that cylinder. I had the injectors tested and
cleaned and sure enough the injector for the #3
cylinder was pumping out 15% less volume then the
other three. I cant say that this alone caused the
valve problem ...but, everything else looked good.
You might want to take your injectors out and mark
them with the cylinder number and have them flow
tested.

Good luck
 BTW..no more problems since then, with about 15 to 20
thousand miles since getting the heads redone by
Ronnie of Havasu.
