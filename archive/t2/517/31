1971 VW Bus in decent condition I really need to sell
it or trade it for your pickup 2 or 4wd extended cab
(with just the little tiny seat behind the front
seat). My bus runs very reliably and I would expect
the same from any trade vehicle. My bus has a westy
Z-bed in it. I have a propane tank, mini fridge with
inverter and sink which are not currently installed.
It runs great and is currently my daily driver. It has
the permanent high-roof so I (6'1") can stand
comfortably on the inside of the bus. It needs some
cosmetic work but is really great mechanically. Give
me an e-mail for more information or to make me an
offer or whatever. I really love this bus but I need
to sell it soon! Thanks for looking!!!!!!! -Matt
