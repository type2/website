Negatory. You need one of those little adaptors to go from the smaller 
manifold to the larger carb base.

I used to have one to go from my dual port manifold to my 30-pict-3 carb. 
(Used it upside down.) It was a cheap form of cruise control. On the flat 
highway I had a brick that I would just push over on top of the accelerator 
and it would hold the speed steady at 58 mph.
