Subject: HORN, was: Question about horn and windshield washer system

Guys, on that note, any idea why my horn beep-beeps when I pull my steering column down towards me or turn it hard?  It only does it when the spring is on.  I rubber coated the spring and it still does it.  WHAT is grounding out??  Under the turn signal ring is the spring then a metal wedge on top of the bearing.  Am I missing something?  I just can't figure this out!
Ratwell? Jason? JPH?
