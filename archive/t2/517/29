In my case, my 67 Standard EZ camper came this way when I found it at my local Pick n Pull.
It had the 1600 with dual kadrons installed sitting in the cargo area. I bought it, dragged it home, replaced
all the missing tin, the bent pushrod tube, put in a 15 gallon fuel tank, and installed the engine. It is a
runner.
