Subject: [F] bus movie sighting

ifc or sundance (sorry, i forget) showed a foreign movie this week 
called 'french twist' - a somewhat interesting sex farce. i mean, no 
WAY would hollywood make a movie where a female lead falls in love 
with a diesel dyke.
anyways, the DD in question drives a beat-up panel bay, painted with 
a mural of krishna. good shots of a decrepit interior  :)
i -almost- turned off the movie in the first five minutes, since the 
DD meets the other woman when she stops to ask... for water for the 
motor!!    she also complains what a crappy motor it has; well, yeah, 
you keep puttin' water in there, sumpin's bound to break........
