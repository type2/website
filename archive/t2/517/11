Subject: Crazy flashing turn signal

The left turn signal on my 71 Westy has been flashing
crazy fast lately. At first I though it was a bad bulb
or flasher relay, so I relaced these with new parts. I
have double checked the ground on the light socket. 
Both the front and rear bulbs DO flash when the signal
is on, just VERY VERY fast.  The right side signal
flashes normal, as do the hzard lights.
So, any ideas???
