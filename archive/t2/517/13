Subject: dent in sliding door track

My 69 bus's sliding door track is starting to sag in the last 6 inches 
before it closes. It is not too bad yet (the door still closes with some 
effort) but I am wondering if anyone had any sugestions for extra support.  
There is some rust there but not enough to warant buying a new door tract 
for $120.  My first thought was to manufacture a "L" bracket. Has anyone 
done this before?
