Subject: re:bus TV sighting

I was surfing the channels the other night and came a cross an Ashley
Judd/Tommy Lee Jones movie. For some reason Ashley was handcuffed,
(mmmm...Ashley Judd in handcuffs....oops was that outloud?)to the outside
passenger door handle of a car, on a ferry. She got the car running and
started backing the car repeatedly into a baywindow that was parked behind.
