The actual number is not listed on my 1983 German
Fiche. It is also not listed on the USA fiche from
1976.

I think the first three numbers identify the type of
engine. Judging from the partnr of a complete engine I
would say '029' is a dual-carb 2000cc engine (enginenr
starting with CJ). It was used from modelyear 1976
until 1979, but not on US and Canadian buses since
they had Fuel Injection.

The head of the CJ engine has partnr:

   029.101.351 B

comes close to the 029.101.371B you were talking
about, but it's not quite it so might be a completely
different part after all.

By the way: it says this head was used from enginenr
CJ 081 817 and up.
