Subject: Reminder: "True Canadian Winter Bus Campout" - Cambridge ON,

Hi Volks,

Can someone please forward this to the Vanagon list(s)?

Since it's Friday of the weekend before, I thought this would be a good 
time to send out a reminder about the True Canadian Winter Bus Campout 
taking place Saturday Feb 28th to Sunday Feb 29th. You don't have to be 
Canadian to attend, but you will have to be able to camp in winter.

The event will be held at Valens Conservation Area in Cambridge 
Ontario. This park has serviced campsites about 35 minutes east of 
Toronto and less than two hours from the US Border.

Valens doesn't take reservations in winter, but I have been assured 
that we won't really need any, there would be LOTS of serviced sites 
available for us on the weekend of February 28th. The parks has heated 
washrooms, showers and laundry machines.  They also have ice fishing 
and cross country skiing available in the park. If you're planning to 
fish, please get a license beforehand.

The event info site is at:
http://www.pottsfamily.ca/The_Bug_Pack/TCWBC/

You need to bring $7 in change to operate the gate in case it is 
unattended. Pay your way in, then find a campsite and set up. The park 
staff will eventually come around and register you, deducting the $7 
from your fees. Campsites cost only $25.50 CDN, and food should run 
about $10 or so. The event info site has the menu posted if you're 
interested.

If you're planning on coming please let me know, there's also a group 
menu you can opt in on if you don't wanna do any cooking.


Happy trails,
