The most common (and appropriate) dual Webers for a type IV engine are
either the 40IDF or 36IDF.  But there are 2 or 3 other models that could be
used.  The model number will be stamped on each carb on the side kinda
between the 2 barrels.  Find the markings and you find your answer.

I ran dual 40IDF's on my 73 Westy (1.8 motor) for many years and loved them.
Good power, relatively easy stripping and cleaning procedures and very
reliable.  There's a science to getting them set up right and an art to
getting them balanced, but nothing that you can't learn yourself.  Find out
exactly what you've got (model, venturi size, air/main/idle jets, etc) and
go from there.
