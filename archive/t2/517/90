Subject: Re: [T2] Burned Valves: Why?

Has anyone yet mentioned the valve guides?? It is near the top of the list 
if you have a burned valve. The factory offers no procedure for their 
replacement. They were not able to develop a reasonable procedure to 
replace them that they felt reliable. You must find someone who will put 
forth a procedure not found typically in a machine job shop. If he follows 
Porsche procedures it could be done. Another option is internal knurling. 
Using the proper size thread forming tap you can swage threads into both 
ends. This swells the metal and reduces the internal diameter. Then they 
can be reamed to spec.

If the guides are worn to excess the valve can't lose it's heat. A 
perfectly functioning cooling system can't stop it from burning if the heat 
of combustion is not carried across the gap from the stem to the guide. 
That's why the seats overheat. No help getting rid of the heat through the 
stem makes excess heat at the seat.

Pick any of hundreds of specs on that motor. Ignore one. Flip a coin. Get 
lucky or get redo-redo-redo. In the case of worn valve guides nobody gets 
lucky when spec is ignored.

No one who does volume rebuilt VW heads uses good procedures. They all work 
to a highly compromised price. They sure as hell don't have 
time/equipment/skill to do the work right if the market demands compromise.
