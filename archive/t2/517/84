I agree it must be heat but I disagree with some of Phils suggestions
here.
Dissassembly, cleaning and getting all of the tin and cooling system/flaps
etc in order. Good.

Keeping oil temp under 210 unrealistic. First the gauges read widely
different. Secondly if the engine is overheating the oil with a stock
cooler the heads and cylinders are overheating too and no external cooler
is going to solve that.

Gauges are good IMO Oil temp, Pressure and perhaps Head temp.

An external oil cooler will keep the oil temps low while not solving the
cause of the overheating. all it will do is give you cooler oil. :)

This could be a lean running issue too because a lot of the valve cooling
is due to the fuel.
