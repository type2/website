Scott, et. al.

From the book quoted below, *not* verified.

			1.7liter	1.8/2.0liter
inlet opens             4  BTDC		2  BTDC
inlet closes		39 ABDC		35 ABDC
Exhaust opens		40 BBDC		35 BBDC
Exhaust closes		3  ATDC		6  ATDC

Sorry guys, There are no "lift" numbers in the book which makes 
the specs above pretty much useless as we don't know if they are
at the newer "measured at .050 valve lift" or the older lift spec numbers.

What **is** interesting is that the book makes *no* comment about
solid v.s. hydraulic specs!...the Europeans did get hdraulic T4's, right 
Vincent?  Remember this book is published in england at/by 
www.russek-manuals.com(from the back of the book...I can't reach them).


Anyone with the Bill Fisher "How to Hotrod.." book can spend the rest of 
the day re-reading the section on cam timing and do some calculating.

The folks with Desktop Dyno can play with the numbers above after they
go measure total valve lift at the valve and let us know.  I have played
with the above numbers on desktop dyno and got pretty close to stock
numbers on hp and torque, but it was last year sometime.

The book does state that camshafts for automatic and manual trans
engines *are* different ...but it doesn't say how.

Folks with a known good camshaft can probably play with it a little
and get lift at the camshaft and go from there...

I *did* measure an engle 100 when I built a t1 daily driver and it(or me)
was off a few degrees in places....but that was after absolutely indexing
#1 for tdc and with depth gauges carefully watched as I rotated the engine
for the actually degree numbers.


Sorry it wasn't all we wanted to know...maybe Richard or someone who
talks to webcam a lot can just call them up and ask them(nicely)...after
explaining that 1400 people would really like to know!

Cheers, dave
