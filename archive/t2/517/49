List,

Other of us have been saying all along that hydraulic cams have a different
ramp design. I am not enough of an expert to know why hydraulic cams are
shaped differently than solid lift ones, but they are. To me this means the
two are NOT interchangeable.

As Karl notes, the lift seems to be the same between stock cams, hydro or
solid. To illustrate what I am talking about, I made a little web page
showing some different cam lobes from type IV camshafts. You can clearly see
the difference between the ramp shape of each cam, most importantly the way
the hydraulic cam has a ramp which "bellies" out noticeably on the approach
to the apex.
