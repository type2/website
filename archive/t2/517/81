Subject: Re: [T2] Question about horn and windshield washer system

Usually when I get intermittent problems, I remove the horn button
(sharp knife under lip of button).  Unscrew the three bolts holding the
ring and clean the 2 contact edges with fine sandpaper until yoiu see
shiny, not oxidized metal.  Don't lose the springs! Check the spade
connector contact also.
