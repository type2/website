Subject: time to replace engine

Hi all:

My 2 liter 78 Campmobile may need a new engine. I'll find out next week.

A 1.8 liter engine has become available (Free!)  Can I use it to 
replace the 2.0, or is this a bad idea? Would it be unduly difficult? 
Would the camper be too too underpowered?

Thanks.

Rob Mead
