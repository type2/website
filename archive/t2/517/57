> Other of us have been saying all along that
 hydraulic cams have a different
 ramp design. I am not enough of an expert to know
 why hydraulic cams are
 shaped differently than solid lift ones, but they
 are. To me this means the
 two are NOT interchangeable.
 
------------------------------------------------------

That is called ramp speed. It will be most noticeable
on the back side of the lobe. Solids don't care but
hydraulics do. If the ramp speed is too fast, then the
lifter will follow the lobe faster than the valve
spring will keep pressure on the lifter. The pushrod
will actually float and the hydraulic lifter will pump
up. In other words, the lifter will fully extend the
piston inside of it. Then you end up with zero
compression because the valve is hanging open.....
I have not seen any difference in ramp speed between
sock VW cams.
