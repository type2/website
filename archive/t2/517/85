I agree w/ the others that a serious look into the condition of the
cooling parts would be in order. However I might throw out another
idea. If it was the same cyl each time it might be the fi injector.
Take a look at the plugs. it's possible that the cyl is running lean
and causing a hotter than normal condition. w/ no compression in the
cyl it sure won't help tell you much now, but if you happened to have
looked at the others at times before failure, it might lead you to
some additional info.
