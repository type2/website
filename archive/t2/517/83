Greg,

Ummmmm...some "no's" in here...I'm gonna cut all the parts out except
what I consider the inaccuracies....see resposnes below.

Been reading the megasquirt list for about 2 years or so now...some of
those people are *far* beyond what I understand...and must be automotive 
engineers...and *good* ones!

Cheers, dave

No, Bentley green book, page 11 in the FI section on testing the fuel 
pressure regulator.  Bentley "says" that fuel pressure is most important 
at idle because of the exhaust emissions.  It also says that when you test
the regulator you get:

vacuum hose off = ~35psi  (33-37 considered of by experienced mechanics)
vacum hose on   = ~28psi  (26-30 "                                    ")

So fuel pressure is *not* constant.  So, with hi vacuum(not much 
throttle), they want 28 psi...at hi throttle(low vacuum) they want
35psi.

Connector to the coil from ecu tells *when* to inject.
AFM tells *duration* of injector opening(or how much fuel).

The AFM line above is why a lot of us want to go to megasquirt...
#1, it is "supposed" to be a restriction in the air intake and #2,
I've "heard" that at about 4,000 rpm, the vane is on the max limit....so
you really don't get a longer duration of squirt, but you do get more of
them because the ecu is also watching the rpm's as well.


So, the below line is also not correct.  Otherwise, we would not have a
vacuum operated fuel pressure regulator.
