Subject: RE: [T2] Anyone tried 27x8.5x14 on wide five rims?

What's a wide five rim?  I'm using B.F. Goodrich All Terrain TA tires on my 
'78 stock rims, which are 5.5" wide, I think.  They look 
fan-freakin'-tastic, but there is a looseness somewhere in my suspension 
that I have been unable to locate that makes even small bumps go "KLUNK!", 
so I can't comment on the handling.  My bus handles horrible.  I mean 
absolutly horrible.  There is no way people bought these cars new if this is 
stock handling.  The cheap tires on it when I bought it handled just about 
the same as these, but as I said, I know something major is wrong somewhere 
else.  I've got new KYB shocks, wheel bearings, and steering dampner, and 
everything feels tight when I grab and yank it, but the "KLUNK" is loud when 
the front wheels hit the potholes in my gravel driveway.  ARRRRGH!  OK, well 
I'm way off topic now, you probably meant 5 lugs anyway.  Happy bussing, and 
if you get B.F. Goodrich All Terrain TAs, let me know what I should be 
expecting out of my bus.  Thanks!
