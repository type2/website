Subject: Any listies in Tucson?

Hey folks...

I'm going to be in Tucson, AZ from March 4-7 (actually flying out on 
the 8th) for a family function.  I'll be busy on Saturday, but would 
love to meet some local Bus folks over beer / pizza / tamales / etc. on 
one of the other evenings.

P-mail me if interested!
