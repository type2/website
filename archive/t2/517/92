I said in my post that the pressure differential at the tip of the injector
is constant. For all purposes because that is fixed.

If you want to look at it like a math equation it's:

(rpm + afm) * (engine temp + air temp + lambda)

where lambda is optional.

Aren't there theoretical limits to engine power anyway? What kind of
improvement are you expecting?
