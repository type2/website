Subject: Burned Valves: Why?

Hi all,
  I am the proud owner of a '78 Westfalia with an appetite for exhaust 
valves.  It was the first bus I had ever driven, and when I test drove it, I 
said, "wow! they weren't kidding when they said these things are 
underpowered!"  The owner said it had been rebuilt just 15,000 miles ago.  I 
bought it anyway because it was rust free, and drove it several months 
before doing a tune-up.  At that point I found that the compression on one 
cylinder was a big fat goose egg.  Wow!  So I pulled the engine and took the 
heads off, and I found that the exhaust valve seat had been pounded into the 
head on the afore mentioned cylinder.  I also found that it was a GEX motor. 
  Ugh!  So I replaced the heads with some rebuilt ones from the local VW 
parts shop (one was stamped SIR, but they didnt really match each other) 
and off I went.  Oh the power!  Eventually I burned out an exhaust valve on 
each head though, so out they came, and on went another pair, from the same 
place.  Ill take the blame for that one though, as I attempted to build my 
own muffler out of stainless steel tube and used lathe shavings for my 
packing.  Anyway, new heads and an ANSA muffler, and a month later I broke 
an exhaust valve spring.  So I replaced that, and now, less than 200 miles 
later, Ive got 0 compression on one cylinder.  What gives?  Am I buying bad 
heads?  Ive gone through 5 heads in about 1500 miles.  Its still got the 
stock fuel injection, and runs like a top when it runs.

Thanks for any information!
