Not on TV, but yesterday I was at the local CSAA office and there on the
wall was a big poster of a '71 Bus painted up as an American flag with the
owner grinning from the driver's seat. The poster was one of a series,
this particular one advertising their automotive insurance business. I
wonder if one could get a copy of that poster.
