Subject: Re: [T2] Miniature Woodstove

The bus I remember from about '96 was set up for ice fishing, the owner
had a small woodstove with what looked like a double wall chimney and he
had cut an access hole in the floor of the bus that he covered with
wood.
I remember thinking it didn't look like a daily driver, just a mobile
ice fishing rig.
