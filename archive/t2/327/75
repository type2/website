Mr. Schwarze,

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe you are attempting to point out 
that Mobil-1 synthetic oil both:
	a) breaks down at a higher temp
	b) lubricates well even at these higher temps (what weight are you 
		running, anyway?)

It would be worth noting that you are running a type-4 engine (although I 
figure that just about everyone on the list is aware of this), and as 
such, you have a full flow filter.  In addition, type-4's tend to run 
hotter than type-1's...

I, too, have gotten over my fear of somewhat high oil temps, albeit for a
type-1 engine.  This summer, I managed to cope with running at 230-235 
despite the gut feeling that my engine was going to go "thud".  

My only issue with running synthetic would be that I tend to follow two 
guidelines for oil changes:
	a) changes should happen somewhere around the 1500-2000 mile mark
	b) changes should take place sooner if the oil is 
		dark/discolored/dirty (ala Herr Doktor, Tim)

As such, I expect that it would get mighty expensive, were I to run 
synthetic without moving to a full flow filter.  

The flipside of this is that I now have a job and will probably be a 
little more anxious to "get where I'm going", and as such, moving to 
synthetic, even at the higher cost, might be worth it to me, should it 
afford some sort of additional protection against "failure".  And perhaps 
offset the cost of building out one of the 3 cores that I seem to have 
acquired over the last 2 months, should my trusty (ha!) 1600dp fail.

If I have missed any points on your vouching for synthetic, please fill us 
in.
