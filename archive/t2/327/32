Subject: Wanted: 71-74 Westy in So. Cal

Greetings Listees -

A friend of mine can't stand it any longer - he needs to get another Westy 
after 8 years non-busing.

We're looking for a '71-74 Westy in decent shape. He's not a mechanic, but 
can do interior refurb, so a good running gear is preferable. He wants to 
limit the price to $5K.

We're in sunny/rainy/sunny/rainy So. Cal. (LA Area), and can drive a 100 
mile radius, if necessary.

Keep an eye out for us?
