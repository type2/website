Subject: Re: [T2] Max temp

I'm told Oil starts to lubricate best at around 200 degrees. I would be
cautious about running at over 280 degrees.... the thing is, a great deal
depends on the ambient outdoor temp....if it's hot, expect to run hotter oil
temps... for the winter, you want around 200 degrees for best engine
lubrication. See the discussion on the "Hoover Sermons" webpage.
