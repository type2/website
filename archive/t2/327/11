Subject: Re: master cylinder replacement report

Thanks, Billy.

    No weep hole!?!?!

I guess I will order the rebuilt Master Brake Cylinder ! ! And I can pick it 
up at the FLAPS tomorrow, with no shipping charges.  $40.19.  (The MB 
cylinder repair kit is $42.99, but the rebuilt one is only $40.19.  now, 
which one should I buy?!?!??)

I was up real early this AM, trying to build my shopping list for BD, but I 
guess the other things can wait.


I don't expect an 'O' ring with the rebuilt  MB Cylinder, but I guess I can 
cut some rubber from a bicycle inner tube and seal the outer flange of the 
MB Cylinder, or get a tube of gasket material from the FLAPS.

I did get the rebuilt brake calipers for my '72, with pins and spring 
(butterfly) retainers and pads for just $50 each from this national FLAPS.

Pretty nice, but I did have to reset (turn about 15 degrees) the pistons and 
use the old. cleaned up shims, with the press-outs to keep the pistons from 
rotating.

BTW, I reused the metal brake lines from the '82 calipers I got from a 
donor, because the '72 lines were 'stressed' by yours truly in getting them 
off.  No big deal, but the Vanagon brake lines required a 12 mm wrench, 
where the '72 required a 11 mm wrench.

I can just see it,  some 15-20 years from now when the next owner of the '72 
is arguing on the type 2 list about the wrench size for the metal brake 
lines on their '72 being 12 mm, not 11 mm!!

Crazy world, filled with crazy people.
