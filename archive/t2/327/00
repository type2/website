Subject: Checking advance

I've got the stock distributor with centrifugal and vacuum advance only.
There is a spark advance table in Bentley on page 75 of Engine and Clutch
but little advice how to perform the tests.

I can imagine plugging the vacuum can and hose in order to test the
centrifugal advance but how do you test the vacuum advance? If I hooked up a
hand pump (honestly it's not mine!) with my vacuum gauge inline would the
advance values in the table include the built-in centrifugal advance I can't
easily isolate?
