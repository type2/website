Subject: Spray in p/u truck bedliner for floors

Got some questions for you:

Any reason not to use these spray in bedliners? I have a friend that does 
this for a living and I am thinking about doing the cargo area floor - up 
about the first 4" all around. I am concerned about rust starting under the 
liner "paint". Valid?

I'm curious: (not going to try this) would this be suitable for an 
undercoating? Seems like a good material for the rear of the front 
fenderwells where rust begins.

Like Terry said one time: car manufacturers don't use these materials and 
the repair industry doesn't use them - should we?

Is it really a question of everyone but us trying to get the job done at 
minimal cost?

This stuff ain't cheap though. Luckily he is cutting me a BIG break. About 
$50 for the job.
