No doubt you'll hear many versions of this.  What I and many others have
done is to install the VDO oil temperature and cylinder head temperature
gauges, along with the VDO oil pressure gauge.  With those three gauges,
you'll get the full picture of how your engine is running.  There is a nice
looking plastic 3 hole gauge mounting pod available that makes all go
together very nicely.  I got mine from Bus Boys.

The dipstick sender from Gene Berg is easier to install, but it is not
really a gauge.  Rather, it is a temperature switch that you hook up to the
existing oil pressure light or a new light that you install.  I tried this,
and what I found is that it kept turning the light on under even moderate
driving conditions (71 westy with stock 1600 DP).  I checked and found it's
calibration to be accurate as best I could tell, but having the thing going
off all the time was annoying and caused me to ignore it.

My VDO oil temperature gauge shows lower temperatures (highest I ever saw
was 210 deg. F), but I also found it to be accurately calibrated.

The difference has to be due to where the oil temperature is being measured,
which would be above the oil sceen for the Berg sender, below, in the sump
plate, for the VDO sender.  I think there is also a dipstick sender, but I
have not tried that.

In the end, what matters most as far as I'm concerned is to establish what
is normal for your engine, and then have a way of conveniently and
continuously monitoring it so you are immediately aware of any changes.

Hello

I have recently installed a new VEGE engine to my camper.  I would like to
fit some sort of Temp gauge just in case of problems.  I have seen a number
of products on the market such as, a dipstick that reads the Oil temp and an
Oil temp gauge that has a sender unit to a dial you can mount on the dash or
a cylinder head temp gauge that can also be mounted on the dash.

Does anyone out there have any advice on what maybe the best product for my
needs?

Thanks
