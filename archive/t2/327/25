Right under the middle of it - under the round plate in the middle of the 
engine. I like to add a towel or a thin piece of wood to keep the jack from 
gouging up the engine block.

You can squeeze the hose shut with medical forceps (I believe that is what 
they are called) but I have heard that this will split or weaken the rubber.

I use either a Phillips head screwdriver or a pencil. If need be I use a 
hose clamp to squeeze the hose down on the pencil.

Be sure that your rubber lines have at least a grommet any place where a 
rubber hose passes through the sheetmetal.
