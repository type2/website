Subject: master cylinder replacement report

Barry,

I wound up ordering from the busboys as the busdepot was too much shipping for my time frame (east/west coast) and they were out of stock on the m.c. anyway.

The Brazilian Varga master cylinder was apparently good quality.

From the busboys:

211-611-021AABR  Master Cylinder, Brazil Bus/Pickup 71-79 USA
(Models with Power Brake Servo) $39.95

It did come with the o-ring but it was round in cross section, not square like my vw/audi original. Also, the o-ring seemed to sit high on the face of the mounting flange rather than recessed in a square groove like the vw/audi. It seemed smaller in diameter as well.

I installed my exist'g brake light switches and the fit was snug and they functioned.

Despite one of my brake lines having poor threads, they both threaded eventually, I have not checked for leaks yet as it's only been two days.

Mounting to the booster was square and true, and there was about 1/2" of fluid in the bottom of my booster, maximum allowable per Karl.

(Let's get this mail server fixed before we lose Karl!)

There is no weep hole on the brazilian m.c.! Yes, the fabled weep hole, preserver of brake boosters, and the main indicator that mine had failed is lacking on the varga m.c.'s. Worth it to go $127.00 for german? Maybe.

After installing new varga rear wheel cylinders and (?) shoes, the braking is excellent. Better than I have ever had since ownership.

Billy
