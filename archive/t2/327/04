Sure. I have seen people make one out of the bug oil bath air cleaner!
Otherwise, yeah its a little wood stove. But I have always wondered
just what are you going to burn in there? Kindling? How warm could it be
for any length of time? Still I have seen a few, and frankly, they would be 
safe
enough if you were not moving. I cant imagine them being safe while driving.
On the other hand, they would be safe while stopped, because they will
consume oxygen thats then exhausted out, drawing  fresh air in. So you will
need a not very well sealed bus, or an open window
