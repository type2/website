Subject: Radio installation in a 78

Hi Everyone!,

About 2 months ago I was able to salvage an original Volkswagen radio from 
a junk yard. I gave it some TLC, hooked it up to my 12v tester battery and 
it works great. Now I need to install it. The previous owner had a stereo 
installed that he claimed used to work. When I removed the stereo there 
were wires everywhere. I think I have found the "power" wire and have 
connected it to the radio. I purchased a new 4in speaker from Radio Shack 
and installed it nicely in the dash. To make a long story short... it does 
not work. Anyone have any idiot's guide to car radio installation? I have 
never installed one before and it seems straight forward.

By the way... it has been a long time since I posted. This is because I 
archive all the posts here at home and while fixing "Bess the Bus" I just 
search my own home archive and have found the correct leads each time.
Thanks to everyone for all their advice!

"Bess the Bus" lives!
