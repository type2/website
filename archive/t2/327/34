Now, do keep in mind that if you use a vice-grip for this it will use
up a vice-grip point. And as we all know you can only use up a few
vice-grip points and then the remainder of the grips you own (it could
be hundreds) will suddenly dissapear, not to be found until after the
job at hand is completed. :)

those of you who are always one vice-grip short while working on your
bus will understand this theory.
