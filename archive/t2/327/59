Subject: AC in '74 Bus

Hello Folks,

I have been reading all the post from this list and am gaining great knowledge
from all the post. My question is this: I noticed that my '74 Bus has A/C.
(right now the bus is not running, this is a project for me) Should I worry
about hooking up the A/C? Does anyone out there have working A/C systems on
their buses?

Thanks,
