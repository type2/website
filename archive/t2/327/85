tis a bit of work, need to get FI gas tank (or modify the existing tank)
what I have done with the older 1700, 1800 engines is use the FI from a
type IV sedan or wagen, more avaliable, cheaper  (71/72 411 was 1700,
73/74 412 was 1800) these are different types of FI so get all the parts,
it is not interchangable with the 2liter bus FI.
