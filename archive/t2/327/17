Subject: Zodi hot shower

hello

anyone here has installed or used a Zodi  hot shower here??

there is a site that has tested the product:
http://www.off-road.com/dunes/products/zodi/oct_2000/


But i wonder if we could easily replace the 6 V pump with a 12 V Bilge one
....

i already have a shower on my westfalia:

look at the bottom, the picture before my westy tent is a shower i made (my
brother in law is a welder and machinist, they do this in 5 min) we remove the
circle from the socket when moving... we put a curtain when we use it (or if
in deep wood we stay naked no curtain)

until now we were using a solar shower, but sometime it stay cool, when there
is no sun, so im thinking to adapt the Zodi hot shower to the westy... since
the roof is higher than ground i bet the 6 V wont be sufficient (we keep the
water tank on the luggage rack)

any input or idea to improve Shower is welcomed!!!!

(if anybody want the aluminium shower ask me should be cheap)
