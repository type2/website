I have several in my 78 and have put them in a pod on top of the
dashboard, looks almost stock.

they are quite simple and inexpensive, almost all of the vendors on this
list sell them, I don't know if any of them would ship to Italy, also 
all that I have seen have non metric markings on them so they would not
show indications that you are used to, but you could make a small scale
that could be taped over the bottom to give you a conversion

most all can be done in a parking lot, best time is during an oil change
for the oil temp/presure gauges.  if you want a sump sender it requires
drilling one hole in the cover plate, although these can be bought
predrilled and just bolted on, the presure sender works in place of the
oil light switch, un screw it and screw in the sender...slightly different
mounting for the upright and type IV engine.

the rest of the guages just wire into existing wires or connections

Good luck
