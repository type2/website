Subject: Re: [T2] undercoat

Pressure wash your undercarriage then paint with Kool Patch ...this is a
black roofing patch compound that is like thick pudding and smears on with a
brush and can be cleaned up with alcohol before it dries.

I did my 1982 Westie about five years ago and it still looks like new
underneath.
