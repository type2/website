the web is the Swiss headquarters and they don't list US distributors.

Domestic wax/oil (not WaxOyl):

One lb. candle wax
1/2 gal. mineral spirits/turps
Mineral oil (from the drug store)

Cheese grate the wax into the mineral spirits, stirring, stirring.
Cover and keep in a warm (not hot - flammable mixture !) place.
Stir regularly until the wax is thoroughly dissolved into the min-
eral spirits.
Thin with Mineral oil to usable consistency (brush or garden sprayer)

Yes it "does" work as a rust "preventative", but when summer returns
you will find the bus weeping the mixture if it gets really hot...

YMMV, of course...
