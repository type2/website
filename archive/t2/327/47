Subject: Re: [T2] undercoat

I'd go with the bar and chain oil. I do mine twice a year ( spring & fall )
soak it, anywhere you can get it, inside the frame rails especially. It's
been 3 years and the rust has not progressed. Tar ( Kool Patch ) scares me
'cause you can't see what's going on underneath the stuff!
