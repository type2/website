Subject: 75 Westy Troubles Advice Needed

I am a newbie to the World of Fuel Injection That Said :

The story - A few months ago I was coming north from Sunny Florida and ran
into a problem. While driving I noticed a slight buck/surge felt like it
lost all power and then recovered. Pulled over and had the idle going up and
down - almost to the point of stalling and then catching itself and running
smooth. Shut her down and left it alone for a few minutes fired up and I was
on my way. No trouble - did it every once in a while and then passed.

Problem kept showing up once in a while. Changed the fuel filter checked all
vac lines everything fine. Did it occasionally - figured it was time for a
good tune up. 

Slowly became more frequent. Did a minor tune up - points, plugs condensor-
checked everything else. No other problems then pitted points and some
carbon on the plugs. Same problem. Ignition seemed good so started with fuel
injection. Changed the Cyl head temp sensor, no better in fact becoming
worse. 
The bus now starts fine but stalls when ever not feeding fuel. Acceleration
feels very heavy-  Idles fine when first started and then after warm idles
up and down catches itself right before stalling.
After running for while it will stall and I have a tough time restarting -
if it sits it powers up fine. Strong odor of fuel. Carbon on all plugs.
Tested the injectors 2 bad and a leaking Cold start valve. Replaced but
still having the same problem - very mushy and up and down idle. No power
and very rich. 

I have not tested the coil or gone any futher with the injection. I am
hoping to get some suggestions at what to check next. I am starting to look
at the Air Flow meter as the culprit.  Any thoughs, directions or advice
will be appreciated.
