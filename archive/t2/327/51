Maybe easier to import a double door from Europe. German border patrol
(Bundesgrenzschutz) had quite a number of them. Should not be impossible
to find one and shipping is only $900. A lot of the "Grenzer" also came
with a large sunroof. Nice combination - office style interior, double
sliding doors, and huge sunroof.

If you want to tackle the conversion, I can help you with good left
door. A friend in Germany has a bunch, but no double door buses to put
them in.

Has anyone ever tried to convert a LHD bus with RH Slider to a double 
slider.  I know that anything is possible with $$$ but how feasible is 
this?  Snowed in with 30 + inches in Harpers Ferry, WV and just dreaming
;0)
