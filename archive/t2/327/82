Subject: Fuel injection transplant

How much of a PITA is it to put a F.I. engine from a
79 bus into a 72 bus? How much stuff is associated
with the FI that would have to be transplanted? How
easy is it to re-wire the FI engine into the 72 bus?
Can the FI brain simply be transplanted and connected
to 12 volts in the 72 bus or is it MUCH more involved
than that?
