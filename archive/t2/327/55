 Good point.  The vacuum connection is a large nipple just below the
carburator flange on the one-year-only '71 manifold.  Often another engine
gets transplanted in with bodged vacuum connections to the smaller ports.

There is a DP manifold kit that you can buy, probably Empi, that has a place
on the casting below the carburetor where you can drill, tap, and place a
threaded brass nipple. That's what we did.
