Subject: Bellows, Red Silicone Seals

Hi.

Anybody have a source for the red silicone seals that fit both sides of the 
hot (warm) air bellows on the Vanagon??

I would like to replace the asbestos rings on my '72 Westy's bellows, and I 
can not find them.

Part number??

BTW, I would be willing to swap a rebuilt , never installed, Beetle 
('67-'77) Master Brake Cylinder for a set of four red silicone seals if 
anybody has easy access to a Vanagon.

TIA
