This is the Temp Sensor II. Part of the FI system. It should be hooked
up if there is a FI system in your bus. This is not an item that can
be just disconnected if you want the bus to run well.

not the temp sender you are thinking of. Check the list vendors for
more stuff, but essentially the head temp sender and gauge are sold as
a unit and it has a ring which can be used to hook up the sender from
the spark plug, other people have bolted it directly to the head
through various ways. Then the wires are run to the front of the
bus (usually) and connected to the gauge.
