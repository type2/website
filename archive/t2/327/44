just hang in there. Once running correctly a FI system is fantastic.
You just have to suffer through all the POs who neglected the system.

Just to cover a base or two, what did you set your timing to? What
about dwell?

This part sounds kinda like a fuel delivery problem, but a few months
ago I got a rebuild AFM for my bus. Turns out that the machine they
apparently calibrate it with was bumpkus. I had the same symptoms when
changing it out. I didn't run it long enough to tell if it was running
rich from the plugs, but the horrible and slugish effects were about
the same.

All the same, you really should test the FI system per the bentley. It
really only takes a FI pressure gauge in addition to your regular
tune-up tools. Try to verify if the system is getting enough pressure
and if not why not (clogged tank/filter/bad regulator). If you
eliminate this you really help eliminate a lot of the FI system as
being suspect. Bentley has a fantastic section on this.

If the fuel delivery checks out, then check the AFM. How does it
compare w/ specs. This is a pretty simple check w/ a VOM.

I kinda think your guess is correct w/ the AFM. But it's a pricy part
to just guess at. Good luck and report back with anything you find.
