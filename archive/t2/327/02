Hmm. in the later type 2's the tranny is supported (well sort of compared
to an early bus that support is minimal. On my drag bug I have a tranny
support bracket and an engine support bracket.

But more importantly,  a rear engine support bracket is used that is not
connected to the oil pump. The oil pump support is just silly, and is not
recommended. If you have a type 1 case, make sure it can use a real
support bracket. Often you can tap and die one to make it so.
