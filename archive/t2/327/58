Subject: Temp Gauge

Hello

I have recently installed a new VEGE engine to my camper.  I would like to
fit some sort of Temp gauge just in case of problems.  I have seen a number
of products on the market such as, a dipstick that reads the Oil temp and an
Oil temp gauge that has a sender unit to a dial you can mount on the dash or
a cylinder head temp gauge that can also be mounted on the dash.

Does anyone out there have any advice on what maybe the best product for my
needs?

Thanks
