Subject: undercoat

I know this topic has gone around and around but I'd like to take it up once
more. The archives weren't that helpful.
I've got a '71 that's still pretty solid but the "undercoating" that looks
original is almost like a thick paint that comes off in big flakes. I've
spend some time under there the last few weeks and I'm seriously considering
some kind of treatment. After removing the remaining  loose undercoating
I'll put something better on.

I'd appreciate opinions on the best way to do this. I've heard that Waxoyl
is very good but then I've also heard that Agway or Husquarvarna bar oil
works well.  How about a US source for Waxoyl. The only one I've found on
the web is the Swiss headquarters and they don't list US distributors.
Thanks in advance,
