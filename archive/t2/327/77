Thank you, yes.  Or at least resists higher temperatures better.

Yes again, and 15W50 summer, 10W30 winter.

Yes, stock 2-liter with dual carbs.  Being in Texas, my engine is subjected to high ambient temps six months out of the year.  Fortunately, there aren't a lot of big hills, or it would run even hotter.  In the winter, it seldom goes over 200 degrees.
