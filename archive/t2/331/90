this is a very religous issue with many differing opinions however most
agree that it is easier to remove the auto tranny engine without removing
the tranny,  couple reasons, the auto tranny is dang near as heavy as the
engine, and the engine does not have to come back as far to clear the
tranny as there is no long shaft sticking out

I do it alone with one of those harbor freight $50 tranny jacks, although
I think I will pony up for a hyd one soon

also with the auto tranny the linkage is different and can be screwed up
really easy with the tranny in, and it is very NLA (most pieces)

vice grips work too, use carefully so as not to mess up the bolt heads
