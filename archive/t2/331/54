My `77 still has it's covers, but their very, very brittle.  Not impossible
to cast, but a lot of preparation.  They appear to be made from plastic.
Giacomo graciously allowed me to remove his for inspection.

Are these common to other year buses, or specific to each bus?

Are they truly NLA?  Off the top of my head, I'm looking at about $3500.00
worth of tooling costs to produce them (to give you something to compare
with, the long mirror stem tooling costs are around $2950.00).  It takes
forever to recover tooling costs...

I'd hate to put that much into them, only to find out that someone else has
either OEM, repro, or junkyard parts available.
