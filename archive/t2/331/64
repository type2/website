When the vehicle is off, gas fumes can get into the vacuum hoses.  Gas
will make the heater hose brittle and crack.  Do it right the first time

It should not be all that hard to find the 15/32 SAE vacuum hose.  I just
walked into my FLAPS and asked for it.  Here is a web site that describes
it:

If the corner FLAPS doesn't have it, I'm sure that a full line FLAPS like
NAPA would.
