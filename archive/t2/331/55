You don't want to use heater hose.  Gas fumes will attack the rubber and
the vacuum might collapse it.

There is a inch-sized vacuum hose available that is within thousandths of
the metric original.  I don't have my bus handy, but good vacuum hose is
definitely out there and not uncommon  Check your FLAPS.
