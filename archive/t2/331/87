John --

Don't pull the tranny.  You'll have to go through the axel removal procedure.  Pulling the engine is actually pretty easy.  Just support it with plywood on a floor jack, remove the flywheel flange bolts, pull back and lower.  You'll want to remove as much of the rear tin (front is front) as you can first though.  And the oil filler tube.
