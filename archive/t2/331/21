Subject: Free Surf / Kayak racks in So. Cal.

Hello fellow Bus pilots,
Thanks to Paul I now have a Westfakia poptop camper bus work in progress.
He donated his old poptop to my 71 Bus.
This means I had to remove my Surfboard / Kayak racks which are now available 
for the low low price of good Karma.
If you live in So. Ca. and need a set of 2ond hand racks p-mail me.
They will fit most any bay bus or minivan without a poptop, they clamp onto 
the rain gutter and are not fancy or vintage, just useful.
In the words of George Carlin regarding leftovers "I'm only going to Throw 
them away"

Cheers!
Tom 71' Westfakia "Rasputen"
