Subject: Re: [T2] bumper reflective tape

Did this one already,

Went to auto zone and bought an led "third" tailight for about
$18.  It is about 12 inches long.

super glued it to the top of the back window on the inside...almost looks 
stock<grin>...had to groove the gluing part so that it cleared the 
defrost strip.

Drilled a hole in the window frame and ran it inside to the hole close to 
where the defrost wire goes up the window(78 bus).

Very bright and high on the bus...and inside!

Cheers, dave
