Don't forget the extra 100 bucks for obstructing the highway with the
slow moving Bus--:>)

bumper reflective tape
Well, I suppose you are right about the illegality of displaying the
orange triangle SMV sign... it's prohibited in Pennsylvania statutes
too...and perhaps other States too.
And to think that a dangerous outlaw like myself has been ranging free,
flatgrantly ignoring the laws, whilst indangering the population at
large!! I ought to just "turn in my bus pass" and retire before my
ignorance results in furthur damage to the list's perspective.
And, yikes! To think that I've traversed WV just a couple of months ago
without incident.
BTW: I did find this little blurb with FindLaw ... from the fines
imposed in
Yellowknife. Northwest Territory, Canada:
Unauthorized sign 127 $100.00
Insecure load 130 $100.00
Splashing pedestrian 131 $ 50.00
Obstructing Highway 132 $100.00
So, you can splash two pedestrians for the same cost as displaying an
Unauthorized sign on you vehicle, Eh?
