Subject: Re: [T2] 009 distributer question

OK gang.  So it seems that everyone is conclusive that the 009 is not right for my type 4 engine.  So let me ask this.  what distributor is?   I'll level with you all.  I am still learning, slowly.  Although I have been a VW owner/enthusiast for many years now,  I have a variation of Attention Deficit Disorder that makes anything numeric almost incomprehensible to me. I know it sounds stupid but its a real thing. Anyways what i'm getting at is that while you guys are talking about curves and ratios and such, I tend to get lost.  I dont understand the hard core mechanic launguage, but I want badly to learn.  My bus is my baby and I cant keep taking it to mechanics so if I ask questions that seem basic or even a little stupid.  bear with me.  Anyways, back to the tech stuff.  As far as distributor, what is my best bet.  also, any suggestons as to a coil and wires that would work well for me?
