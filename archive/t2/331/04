Subject: Re: [T2] bumper reflective tape

all slower moving "vehicles" are supposed to use those... here in OK
there are menonites that use and cross the highways when you get outside
town... they always have those orange reflective triangles on the back...
i always wondered where to get one for my bus... especially for
carabussing... so i suspect you wouldnt get ANY hassle from cops (on
account of it being a warning to other drivers that you are slower...
like the horse-drawn-carriages)

waving and looking for some serious reflection (especially with all the
A-holes that drive with their brights on!),
