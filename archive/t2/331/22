I've seen Halogen 1156/1157s for sale but haven't tried them, again, because
of the cost.

I tried one of those halogen 1157 ulbs on my motorcycle's tailight a couple 
years ago. At first it worked great, but then one saturday night as I was 
getting ready to ride sunday am, there was no light on the tail. The bulb 
wasn't blown, it would light if i pushed it in and turned it. Of course that's 
kind of hard to do after you put the lens cover on and start riding. :-) I 
replaced the halogen bulb with a plain old 1157 tailight bulb and have not had 
any problems. I guess the bulb wasnt an exact enough fit. 
I still have the halogen taillight bulb, I think I might try it in the bus 
someday. If it works continuously I may buy another one.
