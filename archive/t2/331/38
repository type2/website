Subject: brake booster hose

Another job that I need to do too.

Busboys has the correct hose with a metal spring wound inside it.

Remember it has vacuum pressure on it, so you won't get away with some garden hose rig.

Not cheap about about 10.71/ft as I recall.

I need to replace the vacuum hoses for the brake
booster on our '71 bus.  The closest thing I can find locally is 1/2
inch heater hose.  It is thick walled and seems to have a fabric
reinforcement embedded in the middle of the rubber.
Does anyone have a source for the proper hose?  If not, what have
some of you used?
