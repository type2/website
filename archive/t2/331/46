People "bore out" 1700's to 1800's or even to 1900's, but to get to 2.0 generally requires switching to the 2.0 crankshaft, which has a 5mm longer stroke than the 1.7-1.8 crankshaft.

As others have mentioned, there is no easy way to determine the displacement without at least partially disassembling the motor.
