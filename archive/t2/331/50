Subject: more carb discussion

Hi All,

I've been looking at my '72 bus again lately...  I need a carb or two.  The 
previous owner installed a double barrel single solex carb in the bus.  I 
have tried to get a rebuild kit for this carb, but nobody I've shown has ever 
seen it before.  It needs a rebuild because rubberized bits have 
disentregated.  So I think it is a paperweight.  My boyfriend just gifted me 
with one double barrel Weber carb (not sure which model) that he found in the 
trunk of his squareback.  I am not sure it will fit, but will check.  Should 
I attempt to make it work?  The key thing here is not performance, but 
Money.  I don't have enough to spend hundreds of dollars on the "right" 
carb.  If neither of these carbs work, does anyone know of where to get a 
really inexpensive setup?  If not, what should I buy for it?

Thanks for the input,
Jennifer
