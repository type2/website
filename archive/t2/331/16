My idea regarding LED taillights is to drill a stock lens for the LEDs so
that the focusing lens of the LED protrudes and aims the beam straight
rearward.  On the inside of the lens would be a short wiring harness that
ends in a "bulb base" plug that will plug into the stock socket.  One set
of LEDs will handle the tail light function.  Another will handle the
stop/turn function.  The two sets will be in different parts of the lens
so that brake/turn function will be more obvious.

Not quite stock-appearing, but it will be bright.

Trying to get LEDs to act like the incandescent bulbs inside the stock
housing doesn't seem to work well.  I've seen quite a few attempts, but
none really successful.  LEDs are different critters!
