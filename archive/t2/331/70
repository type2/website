I had a whole lot of extra wires to run from the front of The Carcass to 
the rear--
for stuff like gauges, back-off lights, heavy 12V+ cable, etc.  The stock 
harness
runs through a tube on the driver's side, so I added one on the passenger side.
I used a ten foot length of 1/2" galvanized electrical conduit held to the 
undercarriage
with the rubber lined strap clamps, also found in the electrical section, 
of you favorite
home & garden center.  Over in the sprinkler department, they have this 
black plastic
flexible hose that juuuuuuuust fits inside the conduit.  I stuck a length 
about an inch
into each end, and fastened with electrical tape (the expensive, quality 
stuff).
The plastic hose keeps the wires from abrading on the edge of the conduit, and
keep water and road crud out of the it.  The other end of the front piece goes
through a drilled and grommetted hole up into the area behind the nose of 
the bus,
and the rear piece, through a drilled and grommetted hole into the engine 
compartment.

If you're the sort that places mirrors on the ground under your bus, you 
won't be
happy with the "look"--but it works just fine.

Now I wish I'd used 3/4" conduit, so I'd have room for a large ground cable 
to improve
the grounding of the headlights..................
