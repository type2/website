Subject: Brake Booster Hose - GOT IT

Hi Folks,
    First let me thank all of you who responded to my call for help.
THANK YOU.  By expaning the radius of my search, and going to parts
houses I usually don't frequent, I found what I need.  I came home
with 15/32 inch vacuum hose.
    Now, if only the snow would go easy on us tonight, maybe I can
finish up this engine installation.  It seems I've spent more time
shoveling snow away from our bus than working on it.
