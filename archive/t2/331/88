Subject: Re: [T2] more carb discussion

Hey all,

Thanks for the helpful advice!! A listee has a set of OE solex carbs and 
linkage in my price bracket.  I'll rebuild them and hopefully be a happy 
camper (quite literally :) ).  I'm filing the dellorto advice and if I don't 
like the solexes, I can save my money for them.  FI is a scarey thing to me - 
probably irrationally so, but either way, I'm comfortable with carbs. 

Thanks again,
Jennifer
