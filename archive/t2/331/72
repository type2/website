Plastruct has acrylic rods in clear and in 4 neon colors (re. blue, green &
yellow).  I believe that the rods are 10" in length.  You can get them
through almost any hobby retailer (hobby shop).

A quick tip on cutting it with a saw: Keep a little bit of water on the
blade to keep the rod cool during cutting.  You'll get granular "sawdust"
instead of melting the rod and bogging the cutting blade down (mind that you
are careful about the water if you use an electrically powered cutting
tool!).
