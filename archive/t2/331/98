Subject: CVS clamps and half axles

I am pulling the tranny and motor and have removed the half axles. 
Besides replacing the tranny one of the things I needed to do was fix 
leaking CV boots. The boots look in excellent shape. However, 3 of the 
4 are throwing grease every where from the narrow ends (what a muck 
fess!!!). I read that older busses (mine is a 79) used clamps. Any one 
use hose or other clamps on newer buses? A couple more questions:
1) I heard no grinding or problematic noises from the CVS - I should be 
OK just repacking with grease and using these right?
2) If using clamps is not a good solution, then is it more expensive to 
have the CVS pressed off put new boots on and then have the CVS  
pressed on than buying the half axles that bus depot is selling? TIA
