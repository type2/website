Be careful you aren't sucking exhaust into the heating system through 
leaking heater boxes or engine seals. There is a reason the factory put the 
blower BEFORE the heater boxes. Any leaks in the outer boxes lets clean air 
OUT vs. possibly sucking exhaust IN when you are in slow traffic.

Not to mention the bildge blowers most people use are rated only for 176F 
(per the box). By putting them before the heater boxes they should last 
forever versus the $20 replacement every year or two.

YMMV.
