Absolutley correct George--
An SMV is limited to slow moving Farm, Excavating and Amish horse drawn
vehicles only--at the rate of speed you mentioned.
Displaying one of these on any other vehicle at a higher rate of speed
is not only dangerous, but good for a good sized fine--
I think if you display anything in a triangular form in any color--will
just confuse the mad men who are climbing up your butt all the
more---stay with the red and white DOT approved tape--
Later,

Terry

Be aware, however, that you can be cited for displaying this emblem if
you drive faster than 25MPH. It's really made for tractors, bicycles,
Amish buggys, etc.
OTOH, if you make one in a color other than orange (fluorescent green
leaps to mind) it is no longer a "slow moving vehicle emblem" and not
subject to the regulation.
