Mike,

But look at the price that the folks with pre 68 ones for sale(new).

We used to do a lot of sheet plastic vacu-forming at Volkswagen Product 
Corp. once we had the molds.  Couple of router cuts and bingo, new 
parts...  

Then ask for pmail from folks about how many of us would want a pair at
x price....you might be surprised!

I got a "decent" pair to go on my 78 and the only difference I can see
is that older buses must have used an extra screw along the bottom edge 
that the 78 did not.  I did take the decent pair and fiberglass them on 
the inside so they would continue to hold together for awhile.

The plastic that vw made them out of must not have been UV safe...


Cheers, dave
