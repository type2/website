Subject: RE: [T2] Frustration in Florida

Lucky indeed...South Carolina is no better..!  ANYWHERE on the East coast is
rust atmosphere.  I grew up in Jersey.  Never even saw an early model, till
I moved to Florida.  You see, Florida allows a less stringent rule on body
condition.  No inspection prior to like 75.  So there were a few early
beetles, but very few busses. Rust, Rust, Rust...
