I just got ahold of someone with clue at Espar and he's going to send
me the manual. This should help a lot. A couple previous calls to them
got me nowhere.

I'll have the engine and gas tank out already, which is why this is such
a good time to install the heater. I have an air drill and a body saw, 
so I don't think that cutting the openings will be a problem. I was hoping
to get copies of the templates, but I'm sure I can either make some or
eyeball it.

OK, that sounds straightforward. My exhaust pipe is solid but rusty. I'm
thinking of having a new one fabricated out of stainless steel. I guess
that will depend on how much it would cost.

Thanks!
