Been there, done that.  Got some from superbrightleds.com.  They sell LED
"bulbs" that fit into the stock light sockets.  Unfortunately, they do not
appear to be up to the task.  First of all, they are not as bright as the
stock taillights (running, brake or blinker) especially from an angle.  The
1157 version doesn't seem to be much brighter on the high-intensity circuit,
so when the brakes are applied you can't tell much difference.  Finally, the
resistance of the LEDs are so high that the flasher does not work properly.
With the rear blinker bulb swapped for LED, the flasher goes double-speed
(indicating a bulb out).  If I were to replace the front blinker bulb as well,
I don't think the blinkers would work at all.  This could be addressed by
replacing the standard flasher box with an electronic version - I did this on
my Mustang.   That's why I was asking about the electronic flasher box a few
weeks ago.  I didn't get any replies on that so I assume nobody has done it.
Anyway I will probably be removing the LEDs from the taillights and using them
for interior lighting.
