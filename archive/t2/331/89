In my opinion, yes.

It is nearly impossible to do it alone, though. If you have a very good
lifting device, like one of those atv jacks, it can be done with one person.
Otherwise you need one or two helpers for the in and out. But with helpers
the install is super-easy. The biggest hangup on an engine-only install is
always the last 2 inches, this is not an issue if the engine and trans are
already together. The other advantage is that the entire engine, I mean
everything, stays with the engine for the install/pull taking the tin off
with the engine in the bus is a hassle especially if it is rusty. The
longest process is attaching/removing the cv joint hardware. If you have an
air ratchet, this is not an issue. I don't...

The only tricky part is access to the upper trans carrier bolts, it helps to
have some very long extensions to get at them, wobble ones are good here.
Again for this part, it is difficult/near impossible to loosen or tighten
these bolts with one person, as you can't be on both sides of the firewall
simultaneously. But there is a special tool for this job (which is also
excellent for the upper engine/trans bolts on an upright engine):

Or get a helper to hold the other end while you tighten or loosen.
