Subject: Remove engine AND tranny?

Hey Y'all,
I am mainly a T1 engine guy but I have been working on
building one good late bay out of 2, and I have
discovered that it is a pretty good PITA to remove the
pancake engine. So is it easier to remove the whole
engine and tranny as a unit? I heard someone write
this earlier, can anyone confirm or deny? Can you give
me a quick run-through of the procedure including any
issues that arose during the removal?
