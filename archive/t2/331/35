Subject: LED Lights

LED's are great! I replaced the Westy halogen overhead light bulb with three
white LEDs and a 47 Ohm resistor...I probably should have gone with two
strings of three  because three are a bit weak to replace the light output
from the halogen bulb.

I have designed a sailboat navigation light LED Array that that pulls 210 mA
and is visible from 2 or 3 Nautical Miles. I also see that Perko (makers of
nautical navigation lights) now offer some LED arrays. West Marine now
offers several different LED lighting fixtures for illumination of the
interior cabin.

Clearly, LED lighting is the wave of the future in all low-voltage
applications where low power drain, immunity to shock, and long life are
important.

As a quicky experiment, connect 3 white LEDs in series and add a 47 Ohm
resistor to the end and power it up on 12 volts.  You can do the same thing
with 4 red LEDs and get a nice red 12 volt light.
