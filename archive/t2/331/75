Subject: Re: [T2] Late loaf bumpers on early loaf bus

I know what you mean.  any 68-72 bumpers that I have found have been badly beat up or horribly over priced.  I kinda planned to get a nice set of nice chromed 73-79 bumpers for my 72 after i get all the mechanical stuff done first.  I'm sure the experts will reccomend cutting off the front clip of a 73-79 and welding it in to mount the bumper on or something like that.  What I planned on doing was one of two things.   since the early bumpers were rounded and the holes were slightly twards the top of the bumper the brackets are angled upwards slightly, if you just drilled new holes in the late pumper and bolted it on it would be at an angle so I was going to either put washers on the outermost bolt on the bumper bracket to lower it slightly, or putting a wedge type shim of wood or metal on the bolt between the late bumper and the upwarly angled bracket to level it out.  It may not win you any trophies but hey its what i am leaning twards.  Its my theory anyways
