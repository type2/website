Subject: F.I. to Carb conversion on late bay

--I agree with Bob, and John, you've got your own situation going and I respect that, but take it from the T4 guys, we all sort of die a little everytime we look at a 2L bus with a crappy carb job and no trace of the oem gear to be found.

--It's yours to do what you will, but really the f.i. system is not hard to work on (this was my first car!) and provides much better mileage/power.

--whatever you do, keep the old stuff in busdriver's hands.

Later,

billy
