I've read up on most attempts, but I'm going to try a different route, I
work in the transit industry and there are commercial grade LED lights
that have both running/stop in the same housing (check out the nearest new
transit bus) I am trying to make a new housing to replace the current
housing that will use the commercial LED's and fit behind the current
lens,  mostly because of NHTSA rules the lights I'm using are too big and
need to be cut down, that is where the challenge lies, they are real picky
about how they are cut down, not to mention they are pricey...I expect
based on current prices that it will cost $50-75 per side plus the work
involved but I want more light back there.
