No heat durring install. Don't want to stretch the vinyl then have it shrink
once glued down and come loose.

I dont know how they are counting 5 pieces. I actually count 6. The sides
have 4 pieces. If you look you can see where the two panels connect about
half way back. The rear side pieces flair at the back so the vinyl is a
little wider for the rear. The front over the seats and the bottom of the
top bunk bed board. 6 total.
