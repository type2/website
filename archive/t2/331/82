Subject: Overheating

I have a 1970 van which has developed a strange overheating problem. Last
Summer I completely overhauled the bodywork and removed the engine for a
clean, new wiring and new set of gaskets.
Ever since, I have had a problem with the running of the van after about
one hour of running. The revs will suddenly drop right off, sometimes cutting
out but often just idling. I have to pull off the road very quckly. The accelerator
pedal has no effect on revs. If I turn the engine off and wait 10 minutes,
she will get going again and run for approx 45 mins. Same deal, 10 minute
wait and off until the running time and waiting time are the same if not
worse.
The engine is extremely hot - pinging tinware, no way of holding dipstick
etc. I have changed oil several times. New coil, leads, plugs, condensor.
Retimed and distributor tightened up after found to be loose. This never
happened before and has now relegated my van to the roadside all winter and
I look like I might lose a summer unless I can fix it.
