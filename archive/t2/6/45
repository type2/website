Subject: Westy green plaid fabric question

Hello List,

Today, I went around town looking for bay busses
today. I found 4 of them. I put one of the fliers that
I made up advertising Type 2 under one of each bay's
windshield wipers. The last stop I made was to the
gentleman who I bought my bus from. I went in and
spoke to him awhile and looked at his daugthter's bus
and the work that she had done to it. I handed him a
flier. While I was there, he gave me a green plaid
westy coushin. This coushin is the back to the westy
bed. (not the coushin over the engine). It is in
fantastic shape. it is only missing one snap and the
others still have their un worn black paint on them.
The cover is bright not streched out. I think I will
hold on to it for now.

<Question>

I know that westy plaid frabric has been throughly
discussed but I wnated to know if there was any one
now that sold the westy green plaid fabric  for
coushins. I have searched the archives, and some of
the well know vw supliers.Pleas let me know if any one
does. I fear that I am opening up a can of worms.
sorry. Any help would be most appreciated!!!
