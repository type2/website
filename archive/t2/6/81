Subject: Further to Brake Drums, etc...

Thanks to all who promptly posted!  And special thanks to the folks who
pointed out that one mustn't remove the castellated nut to change the shoes,
cylinders.  (Someone should smack Bentley.)

Now, on to the 'further to'... Everything went well on a Sunday spent
changing front pads, rear shoes and rear wheel cylinders (lotsa leaking).  I
first had the rotors "checked" by a mechanic who indicated they were beyond
rotating and would need replacement.  Always wanting a second opinion, I
went off to another who said mine were fine for machining.  I smilingly paid
my $18, thanked myself for saving money, and went home.

Sadly, today's test drive revealed there is something still very wrong.
Right front wheel makes a rubbing sound periodically on the rotation, as if
the rotor were warped, and when I brake, wow! is there some noise.  I of
course bled everything before my test drive, and still there was what I
thought to be too much room before they started grabbing in the first place.

Are my rotors hosed?  Should I have listened to the first mechanic?  Or did
I somewhere fail horribly in my reassembly?

Cheers for prompt responses - need to have Petunia back on the road ASAP :(
