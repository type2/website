Everyone else's response to remove just the drum and not the hub was right
on...you only remove the hub to service the bearings. But! Measure the
castellated nut with a ruler and you should find that it's 46mm. 36mm nuts
(which you do have to remove to service the brakes, at least on a Type 1)
are found on Types 1, 3 and 4...not Type 2.

To get this off you need a 46mm (or 1 13/16", that works too) socket on a
3/4" or 1" drive breaker bar or impact wrench. (One-inch drive? Sears has a
one-inch drive socket set in their Craftsman catalog. It costs $800, so
unless you were a mechanic at an oil refinery you probably wouldn't need
one.)
