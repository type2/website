don't know where you are located but here in Baltimore there is a company
that rebuilds em, does a pretty good job, I've used em for over 25 years
and never had any kind of failure (gen, starters, alts.) but I don't think
they do mail order. and most everything is 24hr turnaround.  last starter
I took to them they went in the back room and came back handed me the
starter and said, no charge this one's good.

(I had just pick it up for a spare from a junkyard)
so check the yellow pages or ask around
