$800?????
Let's not make the neophytes nervous.  All you need is a 1-13/16"
socket.  3/4" drive is adequate.  Add to that an eighteen inch 3/4"
drive T-bar and you have everything you need.  Maybe some scrap pipe
for some extra lever arm.  

I bought mine at Sears fifteen years ago.  Probably cost less than
$30.  With all the import stuff out there, you could probably do
better than that today.  I never had to use any violence to remove
the big nut.  Just stand on the end of the T-bar, grab on the the
body and pull. I weigh about 175 pounds.  No hitting with the sledge
hammer required.
