Subject: Using vacuum distributor with Weber carburetor

It is possible to use a vaccuum advance distributor with either a Weber or
Holley 2-barrel progressive carburetor, provided there is a port at the
base of the carburetor for the advance vacuum. I have used both these carbs
on my
72 1700cc in combination with a 009, 050 and a dual vacuum/mechanical
advance distributor. I now run exclusively with the dual vacuum/mechanical
advance
distributor(reduced hesitation, more power when compared to the
mechanical-only distributors).
I have the advance hose connected from the vacuum canister to
the port at the base of the carburetor, and I leave the retard port on
the vacuum canister left open and unplugged. (There has been some discussion
on the list
regarding how to create vacuum for the retard, should be in the
archives)Should I prefer the curve of
the 009 or the 050 (very hot weather,  stop and go
traffic requiring high revs in first and second gear), I can simply
disconnect and plug the vacuum hose to the carb. (I believe this in effect
was originally accomplished
automatically by a vacuum cut-off valve in my bus. The cut-off valve, now
long gone,
allowed no vacuum advance when outside temps were over 50 while driving in
gears 1 thru 3, see Bentley).
Disconnecting the advance hose leaves me with a mechanical advance-only
distributor having a curve very
similar to either the 009 or the 050 with total advance of say, 28
degrees vs. the 42 degrees total advance (idle: 7.5 btdc) when  the vacuum
advance
hose is left connected.
