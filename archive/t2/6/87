Subject: green plaid upper bed cushion covers found

Hello list,

I just wanted to let you know that I found the bed
covers that I was looking for. I want to thank all of
you that looked to see if you had the covers but I
will not need them now. I am buying a set that Karl
had. Thanks for looking though!
