Subject: stuck 2 liter

Okay, I'm lazy, I'll admit it. The 2L 77 I bought has a stuck motor. Can
turn the engine over a quarter turn in each direction before it sticks
solid. Now if it were a 1600, I'd suspect a broken flywheel or something
lodged in the dist gear, but this was a running type 4 before this happened
and the engine appears too clean to have suffered lack of maintenance. As
this is my first type 4 I'm looking for the most common things or things
peculiar to type 4's, dropped valves,jammed flywheels, etc
thanks all
