here is a link to some pics of Mercedes wheels on a bus.

The 14" on the red panel fit easily.  Only had to drill out the wheels as
Mercedes uses a 12mm studs instead of 14mm.

The 15" chrome Mercedes wheels were a little more work.  We had to both
drill out the wheels and put longer wheel studs in.  I will post this
picture later on this evening.
