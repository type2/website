Subject: VW Trek Mt bike 4 sale or tradee

Hey folks, I was looking to trade this bike for an interior, but I have had a few requests to sell outright so here goes. I will now sell thhis bike for $325 or the trade that I reall y want, here's the details: VW Trek mountiain bike for trade or sell. Will trade for pre-68 bus camper interior or post-80 Vanagon camper interior or other VW trade. Remember when VW was giving away a free Trek mountain bike when you bought their new VW Jetta "Trek" edition? This is one of those bikes. It is a sweet black Trek 920 mountain bike, 21 speed, with the VW logo in several places. It has been used less than 15 times. Imagine how cool this would be attached to the back of your bus on your next camping trip. I really want one of the aforementioned camper interiors, but will consider any other VW trades (parts, buses, bugs, etc.) Let's do some bartering! Other interesting trade also considered!  Pix available on VW Planet, search using "trek" as key word.



Peace, John Baker
