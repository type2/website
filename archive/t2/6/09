yeah, i guess i thought i could figure out if there was vacuum
being created at half and full throttle, thinking that low or
unsteady readings would be indicative of something -- a vacuum leak
at the throttle bushing maybe?  

After doing this, I realized that if the dizzy was advancing properly,
I did in fact have vacuum at the vacuum advance port, but that was
only a qualitative, as opposed to quantitative, assessment.  

*shrug*

But yeah, it took me a minute to realize that the gauge needed to be
hooked up to the manifold port to get a reading, although I still don't
think I've found that port.  :)

true, true.

hmm.  Well, that's an interesting thought.  I'm pretty sure that I'm 
connected to the manifold vacuum port of my carb, but let me describe 
where I've got it connected.

The H30/31 Carb has, AFAICT, 4 vacuum ports.  If we're looking at the
carb from the rear (RIR, you're standing behind the bus looking at
the engine compartment), you see:

a)  1 vacuum port coming out the left side of the carb, just in front of
	the throttle lever

b)  2 vacuum ports (capped) adjacent to each other (on the same horiz. plane)
	at the throttle bushing level (ish).  These face the rear of the bus.
 
c)  1 vacuum port that is a pipe pointing down at a ~60deg angle into the base
	of the carb.  This faces the rear of the bus and is below the (b) ports.

I have my advance hose connected to (a) and my retard hose connected to (c).

I made the assumption that (c) went to the manifold because of it's location
and because http://www.type2.com/library/electrip/dvh.htm seemed to point
to this being the right port.

how'd i do?

List of things to check tonight:

- place finger over manifold port of carb to do a qualitative check for vacuum:
	my finger should stick to the port a wee bit, right?

- reconnect gauge to port i have confirmed is the manifold port of the carb w/o
	the t-connector (so the retard port of my dizzy can isn't attached to
	anything) -- confirm that I have a vacuum reading.  If I felt my finger
	stick but I have no reading, then maybe I got a bum gauge (teach me to
	spend $18 instead of more!)

- no vacuum reading?  seal off brake booster manifold port and check again.  if
	i get vacuum after this, i know that 1' of booster hose i didn't replace
	yet is bad and perhaps the source of my probs.  

- if i get a vacuum reading with just the gauge attached to the carb (not the
	dizzy), attach the dizzy again using the t-connector:  i should get the
	same reading

- with gauge and dizzy connected to carb's manifold vacuum port, seal off brake
	booster manifold port and see if reading changes.  If so, i still could
	have a problem either with my booster or with that last foot of booster
	hose.


doh, or as steve just wrote, i could hook up my gauge (and dizzy) to the vacuum
port on my intake manifold that i've got capped.  maybe i should do that anyay.
