Actually, I think my idle speed adjustment is lower than spec (850 RPM,
IIRC), so my intent is to correct it to spec.  If the oil pressure light is
on after doing that, so be it.

Russell,

Your replacement is probably a sort of generic aftermarket unit that the
manufacturer sells as a replacement for as many engine applications as
possible to maximize sales and profit.  If you compared the stats on the
contact closing threshold of the replacement unit and the correct, stock
sender unit, the numbers are probably not the same.

I personally wouldn't set the idle incorrectly just to cover up the behavior
of an incorrect sender unit.  Two "wrongs" do NOT make a "right"!
