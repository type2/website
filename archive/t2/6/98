Subject: Head temp sensor question, 2liter acvw

Volks,
I was helping a fellow listee with a new bus he just bought this past
weekend...........82 vanagon.......perfect body, minor engine issues.

Previous owner took bus to "Spirit of the wind" a place near Asheville, NC
stay clear of them.

The bad..........."Spirit of the Wind"  put heads on the van.......off of a
pre 79 motor..............thus deciding that the owner of the van would have
no need for heat, and removing ALL  heat tubes, alternator fan cover,
thermostat, flaps, etc.  put old round port heat exchangers on it with
attached old worn-out muffler that the tail pipe was broken off
of..........the heat shield is missing, and naturally the engine seal was
half heartedly put back..........sorta hard for an air-cooled engine to
actually cool under these conditions........and NOTHING was cleaned during
this work...valve covers so filthy you could not believe it......with at
least 4 ounces of grease in each one I believe they could not spend the $2
for a new cork gasket....

Well, diagnosed problem where engine would run, and then die out once
warm............."spirit of the wind" drilled a hole in the head for the
head temp sensor(fi engine) then SILICONED it in.............

Well, he tried to drill in #3 and #4 cylinder, and apparently did not hear
of a helicoil, or tap and die set........thus drilled a big hole and
siliconed it in.

Any fix other that a helicoil in this situation?  On number 1 and 2
cylinder the holes are not there......
