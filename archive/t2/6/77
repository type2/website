Subject: Transporting a bus

Hello everyone,
A friend of mine just moved back to Shreveport from Phoenix.  In the process
he left behind his bus which had an engine failure and didn't have the
time/money to fix it.  I'm looking for experiences and tips from persons who
have had a vehicle transported by truck.

Thanks,
Darren
