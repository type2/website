Here is the address for the existing list flyer

http://www.type2.com/~andy/flyer.jpg

It was made up last summer, i believe, and I've kept a stack of them in 
my westy. Gave one to a guy who turned out to watch the shuttle launch 
at Cape Canaveral. I put a little flyer of my own on the back for buses 
around my area. It has my email address, and a little note saying to 
drop me a line if you ever need help.

Anyway, it's a good flyer. Make a stack for your bus, too.
