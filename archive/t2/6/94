The type 4 engine is a well designed beast, however it was originally
designed for a 411& 914, both of which are hard to kill in stock foem, and
both of which have problems ever getting the oil hot enough to rid
contaminants..

Face it, you have a 5,000 pound bus, most cars of that weight are V8
powered..

And yes, I'm one of those guys who believes in external coolers, and also
one who shuts engines down at 235 oil temp.....Thats OK, my bus averages
185, most of the time, but it does take 7 qts to fill it up.. just wait till
it gets the dry sump, and CIS with a turbo this winter!!

Actually my Powerstroke engine ran 220 oil temp all the time without the
extrenal cooler, I added it for pulling all the weight of my trailer and
engine parts bins, and even engines..especially when climbing grades..

BTW almost every thermostat I see is not functioning correctly, and the oil
cooler is only getting 1/2 of what it should be with proper adjustment..
