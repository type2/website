If you had that big of a vacuum leak, the engine wouldn't even come close 
to running.  If you're not getting any vacuum at idle, you're probably 
connected to the carb (which would be used for vacuum advance), not the 
manifold vacuum.  Somewhere, you should be able to get a reading for 
manifold vacuum if the engine is idling.
