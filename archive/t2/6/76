Subject: fuel and vacuum line routing diagram?


I am trying to re-assemble/install the stock 2 carburetor system on a 74 bus. 
 I am starting with 2 boxes of parts representing three complete systems from 
2 different model years and I have not had much luck in locating a 
diagram/picture of where to route the fuel and vacuum lines.  

I believe I have all the compontents and can no doubt cobble it all together; 
I would, however, LIKE to do it in as correct a manner as possible.  Can 
anyone direct me to any good web pages that would supplement what I find in 
Bentley?

thanks

mark
