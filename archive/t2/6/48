Subject: Weber help

Going to attempt a rebuild of my prgressive Weber carb tomorrow.

The instrucctions with the kit give no specs for use with the VW motors. 
Is there somewhere I can get this info?  I need to set if up to work
porperly on my 1800.

Any other tips on working with this carb/engine combo?

Thanks,
