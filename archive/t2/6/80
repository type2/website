Subject: Green Plaid cushion covers for top westy bed 

Hello List!

I am looking for green plaid cushion covers for the
two top bed cushions that are in excelent, non-faded,
unstained, unworn condition. I am using them for
recovering seats and westy bed cushions so I do not
care if the snaps or zipper are damaged. I just need
them for the fabric. I have a price in my mind that I
am willing to pay for each one. Let me know if you
have one or two in this condition and let me know how
much you want for each and I will see if it is close
to the price that I can spend. Also, a picture would
be great if that is not too much to ask. I only need
the covers so to keep the shipping cost at a minimum. 
Thanks for your time! Thanks for all that help that
you have given me so far!!!

Reguards,
David Kelly
