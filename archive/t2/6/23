Sounds lean. Check your intake nuts for tight and runner seals/hoses.

Verify pressure and volume from pump.

Like I said, sounds lean. Verify float level. Then reset mixture.

Compression test. Verify that always before ignition or fuel systems, just
to be sure.

Verify pressure and volume, but I already said that.

Not necessarily, but verify volume and pressure, then float level. Did this
carb come off a 1300?? Verify jet sizes while your in there verifying the
float level.

Just a lean idle mix can cause this symtom, but rule out air leaks before
the fuel system is ruled guilty.

This could even be as simple as just adjusting richer. Does standard
mixture adjustment respond properly. Idle drops when turned in and rises
when turned out??? Turn the mixture screw out half a turn and see if things
cool down and power comes back.
