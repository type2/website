Subject: Why VW's leak -- attempt II



For some reason it didn't work the first time...



It's Friday so I thought I would share some insight to why VW's leak. This 
concept was originated by Jim Isbell on the Corvair list and he originally 
applied it to a Jaguar...

<snip>

Well.......in the case of Jaguars, that have a reputation as leakers, we
have come up with the answer. They don't really leak oil. Its just
that the Jaguar is such a desirable car that oil in the ground wants to
get into the car. It seeps up in the ground and makes a puddle under
the car. Then as it jumps up at the oil pan trying to get in it messes
up the bottom of the engine.
Another answer that some un informed people use is that it is the
Jaguars "designed in" anti rust system.
You heard that Jaguar tried to make refrigerators after the war but gave
up because they couldn't figure out how to make them leak oil, right?

<unsnip>

I think it applies to VW's too.

Another fellow suggested that the Brits drink warm beer because they have 
Lucas refrigerators...

I think I see a trend.. <grin>
Ciao!
