Even easier way to remove the center nut is to take your bus down to the
local tire store where they do truck tires...have them put the 1" impact
on it, and buzz it off...clean up the surfaces, and coat the threads
with a good anti-seize...put the nut back on, tight enough that you can
remove it at home (I do this by hand) and put another cotter pin back
in...pay the guy a few bucks, and go back there next time you need
tires...it builds good Karma with the locals...

Good luck...Den.
