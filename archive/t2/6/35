Subject: Door Seal Fit

Hey Folks,
      Just put a new door seal on the passenger door on the '77, and , no
surprise, it's too thick. Had the same problem with seals I put on my '76
three years ago. Door shuts, but not without extreme force. I searched the
archives and see many have had the same problem, but didn't find a
resolution. Anyone successfully trim one of these to where it fit AND still
sealed the door? The inner portion of the seal is shaped like a "V", and it
would appear that if I trimmed the inner portion of the "V" it may fit
better, or trash the seal.  TIA, Jeff
