Subject: Debugging an Engine that's running Hot

Right.

Scenario:

My new, 1600DP, H30/31 carb, vacuum dizzy, alternator engine is still 
running hotter than I like when I get on the highway:  218-228 while 
cruising between 50-57 mph.  Timing is on, carb is adjusted (AFAICT).
All vacuum hoses are new, valves are adjusted.

Things I have observed:

- idle fluctuates +/- 25-50 rpm after warmed up

- inline fuel filter is consistently empty (is this indicative of
	anything, perhaps that there's an issue with the fuel pump?)

- engine advances normally (roughly 20-28 degrees of total advance)

- seemingly a little low on power, compared to previous engine running
	H30/31 Carb 

Things I've tested:

- i have sprayed wd40 on all the potential vacuum leak areas I can think of:
	- port/head connections
	- carb base
	- O-ring gaskets that connect the carb stand to the intake manifolds
		(is that terminology right?)

	and have not seen/heard/felt a change in idle after dousing those
	areas with more WD40 than I can think of

- bought a cheap-o vacuum gauge (just for testing) and connected
	it (with a t-connector) to:
		- vacuum advance port of the carb: < 5 cm3 vacuum (-at-) full throttle
		- vacuum retard port of the carb: < 5 cm3 vacuum

Thoughts:

Hypothesis #1: 

H30/31 is not the correct carb for the 1600DP and is too lean (-at-)50-57 mph, 
resulting in higher temperatures at speed.  

Likelyhood:  High

The only thing keeping me from throwing my 34-Pict-3 back on right
away is that it seems like there's a loss of power that's not associated
with the carb ( previously had more power with the same carb, previous engine)
and/or the fluctuating idle leads me to believe that I have other problems
to solve before i worry about the carb.

Hypothesis #2:

Fuel Pump not pushing enough fuel and the engine is running lean as a result.

Likelyhood: Medium

I don't think the fuel filter being "empty" while the engine is running is
really indicative of anything, but everytime I look at it, I wonder...
Is this indicative of anything?

Hypothesis #3:

I have a vacuum leak somewhere.

Likelyhood: Highest

I really figure the fluctuating idle means i have an idle leak
somewhere, but the only hose i haven't replaced (and which i should be
replacing this weekend) is the last 1' booster hose (between the metal
tubing and the brake booster itself).

Do I need the vacuum gauge to be directly connected to the manifold, in-line 
with the brake booster hose but before the check valve (as per schwarze in 
the archive)?  I thought that hooking it up inline with the dizzy vacuum
lines would at least give me some "first pass" information on what is
going on, but with readings under 5 cm3 of vacuum, either i have a 
huge leak or this isn't an effective test method.  The only other
place I can think of for a vacuum leak would be a carb bushing, or...???

*********************************************************************
Next Steps: ???

1) I guess my first step will be to try Raby (or was it Trembly) method
	of vacuum leak testing:  use a spray bottle filled with water and 
	see if the engine stumbles at any point.  Shouldn't i be concerned 
	about getting my plug wires wet (where they connect to the plug) by 
	doing this though?

2) connect vacuum gauge inline with brake booster hose and replace last
	bit of booster hose.  drive and observe readings with H30/31 Carb.

3) swap in spare fuel pump and see if it makes a difference in how much
	fuel i observe in the filter and/or engine temps

4) swap in spare 34-Pict-3 and see if it:
	- smooths my idle out
	- resolves power issues
	- gives any different readings on the vacuum gauge

5) ???

Any ideas on what i'm missing here folks?  I would like to believe that it's
just a vacuum leak that i have somewhere, but, if it is, it's doing a good
job of hiding and i'm at my wits end trying to find it.

thanks and sorry for the long post.  I just want to get my baby running
cool before i pull the engine to torque the heads.

cheers,
