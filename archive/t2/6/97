Subject: RE: [T2] Transport company to ship bus cross country?

I used http://www.DASautoshippers.com (Dependable Auto Shippers) to ship my
bus from Arizona to VA. It cost about $840 from their terminal in AZ to my
home in VA. I think their prices have gone up some since I shipped with them
which was around May. Check them out on the web and give them a call for a
price quote. I was very happy with their service. They estimated 14 days for
delivery and it only took 10. Bus was delivered unharmed. Their web tracking
did not work that well, but you can call and track it on an 800 number.
