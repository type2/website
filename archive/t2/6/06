To get an accurate vacuum reading, you ned to find a port that leads into
the manifold.  The port for the vacuum advance does not do this.  At idle,
your reading at that port is (or should be) near 0.  If it were not, you
would be getting vacuum advance at idle and you don't want that!  If you
have a vacuum retard port, use that one.  If you have an FI engine, the
port on the righ side of the air dist box (between #1 and #2 runners) is
excellent.   If you can plumb a port between the brake booster and the
check valve, as David reccomends, that is good.  The vacuum advance port
is no good, tho.
