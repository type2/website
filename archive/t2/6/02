Subject: Re: [T2] Replacing Wheels - photos ?

anyone that has Mercedes or Audi rims on their bus, 

I would like to have a photo to see what they look like on a VW,

also the size of the rim and any mounting problems,,,,

they made so many rims for Mercedes , I am sure some fit the wheelwell space 
and some do not.....

thanks for your help.....
