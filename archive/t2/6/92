Well, kind of.  The drag link is attached by tapered studs.  If you remove
the nuts, you will probably find that the studs are firmly stuck in the
swing lever and pitman arm.  This is how it should be, as you don't want
any play in these parts.

To remove these, you need some way to persuade the studs out.  _DON'T_
hammer on the studs!  Use a puller that presses the stud out or, in a
pinch, use a "pickle fork" tool that pulls the stud out.  The pickle fork
generally destroys the boots, but if you have a new drag link this usually
does not matter.

I have a Chevy pitman arm puller that, combined with homemade spacers,
works great for this.  VW had a special tool to do this as well.

Nope.

Yes, the same as the old one, as long as the front end is otherwise in
good shape.

Nil.  The swing lever doesn't wear.  However, the swing lever bushings in
the axle beam may be worn.  Have a friend get in the bus and turn the
wheel back and forth a quarter turn or so while you watch the swing lever.
Back and forth is what you want to see.  Up and down in verboten.  If you
get up-and-down motion, you need to replace the swing lever bushings.  On
a Bay, this is relatively easy.  Kits are available.
