Speaking of statistics...Anyone have 'em on the Vans when they actually were
new? MPG, repair records...etc. Be interesting to try and figure out what the
lifespan of various components was originally supposed to be and how far most
of us have gone beyond that figure. The engine life interests me most...I

think that "new" owners did much beyond what the warranty required - normal
service at the dealer? Present owners, by necessity, are much more involved
with their van's mechanicals...Were "new" owners? I wonder how many "new"
van engines survived their laissez faire owners?
Anyone know if something like Consumer Reports kept tabs on the vans when
they were still on the showroom floor?
