Subject: Re: [T2] Debugging an Engine that's running Hot

If fuel pump volume does not surpass consumption, it is almost the same
instance as having float height improperly adjusted.

I have seen multiple engines in the past year that would not respond to
jetting changes, they stayed lean all the time. When the fuel presssure was
tested, it was always low even below 1 psi on the gauge. After a fuel pump
change, the pressure came up, and the engine responded to changes and even
needed to be leaned out some..

Fuel pump quality is a huge concern, since a god pump is ahrd to find, we
now set all our engines up for an electric pump, that delievers no more
than3PSI. The only 2 warranty repairs I have made in 2 years were both
because of a mechanical pump, atleast if an electric pump goes bad, the
engine does not receive damage from a flood of fuel, into the crankcase...
