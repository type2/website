Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Rear Drum Removal!

On a 1978, as on my 1972 and any other one from 1971 and on, you don't have 
to take off the 36mm nut just to get the brake drum off to replace the shoes 
and cylinders.  There are two bolts, use an 11mm wrench, that you remove.  
These hold the drum to the hub.  If you have trouble removing the drum after 
these bolts are removed you will either have to back off on the adjusters or 
take care of the rust that is between the hub and drum.
