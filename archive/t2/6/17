Hey! All
This is my First post and i'm a newbie to VW 
I have a 76 Loaf with a siezed starter motor.
a new Bosch is $100. one from my FLAP is $60.
I can't shell out the scratch for the Good one, and i don't trust the cheap
one.
SO can my old 722 Bosch starter motor be rebuilted? and how difficult is the
process of rebiulting it?       Thanks   Gary VW
