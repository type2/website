Subject: [T2] Fuel Injection Running Rich

I am the proud owner of a '79 FI that requires emissions testing every (2)
years.  I just took it in and it of course failed for Hydrocarbons (HC).

The engine has been running rich for several weeks now (my doing).  I can't
seem to get it to idle without running it rich and advancing the timing.
I'm stumped, any ideas?

The injectors, cold start valve, flow meter, and temp sensor are all new.

Thanks - Mike
