Well, some swear by paraffin wax.  Apply some and heat the stud and head
to melt the wax and let it soak in.

Some swear by Kroil or PB Blaster.  Same deal.  These need time to work.

If you do the above and heat the head in the oven (350F or so) you will
probably be able to use vise grips to remove the stud.  Don't be
half-hearted when clamping the vise grips on the stud.  Get a good solid
grab that won't slip.

Generally, it's some combination of penetrant and thermal cycling that
will get these things loose

If you do snap the stud off, don't dispair.  Center-punch the stud and
drill down the middle with a 1/8 drill.  Enlarge the hole gradually with
larger bits and eventually you'll just barely get to the threads.  If you
were well-centered, the threads will come out a spiral!  If you were a bit
off, you can generally work the remaining threads around with a pin punch
to get them out.

If you really screw up, you can always tap the hole larger and use a
stepped stud.
