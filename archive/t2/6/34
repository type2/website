I did not know that ! I've been using a self-supporting starter on a Porsche 911
engine with a Porsche 228 flywheel for years.( What am i doing wrong ?! <:^)
Porsche 914 flywheel ring gear teeth are mounted 1/8 " closer to the transaxle,
and i have the same measurement with my combination of  911 / vw parts,
requiring a slight clearancing in the 76 vw manual trans for the flywheel to clear
the bellhousing, both on the o.d. circumference and at the four bolt casting places.
I am using a 76 911 Euro Carrera flywheel, and a 228mm feramic ( metal ) 6-puck clutch pack.
Perhaps the 2.0 vw flywheel is not working with the self-supporting starter for the opposite
clearance problem, being 1/8" further  back from engagement. Another good reason to
install the " improved" acnonvw engine.Or perhaps the 914 flywheel will make it work
in the 76 2.0 Bus. We need to go check the engagement distance of the two starters.
