Subject: Bus Non-Greetings.

I'm real sorry that the bus you passed the other day didn't wave back at
you. That's a real breach of bus etiquette, in my opinion. I have never had
it happen to me since in 4000 miles of daily driving and weekend trips
through four states, I'VE NEVER PASSED ANOTHER A/C VW OF ANY KIND! (Sorry,
was I shouting?) All I get is peace signs and shouts of 'shagmobile' from
adolescents riding in the back seats of new SUV's. I always respond with a
honk and a wave, just so I'll be in practice if I ever do see another bus on
the road.

Just venting,
Dave
