At 1st, I answered this question as ''Yes''.......but after running around to a
few yards today I have to say: It depends on the year. I had previously removed
the hinges from a 69, a 70, and a 77.....all were metal-to- paint. Today I
removed the hinges from a 72, a 73, and a 68. All BUT the 68 were
metal-to-paint. The 68 has a very thin vinyl liner on the bottom.
I found out another one-year-only difference. I already knew the 73's were
improved using flat stock steel like 74 and up, instead of aluminum tubular
guaranteed-to- bend stock. [sorry, the 74's I removed were junk so I left them].
The 2nd one-year-only difference is the 68's [besides the vinyl liners]. 69 to
72 has two carriage bolts going thru the roof and the hinge top is held on by
two nuts and lock washers. 68 is totally different: No carriage bolts thru the
roof, instead they use 3 phillips head screws on each one. They go UP thru the
top of the hinge and into 3 blocks of wood molded into the pop top.....
