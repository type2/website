Hmmmm... I'd say that the presence of a 1/2" square hole in the proper 
location militates against their being "designed for hammering":-), though 
I'm sure that some folks do it this way.

I'd also guess that the load is around half a million lbs per square in. Not 
"my" bearings :-) At the bery least, they will be flase Brinelled and fail 
very soon in service.

Good advice not to do it that way.
