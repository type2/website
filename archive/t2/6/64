Good Morning Folks,
      I just put some pictures of the nearly completed '77 up on my web
page. All I have left to do is install the sink cabinet, windshield, and new
canvas. I've read up on the canvas install, and I've already removed the old
canvas, but I would like to hear from others who've done their own canvas
replacement, any tips or tricks, what not to do, etc. I am also trying to
revive an old VW bus event, "Buses Near The Bay", at Point Lookout in
Southern Maryland. Check out the link at the bottom of my page. Thanks!
Jeff
