Indeed, the devices we discuss are typically half inch drive. This may work
for properly torqued axle nuts, but experience shows that at least one in
three will apply the principle of "If some is good, more is better, and too
much is just enough." When half inch drive tools are used with leverage
alone they will not get loose the inevitable 800+ lbft nut. 

These devices are in the form of a hammer wrench. They are designed for
applying leverage and releasing the torque with blows of a hammer. They are
legitimate tools called for in appropriate applications, VW axle nuts not
being one, three inch nuts on giant machinery mounts being one. The $10
variety are stamped from very heavy low spec steel and roughly broached.
The Hazet or SnapOn variety of real tool steel and ground to finish
dimensions with proper tolerances will probably run you $75 in the 46mm size. 

3/4 drive cross or breaker bar is the way to go, with pipe as leverage, and
a standard or impact socket. Even then, I sheared a 3/4" US top quality
steel bar once. I started with about a 6 foot purchase and bounced on the
end to no avail. Then extended to some 10 feet and with the help of an
accomplice just sheared off the tool. Took it to a tire shop with a 1"
drive impact setup. Took perhaps three iterations of 5 seconds operation,
then turned up the pressure to put a smerk if not a grin on the eagle's
face, and hit it again for 10 seconds to finally turn the nut. The threads
were neither rusty or stressed. Just incredible.

Frankly, servicing the brakes is a whole lot easier with the hub off. You
really can't clean things properly with it on there and just the drum off,
much less deal with the springs and shoes artfully.
