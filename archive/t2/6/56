If you can get it within the size limits (it's very close!), send it
Priority Mail rather than UPS. They tend to be much more gentle on
"dentable" objects like gas tanks.  We were shipping all of our Vanagon gas
tanks Priority Mail for that reason, until the post office caught on to the
fact that they were 6 inches over the size limit. :-(
