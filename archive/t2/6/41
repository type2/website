Subject: Stud removal

OK, just got a "new" head for the Monkbus, but the
exhaust studs are broken. I need to get them out. The
studs are broken 3/4 of the way up and I can only get
one nut on there, so the double nut method won't work.
(It worked so well on the ones that I removed from the
old head.) I have them soaking in penetrating oil right
now. I have tried vise grips to no avail.

Any suggestions as to removing them? Heat? I checked the
archives, but didn't find anything, believe it or not. 
(Maybe I still need to perfect my search technique.)

TIA
