I agree here, I have found a 15inch pipe wrench works very well, a good
one is on the order of $50 but you can fix a leak around the house too.

I have used pipe wrenches on the hub nut for 20+ years and along with the
appropriate breaker bar (I used to work in a hospital and have an old
orthopedic stainless traction frame bar that has served me well as a
breaker bar for 20+ years) doesn't mess up the nut nor will it slip. but
again don't try to use a piss ant little pipe wrench either.
