Subject: Westy at junk yard in Western North Carolina....

Saw it out of the side of my eye passing a junk yard.  They have two
busses.  One seems to be early 70's Westy with type 1 engine that is
pretty much all there.  The other is a transporter that has had the
engine picked and the interior too.  I took some pics in case anyone
wanted to try and get either of them.  The guy said he would sell the
Westy for $200.  There is easily that much in parts that you could get
off the bus.  They will probably get crushed in about a week or two
max.  Here is a link to the pics. http://65.217.40.27  There are some
other busses I took pics of too....the green one that is in good shape
is in the same area  (Black Mountain, NC).  Tried calling but never
called back.  Looking under it there seems to be new starter, fuel
filter, and exhaust.  One of the pics I took shows a severed line under
then engine.  I have no idea what it goes to though.  If needed, I can
get the the green Westy from the junk yard delivered to my house for
$300 if someone needs me to hold it for them.  I can only hold it for
one month max though.  Email me if you would like.
