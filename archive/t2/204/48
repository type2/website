Subject: RE: [T2] Storybook busses at auction

   The is a similar deal I know about in the Chicago area. A divorce sale.
Over 400 cars in the X's collection. Wife got control and by court order all
must go. Instead of an auction, she found a broker to get rid of them all.
Over 7 pre 67 VW bugs, 1 pre 63 bus and I didn't ask how many bays. This
does not count all the pre 70's chevy', ford's etc. He is cherging 10% of
any selling price. I am bidding on the VW lot

ronnie

all the cars are untoched, molested  in any way, all have titles and did run
when parked collection was started over 20 years ago, no wrecks etc. I was
told that all cars were purchased by the owner out of ads and auctions

Oly,

Sure would like to hear about it after the fact.

Looks like a *lot* of dust?...dirt on everything...which seems odd for
a "colectors" auction.

Don't forget the line at the bottom where you will add 5% payment to
the auctioneer for the "buyer's fee".  Hrumph.

Seems weird that the seller is not paying the auctioneer.

Cheers, dave
