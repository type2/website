Subject: Re: [T2] Injector seals

I don't know but my $20 set has lasted several years just fine. I got them 
from Advance Auto back when i would do business with them (when I worked 
there - before I came to conclusion that much of their parts are JUNK).

If all I had to do was change them once every 5 years or so then $20 is 
okay with me.

I suspect several brands of cars and vans used the same parts and the $6 
per version is in the name.
