I have been through two of these setups in the past. The big hidden 
drawback is the throttle cable tends to pull the carb forward. 
because of the angle of the cable. Since the carb is only supported 
by the manifolds the entire setup flexes forward a little bit. This 
causes a sensation of hesitation when you stomp the gas pedal. 
Additionally, the rubber boots connecting the manifold the the 
runners suffer a lot of motion that they were not designed for and 
ultimately crack and leak. The resulting vac leak is bad, bad and bad.

The best solution get something solid to connect the carb to the 
case. A good way to do this is to use the metal strips with holes in 
them that are used in stereo installation. Attach one end to the rear 
carb to manifold bolt and the other to a case bolt below the 
manifold. Reducing forward motion of the entire setup should put a 
stop to the above listed problems.
