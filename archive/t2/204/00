I would do which ever one placed the fan closest to the coils since moving the air over them is key.  I had a hole already cut into the side of my bus for a water fill spout.  Since I removed the water tank, I replaced this spout with a small louvered cover and I have one fan (about 2.5") on the inside mounted up against this vent blowing air outward.  After doing that, I decided that there still wasn't enough air circulating over the coils so I mounted another fan (about 3") horizontally at the top of the coils and roughly on par heightwise with the vent, blowing upward.  Not an ideal setup by any means but the best I could do without some serious custom ducting.  If I run the fridge with the fans off for a while, then switch them on I can go outside and feel hot air exiting from the vent.  Both fans together draw on the order of 200ma, as they are fairly small.  I don't think huge airflow is necessary and good thing because I don't want to spend another amp or more powering fans.  I've made a halfhearted effort to wire the fans in so that they will only run when the fridge is running, but haven't succeeded yet.  For now I just let the fans run all the time since they draw so little current.

I got mine at Camping World several years ago.  I just looked it up on their web site:

This is a different model than mine, and looks like a much better unit than mine - I may have to upgrade.  :)
