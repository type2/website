Should be 7.5mm. MB part # 916030 000527

Huh?  No way. I have no idea what he is trying to sell you.

For a FI bus? No, not enough. A meter is only 39 1/4" long. That is about what
you need to go from the tank to the filter alone. Then it depends if you have
steel tubing on each side of the cold start valve. If yes, then 2 meters
should do it. If no, then figure 3 meters. Do NOT use worm drive clamps,
i.e.Gates, they cut thru the hose! Use the original VW or MB clamps.
