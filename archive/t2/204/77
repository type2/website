Subject: F.S. 77 westy

well in order to help pay for college, i have to give up my westy so heres 
the stats on it. it's a 77 deluxe westy. has a rebuilt engine in her with a 
progressive setup on it. i have all the fuel injection parts for it though 
and the stock 2.0 out of it in long block form. the interior has wear on it 
and the canvas has a few rips but it's still presentable. the body is not 
rusty, no major rust under windsheild. only rust is some in battery box and 
in right rear corner. front end is solid and all suspension is good. it has 
new brakes all the way around including new calipers, pads, shoes, 
wheelcylinders, and mastercylinder. all electricals work and it has a new 
horn and turnsignal switch and flasher relay. all new gas hoses around with a 
new sending unit for the tank. tank was taken out and cleaned and sealed. has 
all the accessories still like the working stove, second battery, fridge, 
childs cot, and mosquito net. has a new battery, starter, and tires too. also 
has new 4 tip exhaust on the 77 heaterboxes. i'll take $1000 o.b.o. please 
help me give this bus a good home. thanks all.  you can email me for any 
other info. thanks again.
