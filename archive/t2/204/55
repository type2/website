Subject: Spray-in Bed Liners

Has anybody used a spray-in bed liner to cover the floor of their van? 
I'm considering having a product like Rino-Liner done on mine.  Just the
floor and filling up between the corrugations so it's a smooth surface. 
It seems to me that it would make a great base under the carpet and
would be durable enough to pull the carpet back set stuff on.

Thanks to Andy's link to the Cabela's Tent I found this (line wrap will
prob mess it up):

Any opinions?
