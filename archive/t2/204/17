David,
Piece of cake.  Mine broke Wednesday afternoon, 
luckily in the driveway, and I installed the new one 
Thursday morning before work.  I did a looksy of where 
it was run, then pulled out the old, pushed in the 
new.  There was still grease in the tube from the last 
cable, so I didn't add more.  It's easier than a 
clutch cable, that's for sure.

Not sure about how the cable is held on, since my 
original cable had a cutout section to 'hook' into the 
pedal bracket thingy.  I used a bolt, two flat 
washers, and two nuts w/ purple Loctite to hold my new 
one on.  Works fine, until I find out what the 
fastener is supposed to be.  I suspect it's the same 
type of clip as the clutch cable.

Good Luck!
