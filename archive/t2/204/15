Philosopy of Leswests
*	We like to enjoy the good things in life.
*	We are in favor of activities which don't cost much.
*	We prefer to camp outside of campings,even if it's not too legal.
*	We don't bother much about keeping our West's as neet or closer as
        possible to the original look of a Westfalias, we prefer the
        utility and the personnality of the vehicule.
*	We try to repair ourselves our Wests.
*	We try to help each other at the most.
*	We wanna have fun!
