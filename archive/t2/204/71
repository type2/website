Subject: Re: [T2] FRIDAY CAMPER QUESTION

The last time I passed out in my Riviera, my head was toward the hatch, but
I have passed out with my head towards the front and have even passed out
going side to side. I wonder if the different types of Beer I drank have
anything to do with it. Oh and I almost forgot abot the time I fell asleep
on top in the luggage area.......
