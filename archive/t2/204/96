Subject: pop top add on

I was asked about adding on a pop top to a hard top
transporter and suggested the individual look into
doing this instead..

It is generally accepted (per list threads over the
years) that if you cut the roof on a stock transporter
you weaken the bus structurally. This intuitively
makes
sense although I doubt anyone has actually tested it.
  The above doesnt give you the head room and or
sleeping access from the inside but it saves you from
hacking up a perfectly good roof... I would think, if
you did it right (right?) it would be $$$$ in time
and materials...
