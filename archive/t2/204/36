Subject: Tachometer help needed /pix


No replies so far.


Any thoughts on how to hook this tach up, or just to test and see if it 
works?

Never owned a tach before, and one was in the blank clock spot when
I got the bus, but never worked or was never connected.

There seem to be only two wires coming out of it, what do these hook
up to?
I would guess one to a ground and one to the coil maybe?

Here is a picture of the tach I have :
