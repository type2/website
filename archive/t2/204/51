Hi Everyone,
Well my bus made its first 500 mile trip last weekend and ran great!  Thanks 
to lots of help from this list.  But  in the morning on the first start it 
does not want to start or even idle it spins great just does not fire once I 
drive it about 15 feet it will idle great and start easy the rest of the 
morning.  It is an 80 westy and I live in northern VT  with lots of morning 
dew I was thinking of trying new plug wires and coil but was not sure if that 
was the right direction.  Oh yea it runs like crap in the rain if that helps. 
 New distubuter cap by PO last fall but he never drove it still looks like 
new.   Any body have any ideas?
Thanks and happy friday
Kevin
