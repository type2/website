Clark is having some difficulties posting to
T2.com so I forwarded for him.  

Could one of the admin's talk to him.  He seems
to have difficulting resubscribing with the
yahoomail.

Subject: [OVT] PLEASE POST TO THE TYPE2 LIST:
Weber manifold problem

Hey Ray/OHVbussers, 
I'm shooting for the Dixie gathering.  All i
need is the time to put the engine in and tweak
it a bit.  Fingers crossed!

I ask a favor.  Can someone who is a member of
the type2 list post this to that list and ask for
replies to be posted to that list(or this list)?
I can't  post to them from here as i am
prohibited from using freemail. 

Thanks. 

Just before bed the other night, i was
contemplating my Weber DFEV and its manifold -
the kind for the type4 conversion. It sits
rebuilt on my dresser awaiting installation. 

I noticed something - perhaps a new shortcoming
of this setup.  The carb functions such that the
primary throttle barrel does most of the work;
the secondary only begins to open at maybe a
little  under half throttle - maybe more, maybe
less. Anyway, the manifold is designed in such
away that the barrels  of the carb line up over
the manifold ports that connect to the runners
that go to either cylinders 1&3 or 2&4.

If the carb sits so that you're looking at the
main idle screw when you look into the engine
compartment (normal position), then the primary
throttle body sits in line with (over) the ports
for 2&4. 

Now, i know all four cylinders should pull the
mixture at the same rate, but if the mixture
exits the carb directly over the ports for #2&4
(a couple inches away from the ports for #1&3), i
figure one of  two things may be happening: 
> 1. #s 2&4 are running rich 
> 2. #s 1&3 are running lean until the secondary
> opens.
