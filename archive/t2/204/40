Subject: Buses in Movies

I think I saw a bus get totaled in Charlies Angeles. I remember 
remarking on what a horrible thing to do to a perfectly good bay window. 
Seems like a car goes right through it from the side.

Maybe I'll go see if I can scare up the DVD here at work and a portable 
DVD player and take a looksee. Who wants to work on a Friday anyways!

P.s. I work for a DVD manufacturer in case anyone is wondering why I 
have access to lots of DVD's and all kinds of DVD players.
