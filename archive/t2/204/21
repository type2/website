Subject: more Fri. fun - bus sightings in movies

last weekend i saw 2 movies that both featured cameo appearances
by bay window busses, both of the 68-72 variety.

"Vanilla Sky"
"Spy Game"

only a freak like me (& yourself if you are reading this) would
notice of course.

have a great weekend everyone,
