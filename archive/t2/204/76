Subject: Re: [T2]  HARD MORNING STARTING?

You are describing a moisture problem.  Either the distributor is not 
sealed  up right, or a bad cap.  I would start with the cap, making sure 
that  is was the correct one at the same time.  the center  contact in 
the cap to the rotor often will not make  good contact  in a  cap that 
is close but not correct.  This  happens  a  lot when distributors get 
switched in older vehicles and the new  cap actually is  for a dizzy 
that is almost the same.  Also will happen with the rotor.  Moisture 
will magnify these problems.  moisture will  also find hairline  
invisible  cracks and  cause serious missfiring or  no  start untill  a  
few hot spins.  The problem you describe  is not usually a single wire 
or  the coil  unless  it  is the coil wire  to the dizzy  arching out.
