Subject: Inspection Passed

Yippee!  I passed my Virginia safety inspection.

If anyone ever wants to know about the differences between the older and
newer front disk brakes, let me know, I have become very familiar from
having to sort out all my problems.

Thanks to the list for helpful tip.

Bob,
'72 blue/white 7 seater
totally original, except for '73+ front brakes.
