Mike,

The exhaust system might be part of it.

Something else I thought of was the flywheel and clutch assembly.  A big
thing for the racers is to cut down the flywheels to reduce rotating
weight.  You'll see adverts for 11 lbs or 12 lbs flywheels in the Bug
racer supplies.  That allows them to rev all the faster with reduced
momentum to overcome.  The bus assembly I'll bet is a lot heavier than
the 914 Flywheel and clutch. 

Just an idea.
