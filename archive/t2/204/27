Subject: re: bus sightings

I recently saw a mexican movie called Y Tu Mama Tambien that had
quite a few vws.  Nice movie.

I also recently read two books which feature busses.

In American Gods by Neil Gaiman the characters spend the last section
of the book traveling around in a 1970 bus.

In Been Down So Long it Looks like Up to Me by Richard Farina there is
a microbus full of weird characters.  I believe that at one point the
weirdos whip the bus.  The sixties sure were weird.
