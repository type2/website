I could not help but notice on my vacation a couple of weeks ago, the =
large amount of busses on the Washington/Oregon coast. We must have seen =
over 50 in a week! These were not the same ones over and over.  I even =
spotted  a dual cab!  I have decided that busses are much like birds, =
migratory.  There are hardly any around Spokane, WA. Pretty sad really.
