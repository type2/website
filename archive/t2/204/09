Subject: Dixie Bus Gathering

Hello All,

Just a reminder that Dixie Bus Gathering in Central Ohio is fast
approaching.  We have had over 250 people visit the web site.

I encourage you to check back next week, as I will have it updated.  I will
list what you should bring with you, T-Shirt ordering etc.

Here's a snippet of what you can expect:

Swimming, world famous air cooled chili, FMBC breakfast burrito, a very
large Vintage Volkswagen show (enter yours) {over 350 vw's last year}

email me off list with any questions.

I will be requesting an attendance report.  It is necessary that I know how
many think they will be attending, due to the fact that I am planning on
feeding everyone Saturday evening.  NO CHARGE

Dates are August 9-11.
