Same solid lifter cam. 914 1.7 was D-jet FI

This is not a compression ratio, it is a compression test.

The smaller combustion chamber of the 1.7 heads
increased the compression ratio. This is the power secret.
Vacuum increased from the smaller valves,
it gives that low end  torque increase,
but wimps out at the top end.
