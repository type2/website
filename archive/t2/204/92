Hi Mark,

    Because your crankshaft pulley has no timing mark, he was talking =
pulling the engine and using the flywheel stop method to find TDC. I =
would use valve overlap as a reference to the intake and exhaust valves =
overlapping (passing, or reaching the same height as one another, as one =
opens and the other closes). This is a way to find TDC with out tearing =
down the engine (as long as the cam timing is set on "O" no advance or =
retard, it will be on your stock engine).
    So it goes like this: Pull both valve covers.......adjust =
valves...........roll the engine over by hand watching the valve action =
on number 3 cylinder........when the intake and exhaust valves on #3 are =
just crossing (overlap) each other..........number 1 cylinder is at =
TDC.............at the top of the pulley just opposite the split of the =
case take the corner of a file and make a "Vee" cut in the lip of the =
pulley. This is your TDC mark. You have an "advance" timing light you =
say, your base timing should be 7.5' BTC, you can cheat a little and go =
up 10' BTC, but I wouldn't go any higher. You still live in Lafayette =
right, in our hot Louisiana summers if you get any "Ping" at all, back =
it up to the 7.5' BTC!
    BTW, if you make a paint mark 180' across the pulley from the first =
it will help you when your adjusting the valves.
    If you have the engine out, there is nothing wrong with the flywheel =
stop method, but the is the quickest way.
    Let me know how it comes out.
