Subject: Re: [T2] Spray-in Bed Liners

The bed liner is another option that i used on one bug.  I bought one of 
the rubber truck bed liners from the flaps and cut it do what i needed.  
I think they run about 45 dollars.  This is a very heavy thick rubber.  
On the bug it made an exceptional sound deadner.  Note the heavy when 
you try to pick up a box for even a small midget truck.
