Subject: Re: [T2] more Fri. fun - bus sightings in movies

Joel,

Maybe this has been covered before and maybe not:  We all know that in the
first "Back to the Future" the bad guys at the mall were driving a Bay with
a nice big sunroof, but in the end, when the doctor does the
hover-conversion, and says "roads, where we're going we don't need roads"
there is a white Bay parked on the left.

When the movie people reshot that scene, same words, different time, for the
sequal, the VW was replaced by a white Ford van, of late 60s, early 70s
vintage.

Have a great weekend everyone.
