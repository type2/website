Subject: Re: Best movies and TV shows for bus sightings:


Being an old movie/TV show lover, I agree about the Steve McQueen movie
"Bullit", and for TV sightings you can't beat "Chips". Just saw one the
other night where two kids were in a split beater that "Barfed the engine".
Love that show, it just kills me when they are in a high speed chase of the
bad guy on the interstate, (at like twenty MPH)
