Jan,

I'm curious why you wouldn't fill in the floor.  That was one of my
primary intentions to avoid the use of plywood or something that might
get wet a rot.  I would think the Rhino-liner would seal and protect the
floor and give some cushion.

Chris,

I just went through the whole floor area center part of the van and
welded closed all of the holes put there by PO's and wire brushed and
rust converted any rust. Actually there was very little even surface
rust.  I get the idea that part of the installation process for
Rhino-lining is to have the area sand blasted first.  Does anyone know
for sure?
