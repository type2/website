Christopher-

I'm not an expert, but I'd suggest you go to the
Stewart Warner web site - http://www.stewartwarner.com
check the tech/faq section and ping the tech email/phone POC info.

By the way it *looks*, my guess would be the
white = ground
black = coil signal
plug in middle = light bulb source

Never heard anything on SW's tech ... no way could
they be as good as Autometer, and I'm sure this list
will say VDO or bust ... YMMV.

Good luck, Aloha,
