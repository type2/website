Oly,

Sure would like to hear about it after the fact.

Looks like a *lot* of dust?...dirt on everything...which seems odd for
a "colectors" auction.

Don't forget the line at the bottom where you will add 5% payment to
the auctioneer for the "buyer's fee".  Hrumph.

Seems weird that the seller is not paying the auctioneer.

Cheers, dave
