Subject: the kombi import question has surfaced in another group again

Visit this area and tell me how your going to get that kombi into the 
US.  or Canada as their transport rules are not that different.
Remember that a Kombi was  never typed in the US as production/importing 
stopped on that style of buses before compliance with certain rules had 
to be done.  The vanagon is a much different vehicle.  The primary 
differences over the years on the vanagon very closely reflect 
adjustment to the phase in dates for certain epa and ntsb requirements.  
Same for many manufacturers of that time.  As well as phasing in of new 
euro rules.
