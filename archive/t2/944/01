Subject: Bus Sub ready to install photos

Here are pictures of my finished sub, taken in my cubicle, but ready to install.

This is the old picture to show what it looked like installed but before gluing, painting, assembling http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r112/Rodewarrior/Bus%20Speakers/P1010011.jpg

This is it with the grill on against the wall so the drivers can't be seen, this is similar to how it will look installed http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r112/Rodewarrior/Bus%20Speakers/P1010039.jpg

Turned around so you can see the drivers, this side will be against the back of the seat, with cheap imitation Dynamat http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r112/Rodewarrior/Bus%20Speakers/P1010041.jpg

And with the grill removed http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r112/Rodewarrior/Bus%20Speakers/P1010042.jpg

I am getting pretty excited about this, I ordered the dual battery harness from the German Supply, I am going amp shopping on Friday, and I hope to make some progress on the front box this week, I still have never touched the cardboard version that is hanging by masking tape after 3 days, my boss rode in my bus this morning and she thinks her purse may have touched it when she was getting in once, I think she might be making fun of me http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r112/Rodewarrior/Bus%20Speakers/P1010027.jpg
