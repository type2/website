Subject: Re: [T2] Only idles with choke fully closed

I got one of these (solex 34pict3) carbs from those folks and I have
exactly the same problem with it. Runs, idles nice, choke opens and it
dies. I wasn't too happy with the media blasting either, but only
because it looks like all the jets were blasted too. Even with a good
set of jets swapped in, it still won't idle warm. I'm sure other have
had results that will vary.

In my case swapping on another carb fixes the problem. That would
eliminate many other potential causes (vacuum leak, etc). If you've
got another carb give that a shot.

If you do figure out the issue be sure to let us know.
