Subject: southwind gas heater

hey guys and gals, i have a stewart warner southwind gas heater for a bus
model #8332b-12V.
I have run the gas line with a filter in it and i have had it running for
only a few seconds ,
 but it backfires and then theres no fire..i have resoldered the condenser
for better contact,
but it has not helped...any ideas? also after it backfires i smell raw
gas...thanks joe
