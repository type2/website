Subject: Gear Shifting Problems

Hello There,

I have a 1976 2.0L Manual Type 2 Camper.  

I was driving home from work yesterday and realized it was difficult to shift into 1st and 2nd gear.  When I shifted into third gear, it wanted to grind unless I moved the shifter real slow.  4th gear had no problem.  This morning I was warming the bus up and now I can not shift into 1st or 2nd gear at all. When the engine is off, I can engage the gears no problem, but when the engine is on, no go.  My clutch cable doesn't have too much play or too little play so I don't think that is the problem.  

I am new at troubleshooting VW's and would be grateful if anyone could point me in the right direction.  

Thanks,
Matthew

p.s. I have searched the archives and have only run across tranny problems associated popping out of gear.  My problem is getting into gear, so I thought I would send this out in hopes of some advice:-)
