Yep, Karl's one or two used ones.  I was by his place last weekend and
spotted them in a box of other parts.  That is if he hasn't moved them from
the spot we were both looking at <grin>.

New ones have gone the way of the Dodo Bird.  Bosch discontinued it early
last year.  I'm keeping my eyes peeled for good used ones these days.

Python Fuel Injection rebuilds them.  Check their site for the closest
supplier of their product(s).
