Subject: Re: [T2] J-type thermocouples

Mike - Very good 'splanation, thank you. Do you know
what the voltage ranges are vs the ideal heat ranges
of the various types of thermocouples. In other words,
it is my understanding that J-type and K-type have
different heat ranges - Am I correct in this?

Also - I understand that the voltage induced is
different for different thermocouples - is this
correct?

And here's the bottom line: What is the correlation
between "X" Volts and say, 500 degrees? (and is it
linear - is 250 degrees F one-half the voltage of 500
deg F?)

Understanding that the conditions are almost
infinitely variable, but in a controlled environment
of a specified connector-end temp of say, 0 degrees C
so that calculations from there can be easily made.
