Jon,

I have had to do this on an engine I built many years ago.

I made a template from a block of aluminum and very carefully adjusted
the drill stop so this I didn't drill too deep.

It has worked well for years.  The main concern is drilling and taping 
"straight"  so that you don't get into the oil chamber.


Cheers, dave
