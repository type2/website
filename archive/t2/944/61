Subject: Re: Stalling in cold weather

You have described the dreaded "progressive carb icing" to a tee! The 
problem is that the very long manifolds take for ever to fully warm 
up at idle so as soon as you start driving all that nice cool air 
coming in causes the fuel to condense on the inside of the manifolds 
and the engine to stall at idle. Without engine modifications the 
only way I have found to cope with this is driving for long enough 
for the manifolds to warm through. Can be a bit tricky to say the 
least! If you go through the archives you will find numerous 
modifications to deal with this situation. The simpler ones are 
bolting on a non-VW air cleaner to suck in warm air from the right 
head as in the stock arrangement and bolting a electric heater to the 
carb base. You should also have the stock thermostat to bring the 
engine temp to operating level ASAP.

Cheers,

Martin.
