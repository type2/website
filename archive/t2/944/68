It's an inverse bell curve...Most cars follow it. Prices drop as the
car depreciates (and ages) 'til it hits that point of not being "old"
but "collectible"; then the prices rise as it gets more and more
"antiquey"... ;-)
BTW, most amateur collectors end up with the cars they would
have bought (if they had the money then) or actually had when
they were 18-24 years old...Serious collectors (like Jay Leno)
just buy eveything else...;-)
