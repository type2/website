Subject: Rebuild cabinet

I'm working on a rebuild cabinet. Basically, it's a cabinet that holds 
every piece of an engine rebuild so that it can all be viewed at once. 
By design, it will be similar to the Studley tool cabinet:

So, in similar form, the rebuild cabinet will have two racks, one left 
and one right, for four push rods and four push rod tubes. The purpose 
of the cabinet is to provide safe storage for all of the pieces of a 
rebuild once they are cleaned, and allow for a quick visual inventory 
of progress.

With luck, I'm picking up an engine tomorrow and beginning a total 
rebuild. Someday I'll find the right rest-of-the-bus.
