Subject: CHT  -  again

	Whether one goes for a single reading point, as in the std 
VDO CHT, or 2 reading points using a simple switch between two 
thermocouples to read on just the one gauge at will, or the full quad 
gauge with 4 reading points, the question remains where to put the 
k-thermocouple(s).
	The std answer for aero engines is, substituting for 
spark-plug washer(s).  It is pretty clear  however from comments & 
pix by those who've done it on T2 engines that this is difficult to 
reconcile with ordinary removals & replacements of spark plugs.
	If other places on the cyl head(s) are to be used for the 
thermocouple(s), it is then pointed out that the figures showing on 
the gauge(s) will differ significantly from those that would have 
been read from that position clamped to the head under a spark plug. 
But then, it has been insisted all along that what matters with these 
figures is their trends, not their absolute values.
	A thermocouple (or other T-sensor) in firm contact with a cyl 
head will read something near the actual T of that cyl head, if 
covered with a suitable thermal insulator.  A trap one can see in 
this idea is that passage of cooling air past that part of the head 
might be impeded by this stuck-on rig, which could cause serious 
trouble.
	I've found a local agent for the quad gauge, and am 
contemplating buying his 4-thermocouple rig.  Can anyone suggest 
where the thermocouples could be stuck on the heads where they would 
be no nuisance while covered with thermal insulation?  And what 
insulation material would seem good?
