Paul,

Sorry, no pics, but basically as Mark told me, folded in half and shoved
down in between the two fins closest and over where the spark plug sits.

The actual "sensor" or junction is where the wires are held by a crimp in 
the metal of the ring.  So if it's a 14mm spark plug, the sensor is about 
7-8mm above the actual cast surface of the head and is hard up against a 
fin.

I debated with myself about drilling a hole in the fin and bolting it on, 
but it seemed to fit tightly enough to not worry about it, besides, where 
is it going to go!



Cheers, dave

  Do you have a picture of this?  I've never really liked the sparkplug
  location, but I haven't seen anything else, really.  Not having a CHT
  at all, I'm in no place for judgments, but I was just curious about how
  the folded sensor was secured, how deep down against the head you put
  it, does the fold interupt the sensor's abilities, you know that kinda
  stuff.
