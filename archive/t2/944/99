hehehe.. my friends were making fun of me because I recently decided not 
to move to the colder mid-west because I didn't want to have my bus be 
in an environment where they used salt and it would damage my body.

My boss made a joke as if I were married:

imaginary wife: "Mike, why don't we move to ......"
me: "I'm sorry honey, I just don't think that would be ok for the bus."

hahahahaha
