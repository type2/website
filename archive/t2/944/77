Subject: TGIF: 35 years and 80,000 kilometres!

Hi Volks!

Just a quick note to say that today, Friday, January 12, 2007,
is a double cause for celebration: my panel van "Uncle Gerbelmann"
turned 35 today, and its odometer turned 80,000.  Kilometres,
of course, since we're both in Germany.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
