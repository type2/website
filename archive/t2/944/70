Then - I think the price of the car is at it highest when the 'collectors' 
are between the ages of .... say 45 and 65 ... and many of those people are 
buying cars that were around when they were kids .. I think ... buses will 
go up and up in price .. until they reach a plateau and then prices will 
either drop or level off and not keep up with inflation.

I guess that's no great revelation.
