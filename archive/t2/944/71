Subject: VERY cold weather starting

Wow. Had my first sub-zero morning start with the Guac today.

Ouch.

Took several tries to even get the solenoid to kick the gear onto the
flywheel. And then it sounded horrible as it turned the engine.
Clunking and slow turning. Bad.

Once it warmed up it was fine, but it was a nervous few seconds before
I got it going. I'm glad we rarely get temps this low.

I see why folks use block heaters now...
