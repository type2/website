When I shifted into third gear, it wanted to grind unless I moved the shifter real slow.  4th gear had no problem.  This morning I was warming the bus up and now I can not shift into 1st or 2nd gear at all. When the engine is off, I can engage the gears no problem, but when the engine is on, no go.  My clutch cable doesn't have too much play or too little play so I don't think that is the problem.
