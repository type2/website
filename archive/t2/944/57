Subject: Stalling in cold weather

Hello All

I live in Northern Colorado and have a recently purchased a rebuilt 2.0 L
'76 Westy with a single Weber Carb.  I am new to cold weather climates (grew
up in South Florida) and our temps lately have been in the 20's and 30's.

I have two questions, advice or help on either one would be much
appreciated.

Here is my 1st situation....
-My bus starts fine (even in below 0 temps), warms up in a few minutes, and
idles really well once warmed up.
-Once I start driving to work, my bus wants to stall every time I come to a
stop (even after driving for 30 minutes).  She will stall when I finish
downshifting or when I just brake to a stop.  To prevent her from stalling I
have been doing the -brake with left foot / rev engine with right foot- when
I come to a stop.  She only needs a few revs and then she idles really well
again.  If the temperature is above 50 or so, this whole problem does not
occur, the bus idles just fine when I come to a stop.  I am assuming this
has something to do with the temp outside.

My question is...Why does the bus stall when coming to a stop even though
the engine is completely warmed up?  Is it the choke? Should I adjust it or
unhook it as Muir suggests?


Here is my 2nd situation....
-I have a VOD head temp gauge, which for the past three months has been
reading 350 F when cruising between 55-60mph
-Within the last few weeks the gauge has been reading 400 F when cruising at
those same speeds, on the same roads.  The only thing that is different is
the temperature outside.  My oil temp never goes above 180 F.

My question is...Why would the heads be running hotter all of a sudden?

Any help or suggestions with either of these questions would be much
appreciated.

Thanks,
