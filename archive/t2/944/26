Subject: Re: [VB] Alternator with 34 pict 3

You can cleanance the alternator for the accel pump bellcrank with careful
grinding. The other method is usually bending the bracket, which I do not
like. I would not insulate the carb from the maniolfd as it invites further
icing with only the normal preheat to defend it instead of preheat and
manifold heat, but keeping in concept that manifold heat is mostly for below
the carb, that might be a solution also.

There is a factory alternator 34pict3 carb version for the alt equipped
beetles for 73-74 which has different beelcrank to clear the alternator...if
you can find one.
