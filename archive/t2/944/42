Subject: Slightly OT - B-2 gas heater not shutting off fan after turned

My B-2 gas heater in my 70 bug shuts down the heat and usually runs the fan for about 2 minutes afterward to get rid of residual heat. Lately however the fan has not shut off, and keeps on running unless I give the square sheetmetal box on top of the actual heater a sharp rap with my hand. I suspect there are points in there sticking under the sheetmetal box? Could anyone point me in the right direction to fix this, as it's annoying to have to give it a rap to stop the fan. It has just started doing this in the last week, twice so far. Complete idiot guide would be nice with directions on how to stop this. Can I just clean up the points etc?? if it is indeed points?
Many thanks in advance,
Courtney
