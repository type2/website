Go look at my photo albums and you'll see an ideal
solution to the problem you're facing. The most
instantaneous readings will come from under the
sparkplugs as this is the most direct path to the
combustion chambers. BTW- Aircraft Spruce has the 48"
stainless-wrapped leads that allow you to place the
connections on top of the tranny - a place protected
some from engine temp and well protected from road and
wind temp.
