Subject: Splittie profiteering

A buddy of mine sent 2 pix which I can't show youse on T2.  Here's 
his accompanying note:

The last few days I've been in Lost Wages chasing business at the 
Consumer Electronics Show (CES).  Taking a breather, we went to what 
used to be a car museum at one of the casinos.  It turns out that it 
has been converted into a primo car sales lot and is still quite 
interesting for all the quality restorations therein.  Attached is 
one that goes for US$26,000 if you have some money burning a hole in 
your pocket.

	======

	The vehicle is a shiny bus ca.1965 with chrome VW emblem on 
front and about 17 windows but no 'skylight' tourist windows.


	My reply to him was:

   This splittie would need to have a top rebuilt motor & trans, and 
everything else fine, to be worth more than $10k, wouldn't it?   My 
guess is that the owner doesn't really want to sell it but figures 
that if a silly enough fool comes along who has just struck a 
jackpot, what the hell.
