Take a look at the wikipedia page on thermocouples:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermocouple

It's pretty complete.  The voltage to temperature correlation is
non-linear.  Type J thermocouples have a range of -40 to 750 C.

This web site has tables relating the temperature difference to output
in mV of various thermocouple types:

For the typical CHT temperature difference of around 300F, you get an
output of about 8 mV from a Type J thermocouple.
