Looks good!
I have some Infinity speakers in the kick panels and have noticed sometimes 
you
don't hear them equally at low levels (they do allow you to point the 
tweeters at
different angles). I also have some 6.5" Infinity's under the back seat, a
14" Pheonix Gold Sub hidden in the rear closet and 2 amplifiers under the 
rear seat
as well. Everything is pretty hidden which I like. I have an awesome Kenwood 
MP3
Excelon deck running the whole thing.

I really like being able to remove the sub in 30 seconds when we go on a 
long
trip where all the packing space is needed. The other speakers still provide 
decent
bass when cruising. Im super picky about the quality over the loudness 
however
I do have the benefit of both if some annoying Honda pulls up beside me 
thinking
his stereo and crappy music are what everyone else wants to hear.

Here are pictures of my finished sub, taken in my cubicle, but ready to 
install.
