I have the Henrob or Cobra as its called and it's a nice little deal. I got
mine from Fournier Enterprises, there's a link toward the bottom of my home
page. Skill is a big factor in using it. I use it for Brazing and straight
welding, Its great for heating and shrinking as you can concentrate on a
smaller area at one time.  Its slow but the welds and easier work after
welding. I wouldn't really recommend it for a novice as it isn't cheap. I
have a friend who uses it for cast and aluminum, he loves it.  I like mine a
lot but I still depend on the 110volt migs more than anything. Later
