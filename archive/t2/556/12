LOL...

Hi Mike

But I would rather say I'm going to comb the baby's hair differently after
the bath ;)
I have studied the megasquirt system and it will be the controller for me
too!
I would also say if your not use to using a hot soldering iron, the
megasquirt system could be intimidating being it's a kit, but in my life
time I have used well over 30 lbs of solder putting stuff together sparingly
on the solder joints.
I have been eyeing some replacement FI throttle body's to replace the Webers
and with the megasquirt, I know I could tune it to get better then 13 mpg,
even with the cam I'm running and more HP  :)

Doug...

Throw the baby out and replace it with megasquirt!

I just did a 1000 mile trip and tuned my FI the whole trip through my 
laptop.. it was great.  More than you could EVER do with the L-Jet, or 
carbs, for that matter.
