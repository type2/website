Subject: Fuel Pressure Gauge 

I received this hint from a listee vai P-Mail.  I wish I could remember who 
it was.

Hint:  Use a water pressure gauge from Sears at $7 vice a fuel pressure 
gauge from anywhere at $30+.

The water pressure gauge goes to 100 psi instead of the optimal 60 psi, but 
it is adequate to measure the FI fuel pressure.

It is available in most hardware where the sump pumps are sold.  Sears and 
Home Depot had the same gauge, but Sears was cheaper, much cheaper.

Also, the H2O pressure gauge comes in both a 1/4" and a 1/8" nipple so you 
only need a piece of FI hose to go from the H2O gauge to the fuel rail.  And 
two FI clamps, if the guy reading the fuel pressure is a nervous type!!

Thanks for reading so far.  Most people just blow away any messages coming 
from 'Sage Green'.  I know that I do....
