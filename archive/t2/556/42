To simply remove the distributor you loosen the 13mm nut that holds the
clamp onto the case and pull up the distributor.  If you don't loosen the
clamp around the distributor itself and don't disturb the motor (i.e., spin
the crank) then you can just put the right distributor back in place and
it'll be timed exactly the way it was before.  There's no need to set it to
some "special" place beforehand because the distributor drive dog will only
line up one way.

If you know that you'll be spinning the crank after the distributor is
removed, then it's convenient to turn the motor over until the rotor is
pointing at the #1 "notch" on the edge of the distributor.  Then, when you
install the distributor, turn the engine over until #1 is at TDC of the
compression stroke, line the rotor up with the #1 notch on the edge of the
distributor, and slide the distributor back in place.  Again, if you don't
loosen the clamp around the distributor the timing should not be affected.

If you *do* loosen the distributor clamp then you *will* affect the timing.
In that case you get #1 cylinder at TDC of the compression stroke, slide the
distributor back into place, rotate the distributor until the rotor is
pointing at the #1 notch, and tighten everything down.  Then, after the
engine is running and warmed up you'll need to re-time the engine.
