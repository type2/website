Here is a grate web page on a vanagon /TDI upgrade ;)

http://www.haywood-sullivan.com/vanagon/TDI/

Last year at RMMW show there was a bay with a diesel in it, with two custom
radiators under the bus, no ugly radiator up front! , said he was getting
about 30 mpg on the rood, sorry no picks of that one.

I know you're all tired of hearing my young and therefore foolish ideas of
putting a diesel into my '78 however I'm sticking to the idea and was
wondering if anyone had photos of the engine compartment of a diesel vanagon
and/or someone who lived in either the NY or OH area that would exchange a
beer for a chance for me to take a look at their diesel.

Thanks,

Giles
