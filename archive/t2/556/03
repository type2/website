Regardless of "is this the one", sure would have been nice if the page 
had the correct model year for that Bus.  They list it as a '71, but it 
looks more like a '73 (front turn-signals, "ear vents", rear taillights 
all look like a '73-'79, but there appears to be a door over the fuel 
filler -- not sure if that was a '73 feature or not).
