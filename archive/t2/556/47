Subject: RE: [T2] Bus Price ??? What do you think

Check it out thoroughly or have it checked out.

Find out who did the rebuilds, bodywork, and paint. Check those people
out.

$3000 is not too much to pay for a bus. Just make sure that you're
getting a bus that's worth $3000.

I am looking at a stock 1971 bus, in Good condition. Advertised as
having
rebuilt engine & tranny, Clean body, new paint. And they are dead set on
getting $3,000 for it. This is a California bus, and looks to be in
Good/Great condition.
So, Is this a 'good' price for this bus, or am I thinking of putting too
much out?

Thanks,
Matt
