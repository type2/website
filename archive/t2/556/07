This is something I noticed when I went from my stock distributor to an 
ACN SVDA.  Basically, the difference is the direction that the vacuum 
can is assumed to point (well, not on the 009, obviously :-)  On a Type 
1 engine, it points "down and to the left", and on a Type 4 engine, it 
points "up and to the right".

Orient the bodies of your two distributors so that the points are "up" 
and distributor drive keys are facing the same direction.  Now, feel 
around the rim of the distributor body for a small notch.  On your 009 
it is probably "up and to the left", whereas on the 205 is is probably 
"down and to the right".  That is #1 notch, but on your 009 installed 
in a Type 4 engine, it actually points to #3 (or, it should, unless 
you've turned the 009 180deg after engaging it with the distributor 
drive :-)

All you need to remember is:

	- Vacuum can points to the right (passenger side)

	- Plug wires are: 3 2   passenger side ->
	                  4 1
	                    rear (RIR)

and you should be golden.  If you install your 205 this way, the points 
should be oriented the same way our 009's points were oriented, and the 
small notch should be where the #1 plug wire should go.  This is 
because all of those Bosch distributor bodies are essentially 
compatible, but the notch was placed differently depending on what 
engine the distributor was intended for.

(This is what I have surmised, anyhow... if anyone has different 
information, by all means, please correct me.)
