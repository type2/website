The new system of VIN numbers was introduced in 1980
with the Vanagon. So all the Baywindow buses have
either the 9-digit VIN (1968-1969 models) or the
10-digit VIN (1970-1979 models)

If that VIN is correct than you have a 1976 bus
instead of a 1972:

22 = model:  VW microbus
6 = modelyear: 1976
2093801 = serial number

If you want to know more about your car you can check
out the M-plate. It is a metal plate with codes fixed
on the metal wall behind the drivers seat. I made a
site about it with the explanation:
