Not necessarily.

If you're getting a different fuel pressure than is expected, it can 
effect the way your engine runs.  It can also be a fire hazard if 
improperly installed, etc.

Again, not necessarily.

It could just be that electric fuel pumps are cheaper to make.  Or that 
electric fuel pumps are easily swappable between different makes 
and models, so it's become more of an industry standard.  Etc.

New doesn't equal better.

of my '67 this weekend.  With any luck I'll have the tranny back in and
