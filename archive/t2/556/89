While both pumps will do the job. A mechanical pump
wont overheat and die if the fuel filter clogs.
Electric
pumps depend on fuel flow for cooling.
  Its kind of funny.. if you have/work on newer cars..
vee dubs included and you read a post about $130 being
pricey for a fuel pump.. you just have to chuckle.
  try putting new brake pads on a Jetta or Volvo or
any other "newer" car for that matter.. if you want
sticker shock!
  not getting into the fray here.. just an
observation.
