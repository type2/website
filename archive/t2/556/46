Subject: Bus Parts For Sale At Yard Sale Tomorrow

If any of you happen to live in or near Hesperia California I'll be having a
moving sale May 14th - 17th and I've got quite a few misc. Bus & Beetle parts
that I'll be selling.  I'm very busy getting ready for the sale and probably
won't be on the computer much the next few days but if you are interested the
sale is located on Mesquite St. between 3rd & 5th, in Hesperia.  Look for the
signs.
John
