Hi Paul,

According to Buskatier Mike Hanson:  "Its in albuquerque with Myron 
Hill of kubelkar fame... He was going to give it back to me and I was 
going to pass it on to Andy Wand, but he neglected to bring it the last 
time we all met up. I'll keep you posted."

There is a tentative plan that will see it travel to Alaska in the next 
few weeks.


Happy trails,
