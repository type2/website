Having been once of the first to ever order parts from Ron (Remember the CV 
Boot / Grease / Bolt / Washer kits he put together for $10? Man, those were 
the days...)

Anyway, inquiring minds want to know what part you could install that 
wouldn't be obvious when you were installing it, but would damage the bus 
that much? (Part of my interest is prurient morbidity, but part is also to 
be forwarned myself, as I have been known to wrench on the bus early in the 
morning and late at night when the brain is not operating as fast as the 
hands...)
