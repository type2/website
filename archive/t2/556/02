Subject: RE: [T2] 1700 Dual Carbs - same as another or different??????

Just looking at the carbs on mine I'd say they're specific left-right.

The reason is the idle sync. The left carb has all the adjustments for idle. 
The right one just has a volume adjustment (and flap adjustments that all 
carbs have).

Are the dual carbs on a 1700 engine interchangeable
with another or are they SPECIFICALLY left or right???
