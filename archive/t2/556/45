I find this style of vacuum line 'plumbing' throughout my '80s 
Mercedes-Benz.
Flexible rubber vacuum line at each appliance's fittings and rigid 
plastic line
for the long runs.

the same size and here are some part numbers to try at your local MB 
dealer or
independant parts supplier...

To join several hard vacuum lines in my MB cars, I find two styles of 
moulded
rubber connectors.  Three-way connectors (Y-shaped) and four-way connectors
(X-shaped).  Here are some more MB part numbers...
X-shaped: A 117 078 00 45
Y-shaped: A 117 078 01 45

For you junkyard scroungers, on any '80s vintage MB you'll find a bundle 
of vacuum
lines which pass through the firewall, just to the right of the brake 
booster can.
