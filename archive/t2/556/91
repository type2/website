Just a footnote to this posting.

I know this guy from when I lived there.  He went from the Vanagon to 
a  VW Rabbit Pickup and when that rusted out, moved the powerplant to 
a FWD Dodge model similar to the Rabbit PU.  When that rusted out, he 
went to a Mitsubishi  PU and then to a Toyota.  I talked to him a 
year ago and with the Toyota Pickup, he is up to 50 miles range.  He 
mounts the batteries under the truck and raises the floor of the bed 
by 15 inches for another layer of batteries.  I believe he is still 
using the motor and controller from the original Vanagon project 
though he must have literally gone through a TON of marine batteries.

Still it works for him and he commutes from Quincy, MA to Boston and 
back easily without a recharge which is a good part  of a 50 Mile 
round trip  as I remember.  And he gets highway speed somehow.
