barry,

you method works well.

for those who don't want to deal with finding the parts etc, we have done it
for you already, with our quality fuel pressure gauge kit. i designed this
simple kit myself and we use them on our own busses. it uses a permanently
crimped hose on one end and a reconditioned genuine FI clamp on the other.
