Frankly I agree. While I'd be happy to sell everybody $150 fuel pumps, I
must admit that in my experience the electric one does just fine at a
fraction of the price. 

If there were a solid reason to spend 4x the price I'd be all for it.
But the Facet fuel pump we sell for $39.95 (for carbureted busses) does
the job just fine. The fuel delivery is appropriate for the engine, we
almost never see a defect, and it's a heck of a lot cheaper. Your
carburetor really couldn't care less what type of fuel pump is feeding
it as long as the pressure/volume is within the acceptable range. I have
used the electric pump myself, and also have many customers who have. In
fact people have been putting them on aircooled VW engines for years.
This is nothing new. The only difference is that the mechanical pumps
used to be $59, so many people just stuck with stock. Now that the price
has skyrocketed the situation has changed.

Of course if you feel more comfortable with a $150 pump, then go for it.
Some people just like to "keep it stock," and if you insist of parting
with $150 of your hard-earned money I'll be more than happy to take if
off your hands!  On the other hand,  I just can't buy the argument that
getting a used mechanical pump out of a junkyard, which might last two
years or two days, would be a better choice than a new electric one that
is generally quite reliable. Seems like a risky move for no good reason
to me.

Incidentally, I would concur that installing a relay to make it shut off
if the engine stalls is a good idea for safety's sake.
