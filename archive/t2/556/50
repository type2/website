Subject: RE: [T2] Bus Price ??? What do you think

I just wonder if this vehicle in question has been actually seen--in
person.

Caveat Emptier on checking it out on the internet, and on the seller's
word.

One guy's definition of " Perfect ", or "Mint"  is usually different
than your's.


I've looked at a bunch of allegedly nice stuff out there, that were
actually toilet's--

Caved and Paved, Fluffed and Buffed, to turn over & sell--.

If the Bus hasen't actually been sat in, crawled under, and driven
hard--make zero, zip, nada, commitments---

The excitement and the sweetness of the good deal will soon be lost with
the bitterness of a rat trap--or a mechanical nightmare-

Been there, seen it, done it--:>(

Adios,

I am looking at a stock 1971 bus, in Good condition. Advertised as
having 
rebuilt engine & tranny, Clean body, new paint. And they are dead set on
getting $3,000 for it. This is a California bus, and looks to be in
Good/Great condition. 
So, Is this a 'good' price for this bus, or am I thinking of putting too
much out? 
Thanks,
Matt
