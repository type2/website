I recently aquired a '74 bus.  It appears to have the '73 1700 in it 
(CB) with a two-chamber holley? carb or some hybrid thing with a holley 
electric choke on it.  I am not familiar with holley carbs that are this 
small!.  It also has an electric fuel pump.

The heater blower was not really operational, so I pulled it out for 
now, while I figure out a short in the electricsl (red battery light ON 
while key not in ignition.)

Now, along with the blower was a relay (PN 211963141 ?) with 5 posts on 
it, labeled A, B, J, M, and 31. 

There is apparently no relay for the fuel pump though.  The fuel pump 
appears aftermarket, and has a wire coming out of the top of it, which 
seems to make it pump when some juice that way flows.

So, I have been reading about a double relay thingy for the fuel pump, 
and was wondering if that relay that came out with the blower would 
work, and if so, how to get it wired right. (or if I need it at all, and 
can just run a fused line right from the ignition (+) side of the coil?)

Also, aside from the short in the system,  I have a more immediate 
problem.  The bus will idle for about 5-7 seconds, rev up maybe 100 rpm, 
and die.  This is what got me looking at the fuel pump.  after doing 
some research, I found something about an air flow meter, but isn't that 
just for FI?  I need to get this thing wired up so I can get it out of 
where it is right now, and then get it actually wired up properly.
