Subject: RE: [T2] OUCH $150 for a mechanical fuel pump, how about 

I am not sure I understand, wouldn't using an electric fuel pump be better
than a mechanical one. Especially at that price. No new cars have mechanical
fuel pumps in them nowadays, so they must be better. I have been running one
for the 3 years that I have owned my bus and it has yet to fail me. For that
price, I could have a spare. Just wondering why anyone would go with a
mechanical pump unless they just wanted to be all stock. Just seems like
another part where technology is better now.
