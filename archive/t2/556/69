Subject: Re: [T2] OUCH $150 for a mecahnical fuel pump, how about

And here's what kills me---

Back not too awfully long ago---you could buy a rebuilding kit for any
pump--which consisted of a new diaphram and a spring--wow--maybe
$8.00--OUCH !!

Some pea brain decided that that was waaay too easy--

Now spend the bucks to have either a rebuilder do it-or buy new--

An electric pump is the answer ?

What you guys running in F-Stock, or B-Gas class?  

LOL !!

$150 every 25 years or so for a fuel pump ain't bad... 

FWIW my new Corvair fuel pump was $35 at O'Rielly's Auto Parts.
