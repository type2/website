Subject: photo of diesel

I know you're all tired of hearing my young and therefore foolish ideas of
putting a diesel into my '78 however I'm sticking to the idea and was
wondering if anyone had photos of the engine compartment of a diesel vanagon
and/or someone who lived in either the NY or OH area that would exchange a
beer for a chance for me to take a look at their diesel.

Thanks,

Giles
