Subject: Power Surge

Hi everyone, HapyFriday to ya!!

I am experiencing a power surge.  I feel a slight cut off / cut out every so
often.  Originally thought I was out of gas.  Nope!  Then the battery was
dead.  Replaced.   Still a surge.  I am planning to switch the coil.  For some
reason I think that is the culprit.
Could it be the fuel pump?  I suppose it could be anything.

Your thoughts?
