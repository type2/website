[T2] OUCH $150 for a mecahnical fuel pump, how about electric?!?!?!?!? 
OUCH!!! That 72 Westy I just mentioned also needs a fuel pump. The two
least expensive online retailers list the stock mechanical pump $149 &
$159 !!!!! 
ouch. 

you can just use one of the low pressure pumps. busdepot has a few
different ones from 39.00. no regulator needed.
