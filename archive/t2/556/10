Subject: another 2 westy  question

I am STILL waiting for my bentley to arrive and have been tinkring.... I
removed the Clifford alarm which wasnt working(did the same in my Cabriolet)

I am trying to figure out where the temp guage sender may be? When you turn
the key on the guage just goes to the max, even if the engine isn't running.
i want to know if the problem is in the guage, sender, or wire.

is there any problem using filters(oil, Fuel,Air) from my FLAPS? (the air
filter from fram didn't fit in my cabriolet), or should i go to the dealer
for these?

My speedo is inop. this is my next endeavor.

Thanks for your help
