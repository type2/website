Johnathan,
I'll get you the part number in the morning---
I don't have a can of it here--

I have cases of the stuff---I do know it's avialable--

I have never seen it in quarts--just spray cans.

I'll make a call in the morning--

i just got off the phone with my local paint supply they can get the
mortons stuff but only in quart cans. they say that it doesn't come in
rattle cans like you show on your website. do you have an address for
mortons from the back of the can and possibly a mortons part number for
the rattle can? i did some google searches for mortons paint, and
mortons bed liner but i came up empty.
