Sorry to post this under Jake's title, but Boston Bob is building mine now, a vanagon square port for $2300.  It's strictly stock with mostly new parts and his improvements.  I composed an email to Jake as he suggests, but when I got done with it, I never sent it because I realized that what I wanted was probably better suited to Bob's approach.  WADR to Jake....
