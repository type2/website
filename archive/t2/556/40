It would be lovely to be able to blame it on that but I have to blame it
on an incompetent systems admin who modified httpd.conf then did a reboot
and went off to work WITHOUT "MAKE"ing httpd.conf before doing the reboot.
The problem has been corrected (now that I am home), all is well in
dworkin's den of computer iniquity, and Greg Potts may have an
announcement to make tomorrow (or not, it's up to him :-)
