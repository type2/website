Subject: 10 Digit Vin numbers? 

Hey hey, I've gone to a few sites that let you type in your VIN number,
and their supposed to be able to tell you stuff about your car. (I need
to do a title search for the bus btw) But what I'm assuming is the VIN
(number on the plate behind the windsheild on the dash) is only 10
digits, and they all require 17. Am I NOT getting the right number, or
is a 72 bus just too old to have the 17 numbers? The number I got btw is
2262093801. Is their any site that will help decode NON 17 digit VIN's? 

Kk, thanks in advance
Chris
