Subject: Re: [T2] child seat

An old article I found by Consumer Reports says that those holes being 
without seatbelts are dangerous due to fumes.  Just thought I'd share that - 
can only assume it's true.

I'm looking for the same info myself - for my two year old.  I'd feel better 
if I would put 3-point seatbels in the back (for when he outgrows child 
seats), but that would mean hurting the cabinet on one of the sides of the 
backseat!  Any creative suggestions?
