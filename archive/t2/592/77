Hi Volks!

(Not sure whether this came through, I did not receive it
 back from the list.  My apologies if you got it twice now.)

Me too.  Or rather, re-introduce -- some of the older members
might remember me.  I used to be on here a couple of times
before, a couple of years ago.  Yes, the crazy German with the
panel van complex is back!
 
The panel vans are gone, though, all but one of them.  I have
only two Buses right now, the maybe-still-known panel van:
http://www.gerbelmann.de/gerbelmann.en.html
and the as-yet-unknown-here daily driver kombi:
http://www.gerbelmann.de/delzy.en.html

Both of them are currently not running.  I've re-subscribed
because I plan to remedy that situation.  And of course, because
I missed y'all.  ;-)

If there's anything I can do to help anyone, being German and
living in Germany -- don't hesitate to ask.  Translations, parts
inquries at German dealers, whatever -- if I'm able to help,
I'll be willing to try.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
