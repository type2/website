Subject: Re:71 turn signal switch

Doug,
    The switch for 71 was a one year only part that hasn't been
available new for a few years.  I'm sure that wiring changes could be
made to your bus so that another year VW switch would work but keep in
mind that your brake lights run through your turn signal switch (yep,
I'm sure).  If you invest enough time and money you can make anything
work.
    When I needed a switch for our 71 I got a used one from one of
the vendors that specialize in used bus parts.  That way it was a
sraight forward replacement.
