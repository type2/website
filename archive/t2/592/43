Subject: AIRS - transmission needed

Hi,
I'm helping a couple with a 72 adventurevan who were coming up the coast and
the trans began to moan in 3rd. Didn't pop out of gear but became difficult
to shift.
They towed it to a safe spot and we troubleshot the thing - coupler and
shiftrod worn but okay, but the transmission selector attached to the
coupler is locked up and
won't allow them to shift at all - it's stuck in gear. drained a sampling of
the trans fluid and didn't find metallic flakes, however my feeling is that
the
trans needs work and after trying various methods to unlock the shifter, we
pulled the motor. I don't know enough to tell them whether it's a nosecone
problem or trans
problem, therefore they are under the assumption they need to replace the
whole unit and have their eyes open for a used transmission. Motor is a 78
but I think I can make either an 002 or an 091 work as I have a couple extra
bell housings, etc. if need be.

If anyone has a line on a source for a used 002 or 091 please let me know.
This isn't a huge rush as they found a place to camp/work and are in no
hurry to leave.
Local to the San Francisco area is of course preferable as they're on a
farmer's budget.

Thanks,
