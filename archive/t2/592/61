Subject: Friday Blahs

Blah #1: Stupid exhaust came loose again. HiTemp loctite is useless on
the manifold to head nuts. Grrr... Ordered locking nuts from Bus Depot
along with yet another set of gaskets. Too bad you gotta order 100 of
the nuts. But I guess I'll have spares for a little while... ;-)

Blah #2: Sparks! Smoke! The wire from the headlight switch to the
instrument lights had a nervous breakdown. Melted and started shorting
against anything it could find. Of course, the sparks LOOKED like they
were coming from the headlight switch, not the wire. So I replaced the
switch only to discover the wire was bad. I guess I've got a spare
switch now. :-( But what's with the funky sized spade connectors on
the instrument bulbs? Anybody have/know of a place to get those exact
ones?

Blah #3: Wife just informed me: No $$ for a loooong time to put into
bus. Budget shot. That means no reupholstery, no engine swap, no
welder, no new body panels, etc. :-(

Blah #4: I can't seem to find stiff flexible tubing at around 3/8" -
1/2" OD. I want to make a map light with a LED and I can't seem to
find the flex tube to use for it. Anybody have any solutions? Plastic
or metal, either works.
