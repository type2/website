My '69  Bus (built Sept 68) has no seat-belts in the rear, but it DOES 
(DID) have a total of 16 mounting points in the rear and 8 in the front. 
According to the "french" (It a Swiss market model) user manual the 
seat-belts were available as an option at any VW dealer.... By the way I 
have a 9 passenger model and the spare tire is under the front seat.
Lots of cargo space both in the rear and in the front.  :-)
Cheers,
