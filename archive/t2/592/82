Welcome back, Erik!

A few years ago, Erik, Tobin Copley, Everett Barnes, and I conspired to 
deface an ad for a Lexus SUV, putting a bus in place of the offending 
vehicle in an "adbuster" style spoof. The moment of truth is archived 
at:

But the site in that posting is gone. I know I have found the ad on 
some other site, but now I can't remember where. Anyway, welcome back 
to a first-rate co-conspirator.
