the entire CR thing is different depending on where you ask the
question :) However I sure don't hear of any problems from people who
reassemble an engine back to stock CR's.

one more thing other than getting your CR where you want. having all
the cyls balance out is better. the more balanced it is as an assembly
the longer it should last.
