I was thinking that under some conditions it would be a benefit...
Narrow edges or sharp corners would have their force spread across the
tire's surface instead of just punching through the metal.

Regardless, I have a mount (not yet installed) that I'll be putting on
because I like the way it balances the look of the bus. Plus it gives
more cargo room in the back.
