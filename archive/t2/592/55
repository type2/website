Exactly right.  Anything that increases the crumple zone and helps 
absorb the impact of a crash will make the bus safer in an 
accident.  It may not be better for the nose of the bus, but it is 
better for the passengers.

>Having survived a front end collision on a bus with a front 
mounted spare tire, I have to disagree with you. The spare in my 
accident (T-Boned a Caddy) saved my knees. The tire blew out, the 
rim bent, the mounting bolts tore and the tire shot 15 feet in the 
air (according to bystanders) I was going 15 MPH, the caddy 40.
