He was quite correct in the +/- temperature differental. Back in 89
someone had come up with a method of reducing that error down to +/- 3
degrees by replacing the kit long wire with a piece of bi-metalic
thermocouple wire.

At Pomona,  I met the "Inventor" of the  " Berg oil temp sender unit" if
this is what you mean about the oil sender on the dip stick ?
According to
him these senders could be off by 10-15 degrees--either way--TWWM, uj
