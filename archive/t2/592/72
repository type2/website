I parted out a '73 here in Cookeville. Offered it all up for free. You'd think I was giving away sickness in a bottle b/c only 2 folks expressed interest. That was 6 years ago. Took the last door to the recycler about 3 months ago during a spring cleanup around here. 

The '73 did go to the crusher alot lighter. This was pre-Ebay of course. I've still got the engine for parts which I needed. 

Was sort of sad. This local fellow (with various illegal habits) told me to come get it for free. Had to get it off his parent's property. We started hacking it up and 3 weeks later he shows up wanting money for the bus (I figure he needed some cash for a "purchase"). Told him he was welcome to take the bus back home if he wanted it but I had no money to offer (which was true). Last I heard from him.
