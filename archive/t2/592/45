Subject: RE: (T2) Child Seat

To all:
I was just writing Greg Potts back and telling him that a VW representative 
had told me that the front tire should make a slight difference in one's 
favor in a head-on collision accident.  Does anyone else have 
experience/knowledge about this, and is it a widely-held belief/fact that 
the front tire is useless or even more dangerous in a head-on?  If so, I'm 
really disappointed in the guy who told me it would make the bus/passengers 
safer!
Thanks-
Marya
