Subject: STUCK VALVE

Hello everyone,

Well it finally caught me.
After 3,000 miles the used head i put on my engine
now has a stuck intake valve on #1 piston.
Question is, what causes a valve to be stuck, like no movement.
and is there any way to make my engine last another
30 miles to get home?

thank you very much,
Darren
