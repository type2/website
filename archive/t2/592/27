Subject: Re: [T2] Compression Ratio and New Heads

Jason,

1.  Compression ratios are generally raised by cutting metal
    *from* the sealing surface of the heads where they meet the pistons.
    Heads from your supplier should be pretty much stock in that 
    department....probably best to cc them anyway....and at that point
    would result in a CR of about stock....not 8:1.

2/3 cc them and then read the books to see how close you want to be.
    All of them being equal would result in smoother better power...
    at the expense of several hours of labor(or machine work).

4.  If you are in to this, then buy the Fischer book..."how to Hot Rod 
    Your Volkswagen Engine" and read it, and then read it again and again 
    until you know what they are talking about and how to modify your 
    heads slightly to make cc's match.  Don't touch your heads till
    after that!

You can always put it together just like at the factory...I can guarantee 
you that they never cc'd a t4 head...except maybe the first time they came 
out of the casting machine...just to be sure that it wasn't too far off
from all the others and would give something close to the correct CR.

Never add shims to the top of a cylinder to change the CR.  That would
make your heads sit lopsided a little on top of the cylinders...among many 
other things bad about doing that.

Cheers, dave
