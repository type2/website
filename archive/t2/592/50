Subject: spare tire and crash safety

"From: Greg Potts <Greg(-at-)pottsfamily.ca>

Please don't think that the front-mounted spare is there for crash 
protection. In practice an inflated tire and rim on the nose of a bus 
will INCREASE the deformation of the bus's nose in the event of a 
collision."
 
Greg,
Having survived a front end collision on a bus with a front mounted spare tire, I have to disagree with you. The spare in my accident (T-Boned a Caddy) saved my knees. The tire blew out, the rim bent, the mounting bolts tore and the tire shot 15 feet in the air (according to bystanders) I was going 15 MPH, the caddy 40. The front end was pushed in 4" and the windshield cracked, and the front end was 1/2" from my right knee after the accident. I have zero (absolutly no) doubt that if that spare tire hadnt absorbed as much impact as it had, Id be called hop along now. Maybe the nose was more deformed after the accidnet, but I didnt give a rats ass. I was just glad that no one was hurt.
 
I think the missconception that you are under is that the spare tire is made to hold the weight of the whole car on its side, which it is not. Its designed to hold 1/4 of that weight standing up. I will tell you from my expierence that the tire will blow in a colision, and I it will distribute the impact over a wider area.
