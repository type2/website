...After 3,000 miles the used head i put on my engine
now has a stuck intake valve on #1 piston.
Question is, what causes a valve to be stuck, like no movement.
and is there any way to make my engine last another
30 miles to get home?

REPLY:

Darren, are you sure the valves were quite free when you installed the head?  
Or did you install the head without checking?  I've encountered a couple of 
aircooled engines that at one time made nice homes for mice -- who built nests 
in the heads just where the cooling air would enter.  Pretty quickly that area 
of the head will overheat and the valve will stick.  Not tough to fix, but 
labor intensive in terms of tear-down and reassembly.

Concerning the 30 miles home, you might make it but if freeway/interstate 
highways are part of the route, there are safety issues for YOU as well as the 
engine.  Pay the tow guy.  You have enough to work on when you get the vehicle 
home... just my 2".      Good luck, Glenn
