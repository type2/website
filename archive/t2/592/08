Subject: jumping starter

I have a Bosch starter in a 79. Bently says that I can try and jump the starter by bridging the 50 and 30 terminals on the solenoid. 50 is the one that the positive battery cable connects to. There are two push on terminals and another nut. The nut looks like it connects to the starter. Anyone know which one is 30?
 
Many thanks,
Colby
