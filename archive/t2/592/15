Re: manuals

Besides Bentley there is diagnostic information in the booklet that Bus Depot sells that it's shared among a few VW models besides the bus. The yellow Workshop manual has a lot of information on the 003 and 010 transmission but it largely pertains to rebulding them. Diagrams are excellent though.
