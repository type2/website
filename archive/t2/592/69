Well the guy bought the short block from some company in california and put 
new P/C's on it and rebuilt heads. We are hoping it's in great shape.

Yea, maybe we should just crush it eh? But it does have a title and it has a 
lot of good parts on it, if nobody wants to save it then it should be 
properly parted out though right?

I guess I just don't want to be an accomplice to someone that crushes an 
early bus, that's just so sad. I can understand if it was completely parted 
out and it was crushed but I know people need things off it it like the good 
tranny and maybe the glass and doors and such.

Nobody needs a good 71 tranny?
