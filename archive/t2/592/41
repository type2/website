Hi Marya,

If you want a three point belts in the back seat of a 1970 Riviera 
you're probably going to have to mount *something* to a cabinet, or 
modify the cabinetry somehow. I am no expert on early bay's buses or 
Rivieras but IIRC the factory didn't start putting mounting brackets in 
for a shoulder belt until well into the 70's.

Please don't think that the front-mounted spare is there for crash 
protection. In practice an inflated tire and rim on the nose of a bus 
will INCREASE the deformation of the bus's nose in the event of a 
collision. Remember that rim and tire are designed to support the 
weight of a 5700 lb bus, not to act as a crumple zone. All that being 
said, I have my spare on the nose of my bus; because I like having more 
space inside the bus for my gear. I just try to drive attentively 
enough to compensate.

YMMV.

Happy trails,
