Hi Folks,

Thanks for all the helpful responses.  I think I have a better handle on 
what's what with regard to CR, head CC's, deck height, and cylinder CC's.  
The aircooled.net calculator is a nice easy way to run numbers quickly.  
Hopefully I'll have some real numbers after doing some real measurements 
this weekend.

Praise be to the mighty List!
