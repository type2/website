Subject: Re: [T2] child seat

Yes except we'd like to have another child and I can imagine two kids (e.g. 
ages 6 and 9) needing safe places to sit in the back.  Studies have shown a 
lot of damage can come from wearing just a 2 point seatbelt (not that it's 
better to go without one, of course).  Granted it's a risk to even drive the 
bus with children - or adults! - in the bus, but I guess I'm just trying to 
convince myself I'm doing everything I can to make it safer.  Aint just a 
river in Egypt, ya know...

Also, to the person who first asked about seatbelts, be sure your bus has 
the spare tire in the front; you need to be safe, too!
