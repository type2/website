Subject: Vanagon fuel line? vs. stuff you can buy anywhere.

Hi,

I'm replacing a couple of my injectors on my '80 and am wondering
about the fuel hose.

It looks relatively new but on checking vw retailers they seem
to stock something stock or close to stock described as
7mm German fuel line, High Pressure, Reinforced.

...so is reinforced fuel line you find at Salvo or Pep Boys basically
the same thing?

Thanks...


Sincerely,
