Thanks!  Most appreciated.

One thing though: Please do not send me a copy of mail
directed to the list.  I get it twice then, and since the
list mail is collected in a different folder I read later
than the normal mail folder, I tend to answer mail in
private that should really go to the list.  Thank you.
(This is not directed at Mark specifically, but at 
everyone.)

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
