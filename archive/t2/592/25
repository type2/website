Subject: Last Call: 10mm reversible gearwrench

Hey -  this is a 'share the wealth'  deal.  Good karma all around!!

I have 4 players (Corbet, Don, Greg and Faster). With just four players and 
me, I will be able to mail the wrenches to your USA address for $10.

If I get 6 more players, I will mail to everyone's USA address for $9!!  (I 
get to save the $6.95 shipping on first time orders of $99)

11 x $8.08 = $88.88, plus a 19mm REVERSIBLE gear wrench for me at $13.xx 
would be the order.

Man, you can't beat that with a stick ! ! !   These are PERFECT for the 
distributor lock nut!  Reversible, just like your ratcheting socket .

BTW, for local Northern Virginia people and people going to BOTC, you can 
pick and choose just what you want from the site, but I cannot USPS mail any 
other wrenches because of the weight and extra cost to me to mail out.

If I do not get some quick responses, I will make the min order for the five 
of us.  But I will cut off at the $99 mark, regardless

'72 Westy up on blocks (with official '72 VA plates - vintage)
'76 hightop Safare needing love (w/orange VA antique plates)
'78 Westy reliable daily driver (w/vanity plates 6PAC 2GO)
'77 invisible bus (w/vanity plates ARMY 08)

Hey, Fairfax County Virginia busers.  I opened my mail last night and I 
received FREE county stickers for the '72 and the '76.  I will be the first 
one on the block with new county stickers!!  The '72 is 'vintage' because of 
its license plate, and the '76 is officially 'antique' with VA issued 
antique license plates.  The county stickers are normally $25 each!!
