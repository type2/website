>I have a Bosch starter in a 79. Bently says that I can try and jump the starter by bridging the 50 and 30 terminals on the solenoid. 50 is the one that the positive battery cable connects to. There are two push on terminals and another nut. The nut looks like it connects to the starter. Anyone know which one is 30?

30 is the big one that all the large cables go to including the battery and alternator cable. 50 (and there are two terminals) go to the double relay and the ignition switch. The other nut connects the solenoid to the starter shell which is the ground because it connects to the transmission/engine which is grounded to the body.

Short 50 to 30 and it's the same as using the ignition key to engage the starter.

See this guide to Bosch terminal numbering:
