right the tranny is in the front, then the final drive then the engine...
the tranny takes Dextron ATF, the final drive takes 90WT Gear oil and the
engine takes oil.   I use Synthetic in all 3 and unlike the manual trannys
you can put GL-3 or 4 in the final drive because there are no syncronizers
which is what is messed up by GL-4.
