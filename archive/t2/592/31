I agree with everything Gary says but there is one addition step that I 
recommend you take.  When the engine is out, check for radial play in 
the main bearing (thrust bearing).  I also had my engine in and out 
three times and did, in fact, replace both the main-seal and the 
flywheel.  After pulling it out the third time, I realized that the 
radial crankshaft play was so excessive that it was impossible for any 
seal to hold back the flow of oil.  Obviously, the solution was a long 
block!  Ouch.
