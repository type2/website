Subject: vanagon seats in '77 bay

Hey, I've been on the list a few months and am new to air-cooled VW
but thought I'd chime in. My ' 71 hightop has swivel vanagon seats.
They work great, slide on tracks fine and its nice to have them
rear-facing when camping. I didn't install them so I can't vouch for
how easy it was.
