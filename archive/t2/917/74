Subject: Re: [T2] Lifter Conversion-rocker arm diffs

OK, so the hydraulic rocker arms have spacers between them, can I make my 
own spacers for my solid rocker arms, or am I safer to use a set of hyd. 
rocker arms? If so, who's got a set of these and rods, and GOOD used tappets 
to sell? I'm going to be pulling my pushrod tubes to put new seals in 
anyway, since my engine likes to leave a good saucer sized mark wherever I 
pull in these days. :-( Might as well do the hyd. conversion while I'm at 
it!!
