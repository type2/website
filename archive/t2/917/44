Subject: Re: [T2] vanagon seats in '77 bay

Hi Ryan,

Installing those in a pre-75 bus would require major surgery. The  
bulkhead behind the passenger would have to be cut out and a gusset  
installed, after which the seat bases would need to be welded in.

Are you SURE it's a 71???  Has it got an upright engine and a wrap- 
around front bumper??


Happy Trails,
