Wow, your daughter does a lot of driving!  Mine has about 33K on her 
converted 75 bus (top end rebuild to include rods and hydraulics) and no 
issues except she has to warm it up to remove lifter clatter if she 
leaves it parked in the dorm lot over 3 days.  She gets 22 mpg on the 
highway driving at 65 mph all the way from NJ to Georgia 4 times a 
school year.
quoth karl:
  my daughter have over 400,000 miles on two
  different 77 Westies with the original solid cams and
  good used VW hydraulic lifters, steel pushrods, and
  the spacers between the rockers.
