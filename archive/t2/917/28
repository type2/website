Subject: Re: [T2] Lifter Conversion

I have been watching this thread, and it brings to mind that some people are saying there is NO difference between hydraulic and solid camshafts, or if there is, it's minimal and not really an issue? I'm thinking of switching to hydraulics as well, but NOT if it entails splitting the case for a new cam. Anyone who KNOWS, or has done this, care to comment? Is your van running fine with a solid cam, and hydraulic lifters? What about the rocker arms, are they the same?
