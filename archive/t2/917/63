So I get to the points adjustment, and after I figure out what's what,
where the points are and how far they need to be, I reassemble the
distributor, and everything seemed fine.  But now it's not starting.  It
turns over, but it doesn't fire up.

Does any one have any suggestions what this could be.  I apologize for my
lack of knowledge, but I'm just learning.  Thanks for you're responses in
advance.

Don't apologize for lack of knowledge.  The only crime is lack of
willingness to learn.

When you say that you are adjusting the points .016 from the lobes, do you
mean that you are measuring a clearance between the cam lobe and the
rubbing surface on the points?  If so, that is your problem.

The points should open .016 when the rubbing surface is on the tip of the
lobe.  They should be completely closed when the rubbing surface is
between the lobes.

That being said, setting the point gap is just a way to get the engine
running.  After you have it running, you should adjust the points with a
dwell meter.
