Subject: RE: [T2] Lifter Conversion

Hi, Thanks very much for everyone's advice. Thanks, Dave, for the link.

My cam showed up today. It's an Engle and says in the insert that it is good 
for solid or hyd. lifters. So I may stay with what I have. I dunno. If I 
switched to hyd., does that increase my power? What is the advantage of hyd. 
over solid?

I don't really mind adjusting valves every so often. It gives my neighbor, 
an old retired farmer, something to tease me about... I'm afraid that if I 
weren't doing the valves every so often he just might dry up and blow 
away...

Thanks!!
George
