Subject: '76 FI starts but runs only 3 seconds

I have tried to search the list regarding the non-running of my bus  
and I've found several similar problem postings, but it is difficult  
to locate the final resolutions. So, I am posting in hopes of  
refining my troubleshooting efforts.

Symptoms:
a. Starts normally and runs for around 3 seconds.
b. While running, it sounds normal.
c. No unusual sounds when it dies.
d. I can usually restart right away several times in a row.
e. Sometimes, if I give it just the right amount of gas, I can keep  
it running - managed to do this for a whole minute.
f. The AFM connector is 7 pin style; if I disconnect it, engine will  
start and run at idle indefinitely.

Tests/Other Conditions
a. Coil is new (Bosch blue);  system has Pertronix Hall module
b. Double Relay is new (Bosch)
c. Air filter is new (unrelated, but still true)
e. Fuel pressure is 38 psi on my gauge (same as when I last tested 9  
years ago)
d. Temp Sensor II is okay (didn't write down the number - but it was  
reasonable)
e. Ran several ohmmeter tests on AFM:
	1. measure between pins 6/9: reading was 285 ohm (OK range is 100-300)
	2. measure between pins 7/8: reading was 163 ohm (OK range is 80-120)
	3. measure between pins 6/27 (Temp Sensor I): reading was 2600 ohm  
(OK range is up to 2500, but temp was 65'F, Bentley says should  
measure above 68'F)
	4. measure between pins 36/39 (Fuel pump contacts):
	    a. with flap closed resistance was open circuit
	    b. with flap open resistance was < 2 ohms

I guess that leaves Cold Start Valve, Thermo-Time Switch and Aux Air  
Regulator.

Where would you test next? Also, is there a way to connect a Remote  
Starter Switch on an FI system? I tried both of the small pins on the  
solenoid and both resulted only in turning on the Fuel Pump?!? This  
would be handy since my wife doesn't seem to enjoy helping with this  
and I don't really want the three year old learning how to start a  
car just yet.  :)

Any help appreciated!
