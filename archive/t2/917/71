What the hydraulic lifters do is eliminate the "slop"
in the valvetrain. With solid lifters, enough
clearance has to be engineered into the valvetrain so
that when fully heated to operating temp, there is
(theoretically) no more clearance anywhere but the
valves are allowed to fully seat, so the entire
valvetrain cannot be too tight... thus the setting
with a feeler gauge that is as thick as the amount of
expansion. At all times that there is still a gap, the
parts are battering each other.

Hydraulic lifters adjust for that expansion and if all
the components are properly matched, there is no gap
AND the valves seat fully and you never have to worry
about adjusting anything. That's the theory. There is
a certain amount of compromise built into the
hydraulic lifter valvetrain, so there may be times
that there id slight valve float or slight loosenes,
but virtually undetectable.

There is no horsepower difference, but if you are
racing your engine, you will likely use solid lifters
or roller lifters and you'll likely adjust them just a
tad loose (the solid ones) but for the normal driving
applications, hydraulics are actually easier on your
engine and less costly in the loooonnnnggg run. That
is, in theory. -BaH
