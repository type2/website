There are some folks who seriously disagree there. But IMHO it's a
moot point. Other things are more likely to fail causing a teardown
before the difference becomes apparent.

My only concern is aftermarket lifters. I have yet to find someone
who's run the "racing" hydraulics sold by aircooled.net. So I'll
probably use a new webcam (is it the 107i I'm thinking of? I
forget...) with the stock lifters in this 79 engine I'm building.
