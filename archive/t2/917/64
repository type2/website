	We normally assume that a given breakdown is caused by just 
one defect.  That is often true, is may be an exception.  It may turn 
out that the first trouble  -  engine quit  -  is not particularly 
connected with the later refusal to turn over.
	I once experienced on a '90 Nissan vanette (A15 motor) a 
sudden engine stop  -  well, such startling stumbling that I stomped 
down the clutch and switched the ignition off.  The trouble turned 
out to be that the main EGR pipe had broken off.  That sort of 
nonsense is one of the many reasons I've reverted to the '73 T2  - 
no EGR or any other antipollution eqpt.  Has your VW some EGR which 
may have become disconnected, PM?
	I'm simply pointing to the possibility that any later 
difficulty turning the motor over may be essentially unrelated to the 
original stop.  We don't seek such complexity, but it does turn up 
unwanted now & again  ...
