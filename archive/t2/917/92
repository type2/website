Subject: RE: manual choke cable ?

My chokes are deactivated ... I have not done it myself, but I believe that
you simply open the boxes and adjust the mechanism in a way that it cannot
be engaged. I still keep the wires attached to the heating elements since I
need them for the idle cutoff solenoids and I rather have the connectors on
the chokes that dangling around and possible shorting out against the carb
body.

I could even drive it in German winters without the chokes.

	Alternatively, has anyone tried abolishing the choke 
altogether?  The climate in N. New Zealand is similar to N. Calif; on 
the coldest mornings, can one simply blip the accelerator to shove in 
a couple squirts from the accelerator pump, and start OK without any 
choke?  And if that works, is there point in removing the choke shaft 
& plate to allow slightly freer breathing?
