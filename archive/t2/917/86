Subject: Re: [T2] manual choke cable ?

The only choke cable listed for the splittie is 111 711 501 A (it also fits
Bug thru 1960), length is 148 7/16".  The knobbed end fits below the front
seat on the seat pedestal.  Dunno if it would be long enough.

The Karmann Ghia cable (141-711-501) is longer at 161 7/32" - longer because
of the way it is routed.  A bit harder to find these days as the application
(56-60) is so narrow.
