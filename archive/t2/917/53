Subject: A duct tape & coat hanger fix

Last night after a long day of college classes, I get into my 69 Bus go down 
all five stories of the parking garage around the corner and half way up the 
really BIG and STEEP hill my gas pedal went to the floor.  My throttle cable 
broke! Eeeek!

OK, I am 40 mile from home and I refuse to get a perfectly funtional Bus 
towed!(not to mention the expense).

So I had to get inventive.  I figured out the cable snapped about 25 cm (10 
inches) from the carburetor.  Lucky me, I had a coat hanger which I 
striaghtened and fished down throught the orginal hole and connected to the good end of 
the existing cable with spare barrel nut and duct tape.

Total time to fix was about 45 minutes.  Most of that time was spent figuring 
out what to do.

Drove the 37 miles home.  Ordered a new throttle cable this morning, it 
should be here on Tuesday  Hopefully it last until then.

Happy Trails,

Brian
