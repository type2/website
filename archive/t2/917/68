Subject: Re: [T2] First time points adjustment...

Some of my own personal oopsies when messing with points or ignition
over the years:

Wire at coil "+" knocked loose
Mixed up firing order of spark plug wires on distributor cap
Forgot to put rotor back on before clamping cap down
Cap clamped down backwards
Cap not fully clamped down
Points wire not plugged into spade connector inside distributor
Green wire from points not plugged into coil "-"
Green wire from points plugged into coil "+" instead
One or more plug wires loose at cap
One or more plug wires loose at plug
Coil wire loose at coil or cap
.016" doesn't equal anywhere near 48* dwell
Somehow got grease on the points contact pads

This is all I can think of at the moment. I was destroyed by work this
past week, and spent the day with the family (always exhausting,
though fun) so my brain is completely fried.
