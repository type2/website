(addy below) I suspect you have your fuel pump
connection on the starter switch connector.

Check your double relays connections. It seems to be
in this circuit - the fuel pump runs off the solenoid
when key is in start position / starter operating.
Fuel pump builds pressure in fuel line and the engine
runs off that pressurized fuel after starter is
disengaged until pressure runs out. I can't figure how
the engine keeps running indefinitely with the AFM
disconnected tho - that is what engages the double
relay to power the fuel pump while there is airflow
into engine. Maybe a screwed up ground at the double
relay? That brown wire that connects to one of the
sheetmetal screws holding the relays / resistor pack
often comes loose. There have been issues posted
recently about the double relay large plastic
multi-wire "plugs" with loose individual wire / socket
within.
Concentrate your efforts in this area. -BaH
