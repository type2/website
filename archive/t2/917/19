George,

Webcam sells solid lifter cams.
There web page is hard to find(in a way) because ofthe references to web 
"cameras".

Here you are.   http://www.webcamshafts.com/

Their #73 would peobably be a good choice for stockish engine with fi.



Since you are goingto have to buy new lifters anyway.....

Cheers, dave
