Subject: Remote Start Switch question

In the last few days I have been doing some testing on my bus ('76  
FI) and was unable to get the starter to kick over using a remote  
start switch that I know worked in the past. I know the unit was  
connected correctly - 1 lead to the Battery terminal on the solenoid  
and 1 lead to the ignition terminal. Even with the ignition key off,  
the solenoid should be activated, but the remote start switch just  
did not work. (I tested with ignition key on and off and with the  
wire to the ignition terminal of the solenoid on and off - no joy.)

a) As a test touched a short wire between the battery terminal and  
the ignition terminal and the solenoid was activated. (ignition key  
off, tranny in neutral, E brake on)

b) Ohmmed remote start switch and found < 1 ohm when ON

Sounds to me as if the remote switch isn't working, but the question  
is why? I would think that 10A available current would be more than  
adequate for the solenoid.  Any ideas?

thanks,
