Hi P.

Two thoughts come to mind:

A. Have you checked to see if the engine is spinning freely? Are you
100% certain it's in neutral?  If it's locked up for some reason then
it's not the starter that's at fault.

B. Check the entire current path from battery - starter - tranny -
chassis -battery. ALL of those connections need to be clean and
secure, or it won't charge OR start reliably.

To answer your questions.

1. Unlikely.
2. Possibly.
3. Unlikely.
4. Dunno... My alternator is different from yours, and it's too wet
outside to climb under the bus right now anyway.


Happy Trails,
