Subject: RE: [T2] EGR system

My 77 has no vacuum nipple, but you might have a
different valve (electric?)

Supposedly the EGR does serve to reduce cyclinder
temps, thus enhancing head life.  Unfortunately, it is
a half-&ss system...the $170 filter will corrode from
the inside out in a matter of weeks, and little pieces
of crap will make their way into the EGR valve and EGR
tube in the manifold.  The EGR tube will clog up
annually, requiring a R&R of the manifold to clean.
The EGR valve is a pretty expensive rebuilt if you
wear that out.  Note: many PO's block off the valve
and/or filter, so if you want the thing to work, take
all the components off and make sure they are not
blocked by metal plates.

My state requires it for smog, so I do use it
occasionally.  When it's not installed I notice
slightly more power, so I just avoid full-throttle
operation to prevent running the CHT's too hot (still
not certain if the EGR makes that big a difference,
but I'm sure my heads will last longer with less
power)
