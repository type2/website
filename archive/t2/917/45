Re feet not reaching the floor using higher vangagon seats- in our 78 we 
put one of those flat tool/emergency stuff holders (Rubbermaid??-think I 
saw it in a truck shop) which are about 4": high and fit perfect in the 
floor space.  We keep flares, siphon hose, spare gas cap, air pump, hunk 
of wire, flashlight, etc in there.
