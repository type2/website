Subject: carb for 1600

	The Brazilian Weber on my 1600 dual port managed to foul all 
the plugs within a few mi after the motor rebuild.  I gather that 
when that type of carb is too worn there's nothing practical to do
with it.
	I have found a 34 PICT but one longtime VW mechanic tells me 
a 30 PICT from the 1500 is a far better carb.
	Any opinions welcome!

thanx
