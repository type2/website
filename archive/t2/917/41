Subject: Re:Are rocker panels considered 'structural integrity' pieces

Please name a few of the adhesives, and direct me to web sites that 
describe and sell them. I'll study whatever is out there and try to form an 
opinion.  And maybe use them on my own bus.

I'm thinking of using the new autobody adhesives that are available now, 
instead of welding in my inner and outer rocker panels.
