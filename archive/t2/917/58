Now I'm ashamed! I almost always say to grab hold of
each and every hose and confirm that it is connected
solidly and that it doesn't crumble under your grip!
The "3 seconds" had me going on the double relays and
the fuel pump only runs when connecting the remote
switch tied in... Check out that photo in my album to
see where to connect your remote starter.
Glad you got it running anyway and carry that double
relay with you everywhere. If you don't have it, they
WILL fail! -BaH
