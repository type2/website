Subject: Are rocker panels considered 'structural integrity' pieces on

I'm thinking of using the new autobody adhesives that are available now, instead of welding in my inner and outer rocker panels These are the parts on cip.ca listed as 
   
TAB-402-501  
   
TAB-402-431  
My only concern, is if these need to be welded in for stuctural rigidity. The new adhesives state they are for the use of rocker panels etc, but just wondering what people's opinions are.
Thanks,
Courtney
