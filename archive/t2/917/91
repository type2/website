Subject: RE: Remote Start Switch question

I would suspect dirt and corrosion on the main power terminal on the
starter. You don't need a lot of current to engage the solenoid, but it may
be enough to cause a rather large voltage drop over decades worth of dirt
and corrosion on the starter terminal.

I just fixed a no-start condition yesterday by cleaning battery terminals
..
