Subject: Are rocker panels considered 'structural integrity' pieces on

Courtney -- 
            The title "Canadian Association of Insolvency and Restructuring 
Professionals" and its French translation appear when I go to www.cip.ca 

A bit puzzling since there was a rust panel repair company called TAB in the 
Cleveland, Ohio, vicinity... may still be in business.  I used their products 
circa 1980 on a couple of microbuses showing cancer from Chicago salt.

As to welding vs. adhesives, part of the question would be, "How do you intend 
to use the vehicle?"  If you are going to load it with heavy objects and bounce 
over rough roads, I'd think welding is essential.  If you are just doing a nice 
Sunday driver restoration for appearance....

If you do weld, remember to treat the inside of the welds with rust 
preventative materials, OTW you'll be back where you started in a few years.

I'm thinking of using the new autobody adhesives that are available now, 
instead of welding in my inner and outer rocker panels These are the parts on 
cip.ca listed as   TAB-402-501    TAB-402-431
 
My only concern, is if these need to be welded in for stuctural rigidity. The 
new adhesives state they are for the use of rocker panels etc, but just 
wondering what people's opinions are.
