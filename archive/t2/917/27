Subject: Re: [T2] carb for 1600

The problem with running a 30PICT series carburetor on a dual port engine is
that it will starve at high RPMs (where the vehicle is at freeway/highway
speeds), thus there will be a loss of power, especially for hill climbing,
something that the Type 2 is already deficient in accomplishing under the
best ideal "stock" conditions.

Your long-time VW mechanic is partially right.  The 30PICT is a far better
carb - but for 1500/1600 SINGLE Port Engines.  The 4mm larger throttle bore
size DOES make a difference.

As a side note, the 30PICT series carb was used on Dual Port Engines in
Europe and other countries - BUT - with 1200 or 1300 displacement.
