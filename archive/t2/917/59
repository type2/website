You're right about the 31s having an air screw, but the one I've been
running on my '71 for years has been anything but finicky.  Plopped it on,
adjusted it a bit, and it's been running fine.

I think that a lot of the PICT-3's bad press is because the air bypass
circuit becomes a lot more finicky when the throttle shaft gets worn.
Otherwise, you just treat the big air screw like you treated the throttle
position ("idle speed") screw on the PICT-1 carburators.
