Subject: First time points adjustment...

Hey, I'm trying to tune up my bus for the first time, having no previous experience or knowledge.  I'm using Mr. Muir's idiot's guide.  So I get to the points adjustment, and after I figure out what's what, where the points are and how far they need to be, I reassemble the distributor, and everything seemed fine.  But now it's not starting.  It turns over, but it doesn't fire up.  

I checked all of the wires, spark plugs, rotors, caps, everything is where it should be, and the points are adjusted .016" from the lobes.  Does any one have any suggestions what this could be.  I apologize for my lack of knowledge, but I'm just learning.  Thanks for you're responses in advance.

-Rob
