Subject: Lifter Conversion

Hi all... After a search of the archives I determined that it may be a good 
idea to convert from solid to hydraulic lifters. The engine is disassembled 
in the garage awaiting a camshaft after finding that one of the current 
lobes is quite flat...So it's a winter project.

It's hard to find the solid lifter cam that I need, and I've been 
searching.... So I bought a 77 cam for hyrdaulic lifters.

So my question is this... I believe (from the archives) that I have to 
change out the lifters and push rods. Is there anything else that I should 
swap out (in terms of the lifter situation) while I have it all torn down? 
Or anything special that I should know about doing this other than the 
normal reassembly of my engine?
