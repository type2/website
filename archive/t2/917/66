Yeah, I've been following that technology for a couple years now. It's
got amazing potential. I can't find the link since my laptop dumped,
but there is another company playing with a paint-on material that can
do similar things. It's just a matter of laying down an ultrafine wire
mesh and painting this electrically sensitive paint over it.

Can you imagine being able to change your vehicle's color, pattern,
logos, etc, on the fly?
