Subject: RE: vanagon seats in my 77 Bay

I carry my tools in a small hardsided suitcase, about 5 inches deep and 
almost the size of the passenger-side footwell.
Wife appreciates it as a footstool. I appreciate having the tools handy, 
and the weight is over the front wheels.

I have vanagon seats in my 79 Camper which I like but my fiance's feet
don't hit the floor passenger side!  Any snazy foot stool ideas...
