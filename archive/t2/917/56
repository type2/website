I'm not satisfied that you've proven the engine does
not turn over. You can try pushing the bus in 4th
gear, you can raise one wheel and try turning it while
in 4th gear, you can remove all 4 spark plugs (to
eliminate compression) and try turning with the
fanbelt or the two methods I mentioned BEFORE you
assume the worst.
When the engine died, did the bus screech to a stop,
wheels locked up? Did it try to keep running for a
bit?

HOW ABOUT - did you recover all the pieces of the
broken bracket, bolt, etcetera or might something be
jammed under the crankshaft pulley?

Try turning the crankshaft from the nut on the end.

Hmmm... Replaced starter? Maybe wrong starter and not
engaging to flywheel ring gear properly? -BaH
