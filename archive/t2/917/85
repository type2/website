Subject: manual choke cable ?

	I've always hated automatic chokes, and want to convert my 
'73 Bay to manual.  Has anyone done this before?  An obvious source 
for the cable might seem a scrapped Splittie  -  but is that cable 
long enough?
	Alternatively, has anyone tried abolishing the choke 
altogether?  The climate in N. New Zealand is similar to N. Calif; on 
the coldest mornings, can one simply blip the accelerator to shove in 
a couple squirts from the accelerator pump, and start OK without any 
choke?  And if that works, is there point in removing the choke shaft 
& plate to allow slightly freer breathing?
