Subject: Accelerator issue

Hey folks. Having a problem with my accelerator. 
I thought it would just be the cable, but I was
lucky enough to find a more complex issue.  It
seems I have a problem with a part underneath the
front floor.  I have no idea what it is called
but it is the part to which the accelerator cable
connects.  It seems to have once connected to a
mounting point on the body (sort of a box shaped
contraption) via a pin.  The part that connects
the accelerator cable to the rod from the
accelerator pedal is still present but the part
that connected to the body is gone.  

Any idea of the name of the part?  Any sources or
am I looking at junkyard items only?  I have
access to a 78 junker.  Will it's part fit my 70?
 

Also, is this a common high mileage wear issue or
is the cause more like the silly door hinge that
was once used to repair accelerator pedal?  

Thanks in advance and happy bussin'
Ray
