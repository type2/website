Subject: Re: [T2] vanagon seats in my 77 Bay

Hi Courtney,

One other minor detail just occurred to me... Those fancy armrests on  
the late-vanagon seats do come with one additional drawback: The  
seats do not recline backwards as far as an orginal late-bay seat  
will go.

It's a PITA for the co-pilot on a long road trip. AMHIK.


Happy Trails,
