Subject: Re: deactivating idle cutoff (was: manual choke cable) ?

It was a while ago,but I remember in our 71 Camper I disabled the cutoff 
solenoid -unscrewed it, clipped the plunger end, and put it back minus 
its wire.  Never had run on problems.  I recall doing this on an around 
the country trip in 76 where either the solenoid failed or the wire. I 
also remember creating a manual choke from 2 cables that were joined in 
the area over the spare tire well, fastened each cable housing to a 
plate and leaving an open area where the joined cable could slide back 
and forth about 1.3 inches.  The pull knob was fastened in the wall 
behind the driver seat and designed so pulling opened the choke plate, 
and pushing it closed the plate.  This insures it can always be 
unchoked. I don't remember how I fastened this to the choke arm, but I 
think I took apart the bimetallic strip housing.
