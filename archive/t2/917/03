Ok, I'll bite. How do you fix that? I've got a broken lower pin on my
'72 that makes the vent window unusable


OK, to fix the pivot pin at the bottom of the front vent wings or the
drivers side window in the back, first the glass has to be pried out of the
frame (very carefully and slowly-I'm also assuming  the window has been
removed from the bus) I used an ice pick, sliding it in under the glass to
kind of break the seal. Once the glass is out what's left of the pin should
come right out. Take it to a hardware store and find a hitch pin the same
diameter (this will be a long, maybe 1 1/2-2" pin with a flat round head
and several holes drilled through the shaft. Cut the hitch pin the same
length as the original pin, about 3/4" IIRC. Now, you need a bench grinder.
Grind two opposite sides of the head of the pin flat, so it is oval shaped.
The head of the pin will also be too thick, so grind down the thickness of
the head as well. This may be stating the obvious, but hold the pin with a
pair of vice grips as it will get VERY hot. Once the pin is ground into
shape, drop it through the hole in the frame, with the flat sides laying in
the channel, and replace the glass, again carefully-it may need to tapped a
little with a rubber mallet to seat it fully into the frame, also reinstall
the tensioner around the pin. It took me about 45 minutes to make my pin,
and it was well worth the effort, because it was an otherwise perfect vent
wing window and I didn't want to throw it away. The new pin is also steel,
not pot metal, and should outlive the bus.    Jeff
