Sounds like you found the problem. Valves are exhaust on the ends and  
intakes in the center. E-I-I-E So it looks like you've lost #1 intake  
valve or seat. This is the engine that won't turn over, right? That  
would explain it.  My guess at this point is a "dropped" valve. Might  
have the valve head stuck in the piston. Either way, the motor has to  
come out and the head has to come off.

Sorry.
