alternate method when it happened to me about 200 miles from home, and
since mine is a 78 auto tranny bus it wasn't quite so easy. especially
since my cable broke where it attaches to the side of the tranny for the
kickdown.

pair of needle nose vice grips holding the throttle body and a long wire
from  there thru the hatch to the hand holds above the window all the way
to the front where it attached to the door grab handle. and I had a hand
throttle all the way to where I was going (wouldn't cancel a ski trip I
had already paid for just because of a cable) in Vermont and then Back to
Baltimore.... worked fine, didn't take long to get used to either.
