Short story: Hose from Aux Air Regulator disconnected from S-Tube.

Long Story: I re-read the manual on CSV, TTS and AAR for inspiration
and preparation to test and re-read posts in the Archive on same.
Also some feedback and encouragement from Ken Dunn led me to think
more about fuel starvation v. air starvation. Decided to check
electrical connections to CSV and TTS. The TTS is located under the
left-side air intake manifold and so I had to get down real low to
see what I was doing, and then... as I was looking up into the engine
compartment I saw a loose hose. This is a fairly large hose from the
AAR to a white plastic Y that fits into the side of the S-Tube.
Reconnected and the engine started up and ran normally. Celebration!
In my defense I can only say that as a matter of course I thought I
had checked all hoses, wires etc. when I first started studying the
problem. As a matter of habit, I do this on any problem as I am
staring at the beast and wondering where to start - oh well - at
least Doris is back in the game.
The end of the hose is starting to crack (30 years old) and should
probably be replaced. As it is, I tie-wrapped it on and it is now snug.

Anyone want a good deal on a used Double Relay?
