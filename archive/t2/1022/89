Subject: sealant for pushrod tube seals

Hey Everyone,
I wanted to find out what sealants people recommend for pushrod tube 
seals.  I'm going to be swapping out my leaky ones tonight and my 
mechanic recommends the Permatex Red High Temp RTV Silicone but that 
one's not sensor safe (I have a WB02 sensor).  So, I got the Ultra-Blue 
Sensor Safe RTV Silicone which is good up to 500F intermittent.  Will 
that work ok?

Thanks,
Mike
