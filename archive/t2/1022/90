Mike,

For a type 4 motor. If you clean the galleys and pushrod tubes and make sure
the pushrod tubes are not bent or dented at the ends, all you need is a
little motor oil to slip them into place. You can use a small amount of
aviation gasket sealer, but no silicone is needed. Mine don't leak after
about 10K miles of mixed driving and I didn't use anything at all.

Now if you are referring to a type 1 motor, just a bit of aviation gasket
sealer works great.

Hey Everyone,
I wanted to find out what sealants people recommend for pushrod tube 
seals.  I'm going to be swapping out my leaky ones tonight and my 
mechanic recommends the Permatex Red High Temp RTV Silicone but that 
one's not sensor safe (I have a WB02 sensor).  So, I got the Ultra-Blue 
Sensor Safe RTV Silicone which is good up to 500F intermittent.  Will 
that work ok?

Thanks,
Mike
