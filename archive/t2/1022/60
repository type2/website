Subject: VW Camper Rental in Europe

Hi All,

I'm planning a trip to Europe in June and looking for recommendations on
camper rentals. I would prefer a bus, but it doesn't have to be. A few years
ago I rented one out of Amsterdam, but I plan on being a lot farther south
this time, in Switzerland, France and Italy. I could easily fly into Paris,
Frankfurt, Rome, Zurich, or wherever somebody knows of a good place to rent
from. Any suggestions would be welcomed.

Hope you can help.

Ned
