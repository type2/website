Fade in.

We hear the voice of a radio DJ, coming from a hotel clock radio:

"Okay, campers, rise and shine, and don't forget your booties because  
it's COOOLD out there today"

(Cue Sonny & Cher singing "I Got You Babe",

Fade out to the email message already in progress...



Hi Volks.

Just in case it needed repeating, I am once again reminding the  
hardcore and wanna-be winter westfalia campers about the upcoming  
TCWBC to be held on February 16th at Valens Conservation Area, just  
about an hour west of Toronto, Ontario.

Wiarton Willie says the winter weather will be over in 6 weeks, so if  
you're looking for some cold-weather camping you had better act fast.

FYI, I am starting work with a new employer tomorrow and will be in  
Hartford, CT on training from February 4th through the 15th, so I am  
no longer able to provide the chili dinner for Saturday evening.  
Dinner will now be self-serve. Sunday's FMBC Breakfast Burritos are  
most definitely still on, so be sure to bring an ingredient.

For more information, see the website at www.pottsfamily.ca/ 
The_Bug_Pack/TCWBC or email me off-list.


Happy Trails,
