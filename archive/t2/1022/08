Just a friendly reminder to not reply to an existing email when starting
a new thread.  This breaks threaded email clients.  If you don't know
what I'm talking about that's OK.  Those of us that do would appreciate
it if you started a brand new email thread for a new discussion topic.

TIA and happy bus piloting,
