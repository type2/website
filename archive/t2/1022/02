I'll tell you what you DON'T do.  If you get out of your bus in the
middle of nowhere in an ice storm to clear your windshield do NOT close
your door!  I made this mistake down south of Amarillo, TX many years
ago in my 73 Westy and when I went to get back in I discovered the
squeeze-trigger door handle was completely encased in ice.  All the rest
of my doors were locked (I double checked) and I had nothing to chisel
the ice away with.  I was locked out and getting colder by the second.

The obvious thought of breaking a window came to mind, but seemed a
little drastic (not to mention making the rest of that hellish journey
even colder than it already was).  So, being the fine upstanding
resourceful young man that I was I did the only other thing I could do:
unzipped my fly and peed on the door handle.  Yep - had just enough
go-go juice to do the job.  Wasn't elegant and I'm not proud of it, but
it got me back in without any *real* damage to my bus :)

Cheers.
