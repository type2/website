I think fuel pump bad.  Has to run long enough to get really hot (10 or 15
minutes.)  The fuel keeps it cool enough to run.  Shut it off and it
takes 5 minutes to get the fuel and pump hot enough to freeze up.  10 or
15 minutes later it has cooled off enough to run again.  Happened on my
Ford (pump in fuel tank.)
