Subject: Re: [T2] Arg!! Bad mechanic strikes.

Follow up:

Removed the 2 bolts that holds the shift plate and associated parts in place.

Removed shifter. The little "pin" on the ball end of the shifter has
been totally ovaled. Dig around the spare parts bin, find old shifter
(ah ha, I have actually done some work on this part of the vehicle).
Reinstall old shifter.

Things seem better, a little more back to normal but not perfect. The
shifter has some rotational play, I'm not sure if I remember it being
this bad. The plastic "bushing" (guide sleeve) right near the shift
linkage appears to have tons of play, possibly more than before.

The entire shift rod from the linkage back seems to sloppy rotational
play, is this normal?

I'm hoping I wont have to star looking at the transmission end of this
linkage for problems.

Now might be a good time to dig up the replacement bushings I bought
years back and do an install. Any caveats?

thanks

peace

ps: I'm amazed at the therapeutic value of working on my bus. I'm no
longer fuming, now just annoyed by this bad mechanic. Take type 2 of
these and call me in the morning
