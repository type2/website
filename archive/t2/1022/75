Subject: Re; [T2] VW Camper Rental in Europe

Stan,

Here is the Netherlands division of the company we booked through in Germany this past summer for Bad Camberg.

We rented a 2007 Eurovan camper, Volkswagen's own conversion.  It was a turbo-diesel with a 5-speed manual tranny.  Very nice ride.  I think we paid about $900-1000 USD for 7 or 8 days of rental.

We flew into Frankfurt but there was not a VW camper available there, so we took the train to Dusseldorf and picked one up there and returned it in Frankfurt.  We drove all over Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands in it and slept in it every night.  It is very easy to find campgrounds in Europe.

If you are not firm about going in June, flights are much cheaper in May.  After the 3rd week in May fares triple in price.
