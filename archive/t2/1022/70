I've had an '81 for slightly over two years, and am very happy with it. I 
have done a number of VERY mountainous routes, and other than having to keep 
in the slow lane, have had no problems. I would highly recommend a 
tachometer if there isn't one already. I put one in before my first big 
mountain trip, into the BC Rockies, and would have been nervous driving it 
without the tach feedback. I don't yet have the temp gauges, but have 
frequently checked the dipstick after climbing huge hills, and it has never 
been anywhere near hot. If you're ready to take time to smell the roses, 
.... I think you'll be happy.

My friend Courtney has a '77, and it definitely has more pick up to get 
started, due to its lower weight, but the Vanagon is roomier, and I do  like 
the way it drives. I do not find it as underpowered as some people think, 
especially in town.

Best of luck,
Phil
