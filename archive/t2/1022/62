Subject: Re: [T2] contemplating a 1981 vanagon westfalia - HELP!

The aircooled Vanagons are underpowered, but they're at no more risk
of overheating than a bay window bus.

The biggest question is: What do YOU want with your Vanagon? A bay
will be lighter and a smidge faster than a Vanagon. But a Vanagon is
nicer to ride in and easier to drive, all else being equal.
