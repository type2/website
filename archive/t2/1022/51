Subject: Re: [T2] Arg!! Bad mechanic strikes. 

Jules, et al.,

My bus has no lock-out at all between 2nd and Reverse
and "only I" can get it into either reliably.  Of course,
I use this as an excuse to never lock it, ignoring the
fact that only one of the doors can be unlocked with 
the key (and none of them can be locked with it).

Yes, I do have a regular mechanic.  He can do it, too,
but he is as old as I am and one of these days...
