Peter asked:


 Was just looking at that site again.  It mentions a "SliverFish" edition
Bay Window.  Anyone ever see one of these?

 Did they make a Westfalia version?

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

It was Silverfish or in German: Silberfisch

Not in Westy style.

From the type 2 archives:

"My Search about the Silberfisch came out that about 1600 were made as a
special sales promotion for the last models of the baywindow bus. After the
Silberfisch came the new model: Vanagon

It was only sold in Germany. Other Silberfisches must have been exported
sometime in their roadworthy lifes. So the British one that you linked here
is also German origin. This one is also right hand drive which is not common
in England as they drive on the wrong side of the road all the time.

I found another link to a Silberfisch owner in Germany. It also contains a
short movie in which his bus was used as a tv promotion for a TV Station
RTL2. (Sorry but it is in German language)

The Silberfisch came with:
- chrome bumpers
- tinted windows
- silver metallic paint
- steel sliding roof
- blue velours upholstery
- 70PS engine
- chrome trim at doorhandle height

I cannot confirm if the trip odometer was standard in these buses, but as it
is a special edition it is likely that it was included in the Silberfisch
accessory list."

"Found photos of the Silverfish accidentally while surfing:

http://www.rccimport.co.dot.uk/pages/detail.asp?ProdID=504

Only 700 were made? I wonder if the trip odometer was stock for that limited
edition model..."

* Search the archives at www.type2.com!!!!  This all came up back in Nov
