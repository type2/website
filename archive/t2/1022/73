Subject: Re: [T2] contemplating a 1981 vanagon westfalia - HELP!

Vanagons are much heavier than busses.
I've owned air cooled buses, Vanagons and water cooled Vanagons.   My 
preference to drive is water cooled Vanagon.

You need to be careful with air cooled Vanagons, invest in a CHT 
gauge.   A lot of people destroy their Vanagon air cooled engines 
driving over mountain passes in the summer.   If you really go slow, 
you will be ok.

My advice is to buy a Vanagon 83.5 and up, with a waterboxer 
engine.....unless the air cooled van you are looking at is near 
perfect.  I doubt I will ever buy an air cooled Vanagon again.

Waterboxers have a whole different set of problems (head gaskets, 
cooling system etc), but at least you'll have more power and more 
engine upgrade options (inline VW , Subaru, Ford Zetec, etc)....and 
with Waterboxer Vanagons you have great heat!
