Ned, talk to my friend Donna in Utrecht, just outside of Amsterdam.  I 
doubt if she will rent you one but she will sell you one and then sell 
it for you again.  This worked very well for my family five years ago. 
We were as far south as Sienna, and up to Denmark over 2 wonderful 
months.  Donna's website is here:

If you look at the vehicles page we had no. 10 "Bumblebee".  I am glad 
to see it is looking good and still in service five years later!

Do tell Donna I sent you - she is impeccably honest and helpful and 
solves all the bureaucracy of licenses and insurance for you.  She is an 
American ex-pat too.
