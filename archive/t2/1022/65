Subject: Re: [T2] VW Camper Rental in Europe

Was it a VW from Amsterdam? Last time I did it was 2002 and all I could find
was a Ford, and it wasn't bad, but I would prefer a VW if possible. I had 5
weeks last trip, so taking my time wasn't a problem. This time we will only
have about 2, so I would prefer, if possible, to find somewhere further
south. Any idea if there are big price differences in different countries?
