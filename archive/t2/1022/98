I don't have a number, but I would expect it to be cooler than cylinder
head temps and not much hotter than oil temps.  Maybe in the 300F range?
Anybody ever checked that area with a laser thermometer?  If I still had
a bus I'd have a peek, but doing that on my 914 would involve putting
the backend up in the air and removing a wheel.  And with the snow we've
been getting here in CO I haven't even had the beasty out of the garage
since early December :(
