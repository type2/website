Threaded email readers sort emails by threads.  When you reply to an 
existing email, blank out the subject, and start a new topic it still 
gets grouped with the old topic.  When you compose a new message for a 
new topic it starts a new group.  It just makes for an easier email 
reading experience, especially when you get 500 emails a day.

Shall we move on to top posting now?  Just kidding!

Happy bus piloting,
