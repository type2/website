Subject: Arg!! Bad mechanic strikes.

Hi,

Just picked up my bus from it's yearly safety inspection. Passed with no issues.

The mechanic mentioned he had trouble getting it into reverse, this
should have tipped me off right away.

When I first got in my knee hit the shifter, hey wait, its not
supposed to be all the way over here.... what's going on?

Well it seems the guy must have brute forced the shifter to get it
into reverse. I'm fuming!! Whats the most likely point of failure
here? It's cold and dark and I'm too tired to go out and see what he's
done... sigh..

At least I can take solace in the fact that I can't be the first
person who this has happened to...

How would you approach a mechanic in such a situation to get the
problem resolved? I'm sure not going to let him monkey around with my
ride anymore.

peace
