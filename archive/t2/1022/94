Yes - clean and smooth is the main thing.  Use a scrungy-pad (sorry - is
there a better name for those green kithen abrasive pads?) to get the
grooves shiny clean.

I have used *Dow Corning high vacuum grease* for pushrod tube seals for
20 years and have never had one leak.  If you ever take them apart
you'll find the grease still in place and doing its job nicely.  The
stuff has the consistancy of thick vasolene, but has a service
temperature range from -40F up to 400F.  Not the cheapest stuff, but it
hasn't failed me yet and a little bit goes a long way.  One engine had
50K miles before I retired it, 1 had 25K miles before I sold the bus,
and my 914 has about 55K since the last top-end tear-down and no leaks
at the tubes.
