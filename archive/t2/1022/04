Subject: Re: [T2] Stub axels?

Hi Ian,

All manual transmission axles are the same, from 68-79. Auto-tranny  
axels are of different lengths. I've personally swapped axles between  
transmissions and had never had any problems with it. My westfakia is  
sporting 1979 axles bolted to a 1970 transmission and it works fine.

Happy Trails,
