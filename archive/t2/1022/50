You want "therapeutic value" - you'll get it in the
shift rod bushing replacement job! I decided that the
next time I have a bus that needs shift rod bushings
it's going up for sale! 

Seriously - Mayhaps you should have used the original
shift lever and just swapped out the spring-loaded
pin?  I had three to make one a year or so ago and
ended up with two of them being really loose although
they did not appear to be worn. The front rod bushing
will make it seem new again. I always safety wire a
spare right beside it so I don't get stuck without
one. My bus went through them at an alarming rate  -
at least 2 per year. Seems to be working better with
the new transaxle and engine, so there must have been
a misalignment before. -BaH
