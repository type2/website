Subject: Re: [T2] Arg!! Bad mechanic strikes.

To follow up, nothing actually seems broken.. yet. I was able to drive
home, shift through all the gears, and even put it in reverse just
fine. It just seems like the shifter isn't where it used to be. It's
much closer to the drivers seat, and further toward the rear. In
reverse the shifter is practically hitting the driver's seat.

Until I have daylight I won't know for sure, event then it might be
hard to tell visually. Something seems like it may have become bent or
is no longer coupling correctly. This will be my first dive into the
mechanics of the shifter and associated linkages in a bus.

This guy runs a small shop, I've never actually gone to him for
mechanical work as I do my own, but I did notice another bus in the
lot in the past, which is what brought me to him for an inspection two
or three years ago. The first question I asked him was, "do you know
how to put this bus in reverse" and I proceeded to let him explain the
process. I was sufficiently satisfied (though still horrified) enough
to leave my bus with him. All my previous year's dealing with getting
inspections from this gent have been trouble free.

I know he didn't mean me any wrong, he must have been having a
genuinely difficult time finding reverse.... still brute force on a
shifter in any vehicle seems like a bad idea, I would expect more from
someone who spends all day around other people's cars.

I'll spend some time tomorrow to determine the damage, then go see
what he has to say on Monday hopefully he'll be reasonable.

off, to the bentley
