Subject: Re: [T2] Stub axels?

Thanks Greg You are correct , but I was asking about the Stub axel , what
the CV bolts to on the wheel side;)


 All manual transmission axles are the same, from 68-79. Auto-tranny
 axels are of different lengths. I've personally swapped axles between
transmissions and had never had any problems with it. My westfakia is
sporting 1979 axles bolted to a 1970 transmission and it works fine.
