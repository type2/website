Subject: "JEEZ", our rides are old!!

Had a 'firefight" with a local 'less than Menza", parts person today, I was
already frustrated, and as I walked out the door of the place, the relevance
of what I took for granted, and 'they", did not know.... hit me!  My ride is
34 years old!  Went to the local coffee shop, and bought the biggest sweet,
"banger" coffee, and took it back to the person behind the counter, and
through a discourse,..appologized.  He smiled, helped me out a whole lot, and
I went home feeling better for info got.  Sometimes it is hard to keep
perspective!  Must be the garage isolation "think"! But... they had some old
'offlist' stuff, that I can get cheap for my Westy, and could have 'walked"
past the opportunity!
