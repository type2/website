The "professionals" usually use hardwood chips to
smoke meat with. Usually kill the meat first, too, but
that may happen if you stuff rags in there!

You may be getting exhaust or you may be getting oil
fumes. As a precaution, you could pick up one of those
CO indicators. They are cards available from many auto
parts stores (especially those with a lot of
commercial accounts) and they turn color when CO is
present.

Check the seal on the rear hatch. You could also be
sucking exhaust in there.

The heat exchangers are supposed to have flow-through
all the time. The "valves" direct that flow either
outward or into the heater system. 78's & 79's
actually had venting lines out the back that looked
like exhaust pipes that were louvered to help draw the
hot air out if it wasn't routed to the heater. It
isn't a good idea to just leave 'em open either as the
air cooling the engine will go to the point of least
resistance and so the heater system needs to be intact
or you actually lose cooling pressure.

If the sheetmetal around the heat exchanger has holes,
it is less likely to draw in exhaust or fumes than it
is to be blowing valuable cooling air out. They are
under pressure while the engine is running, more at
higher rpm. Fumes can be drawn into the fan, however,
and pushed through the heater system. Usually engines
that have had oil leaks are going to take a while to
burn off that oil film and meanwhile, smoky heat. -BaH
