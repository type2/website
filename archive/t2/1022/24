Subject: Email Systems (Was Stub axels)

Gmail and some others group emails by subject line. If two or more
separate discussions happen under the same subject line it becomes
difficult to keep track.

If you're interested in trying Gmail, let me know. I "only" have 94
invites left. ;)

Bus content: I'm off to troubleshoot a fuel delivery problem on the
Guac. Hopefully it will need just a filter.
