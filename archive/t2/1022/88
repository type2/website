Subject: Re: [T2] contemplating a 1981 vanagon westfalia - HELP!

I have one of these, A 80 westy with the 2.0L
aircooled engine in it, and I had to learn how to
drive it, When I first got it I overhauled the engine,
with less than 500 miles on the engine(oil temp went
above 260) I sunk a valve going up a hill.(only had
oil temp gage), took my spare engine and put in itnext
time my son was using it and the oil temp went high
again, this time gauling the pistons on 3 & 4. After
two engines I got a Cyl head temp plus putting a
external oil cooler on, this kept the oil temp down
but the head temp was a controling factor, put water
injection on it, to be able to run 60-65 keeping the
head temp within limits. It's a good engine but if you
don't keep a close watch on it, you can have a lot of
problems with it. After learning how to drive it, I
have put around 58,000 miles on the third engine. Phil
