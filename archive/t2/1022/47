Subject: Re: [T2] Troubleshooting Day (temp sensor II bypass)

So you have none at hand? Did you check its resistance?  You can even 
put a resistor in series to ground to bypass it to test engine at your 
temperature.  In my electrical box I keep a variable resistor (pot) 
that'll doo 200 to 12K at least. 2-3K at 68 deg F (test at sensor tip 
wire to ground) and should be same at ECU erminal 13 to 17 (ground).  If 
it's really cold out, it may be 12 k, if hot engine, 250-400 ohms.  If 
the wiring has a discontinuity or there is corrosion in the sensor 
threads, high resistyance makes it run rich to not at all.

  I thought I had another TSII around, but I don't. LeSigh.

  I'm going to see if I can find one locally, if not I'll order one.
