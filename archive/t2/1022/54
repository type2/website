Subject: Fwd: Can I Disconnect the Heater Box?

Well I spent my first full morning under my new bus today.  I replaced all of the fuel hoses per
everyones suggestions.  The one running between the filter and the tank was fraying a bit and was
actually cracked where it connected to the tank.  If it still leaks when I fill her up I guess
that'll mean its the pump or the tank itself.  Hopefully its fixed ... I'll keep a close watch on
it.

While I was under there I found a possible source of the exhaust fumes inside the bus.  The right
heat exchanger is punctured in a couple of places and that coupled with the broken tail pipe and
the oil dripping on the heat box, I think the fumes are being sucked in and sent up front.

Can I disconnect just the right box?  Or maybe shove some rags up the tube just before it joins
with the left tube, in front of the "control" piece ... that way I'd have the left box providing
at least some heat.  

Thanks,
Steve
