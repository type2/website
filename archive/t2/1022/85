If you are a patient person, the vanagon will serve you fine.  If you are
the sort who chafes at cars passing you you won't like it at all.

The engine is a type IV, tough as nails if maintained properly.  Others
have pointed out the need to monitor CHT or oil temp, but I've found that
if you avoid the worst case of continuous WOT or sustained high speed you
really don't have a worry.  With my bay, I never run more than 3/4
throttle on hills and keep speeds down to 60 on the flat.  With a vanagon
you could probably run a bit faster, but 65 would be a good max cruise
speed.

You will, of course, have to get used to listening to people's "I had one
of those back when..." stories at just about every gas stop...
