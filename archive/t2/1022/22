Subject: RE: [T2] Preemptive Airs check...

I'm about 10 miles from exit 33 on I95 in SC (26 intersects at exit 86 I
think) and I'm theroetically off work from the 11th to the 15th.  I can
generally access a rollback and lifts from my old part-time.  If you need a
spot to plotz let me know and I will try and make arrangements.  Make sure you
have a good spare, some fix a flat, spare fuel and oil, ect.  Edisto Freeze
yer Toe is the week-end of the 22nd or thereabouts, don't know if you can work
that into your plans though.JT Beaufort, SCRunning: 1. 62 404.1 Kompressor 2.
