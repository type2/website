Hey Jules sorry to here....I have two 1971"s and I
drive in Seattle area.....I think he either bent your
shifter or possibly broke the "shift coupler"where it
connects to trans.....You may be able to remove
shifter and re-adjust or (harder to do ) crawl under
and look at shift coupling while someone else tries to
put in gear....If shift rod moves but not the trans
end... the spot weld on coupler broke....you can
replace with-out R & R Engine and Trans...But it is
tight...Be sure to safety wire square head nut....post
more info....I had the same problem on the
westy......po's Wrench did me the same favor.....Tony
