You didn't mention checking for vacuum leaks at all the inputs to the 
intake plenum......all those hoses and valves and devices that might affect 
the mixture stream past the AFM and the "S" boot.  The strong gasoline odor 
suggests mixture being too rich, resulting in mis-fire at operating 
temp.  Is your cold-start system supplying fuel past the time when it 
should have turned off?

Built up over time. Started out occasional misfire only at highway
speeds when I goosed the throttle. Degraded into misfiring as soon as
the bus is warm. Got to the point where when I got off the freeway it
wouldn't idle or even let me keep it idling with the throttle. Had to
wait 2-3 minutes before it would start again. During cranking I would
get a strong odor of gasoline.  ....snip......
