I will have to consider this hard for the EJ22T swap I am getting ready to
start. Seems I have found the donor, and decided on cooling, and jsut need to
locate a garage for rent (which i think I already have lined that up
too)."What signify a few lives lost in a century or two? The treeof liberty
must be refreshed from time to time with the blood ofpatriots and tyrants. It
is its natural manure."-- Thomas Jefferson (letter to William Stephens Smith,
1787)
