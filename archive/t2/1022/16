Subject: Bosch D-Jetronic troubleshooting(Friday)

I am having a problem with the Bosch D-Jetronic on my car and have a strange problem, it is a 1975 Volvo 164E, sorry, but I don't have access to a smarter group of people than on this list, seriously, and it isn't a lot different than the K-Jetronic on my bus, reply off list unless you think the reply can benefit everybody.

Engine is cold, car starts and runs fine.

Engine is hot, car starts and runs fine.

Engine is in between, car won't start, fires but won't run (similar to a faulty starter solenoid except in this case it has nothing to do with the position of the key).

So I can go back and forth to work and school but if I run in to the store for 20 minutes I can't start my car.

I have to park it for either 5 minutes or an hour.

Has anybody else experienced this with Jetronic Bosch fuel injection?

Thanks,

James in Portland, Oregon
