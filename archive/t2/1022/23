Sorry Dan and list members!  didn't mean to sound like a jerk, but I really
don't understand about the threaded e-mails?  Is this as simple as start a new
e-mail for new topic and only reply to existing topic?  I am probably over
thinking this, but wanted to make sure I replied not only corrrectly,  but
more politley too!  Bless the Bus People!!.
