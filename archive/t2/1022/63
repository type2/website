Subject: RE: [T2] contemplating a 1981 vanagon westfalia - HELP!

I had an 82 for awhile. They really are well built. It's a type 4 but the
configuration is a bit different and you only access from the top and you open
the license plate door to check the oil and time it.

They are beefy and heavy and handle ok. Few of them are really rusted out like
bays can get.  Although it's not quick the tranny ratios seem to support
freeway driving much better than my 71s but not sure if the late bays are the
same or not. You can keep speed on the flats but plan to get bored when you
hit a nice hill.

I'd say the biggest advantage is safety - they are tanks. I rented an 84 in
Hawaii - you really can feel the power of the water cooled engine.
