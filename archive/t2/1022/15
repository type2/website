Subject: 8th Annual VW Buses n Boats camping Event- Near Cincinnati,

Howdy Y'all,

The Ohio Valley Tribe of the Full Mon Bus Club would
like to invite you out to our 8th Annual VW Buses 'n
Boats camping and canoeing event this May 16-18, 2008
in Morrow, Ohio (near Cincinnati).

We will be camping right on the banks of the
Nationally Dedicated Scenic Little Miami River, and I
do mean RIGHT on the banks.  The campground is
secluded and beautiful.  The weekend will feature VW
bus camping, a 6 mile canoe trip on the scenic Little
Miami RIver (optional), a "Cincinnati Style" chili
dinner on Saturday evening.  Of course there will be
live music picking and singing the hole weekend, world
famous Full Moon Bus Club breakfast burritos, and
fires, big fires, REALLY big fires (after all, we are
the only VW bus club that brings at least 4 firemen to
every campout!!!! Really, it's true!).  Of course, the
Buses n Boats Bash is family friendly (at least BEFORE
10:00 pm) so bring the kids and the dogs for a great
weekend filled with Mid-western hospitality.  Here's
the link with MUCH more info and pix from the past:

Hope to see you there!

PEACE!
