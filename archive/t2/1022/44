Hi Jules,

This is a sign of problems at the coupler located between  
transmission and linkage.  Luckily, it's a widely available $10 part,  
seeing as how it's common to the aircooled beetle.  Before I install  
one I usually add tack welds between the arms and the collar; the  
press fit technique used in manufacturing leaves something to be  
desired.

Happy Trails,
