Subject: CHT sender help?

Hi, I have just done the procedure for mounting my CHT spark plug sender
(VDO), and am trying to figure out how to route the other end of the sender,
(the rectangular plug), through the cooling tin, since I don't think You can
cut that stiff wire and reconnect on the other side of the tin.  Can anyone
offer a suggestion to this?  Thanks.
