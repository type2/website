Subject: [T2] VW Camper Rental in Europe

I haven't rented a van in Europe for years, got the last one in Amsterdam
where I flew into.  Don't worry about renting and then driving "long"
distances, first, the autobahns are awesome if you just want to get
somewhere, second, there's nowhere in Europe you can't drive to in a very
short time.  It took us less than a day to drive from Italy up all the way
to Amsterdam.
