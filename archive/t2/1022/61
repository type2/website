Subject: contemplating a 1981 vanagon westfalia - HELP!

Greetings...
 
I'm contemplating purchasing a 1981 Vanagon Westfalia, my first venture
into the vanagon world.  I live in Colorado and plan to do a lot of
camping up in the mountains, driving over mountain passes.  The 1981 has
a 67 hp power plant.  The vanagon is all original, pristine inside and
very clean outside, except for oxidation of the paint.  I have too kids
and take along a lot of gear.  Am I insane for considering this vehicle
given the small engine?  I have no problem going slow, but I'm still
concerned about overheating and damage to the engine.
 
I'm looking at the vanagon tomorrow and would like some input before I
take the plunge.  Could anyone offer some advice?  Should I or should I
not?
 
Thanks much.
