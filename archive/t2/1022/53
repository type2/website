Another reminder that we are driving vehicles with some quirks that can be
damaging if not understood by the driver.  Valet parking, inspectors, etc.
are not a good idea if you can avoid them.

Our buses are halfway between the Model T (what's that middle pedal for?)
and the present.  There are many people out there who haven't driven a
stick, let alone one that requires a push downward to engage reverse!
