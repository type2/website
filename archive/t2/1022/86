Subject: Child's hammock with vanagon seats??

Does anyone have vanagon seats in their Bay?? I'm wondering if a childs
hammock will still fit with them installed? I have the later vanagon captains
chairs with armrests in my 77 Westy, but am thinking about getting the child's
hammock to fit across the front.
