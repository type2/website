Subject: Front Brakes Question, how to distinguish '71-'72 calipers from

Long story,

I let a mechanic prepare my '72 for state inspection-last year.  Ball joints
were needed.  Now, getting ready for inspection again, I discover that he
replaced my nearly brand new '72 rotors with crappy ones, my rebuilt
calipers with worn out old ones, and all my new german wheel bearings that I
install have morphed into worn out chineze bearings.  I was not told about
any of this.  No hint of this major switch-er-roo is apparent in my bill.

I suspect that I now have '73 + steering knuckles, spindles, brakes, etc.
etc.

The good:  I have a situation where replacements are more available and less
expensive.
The good: I have better brakes.

The bad:  All my work has been replaced with garbage.
The bad: I have to repeat everything I did 1.5 years ago.
The bad: I just suffered for 1 month tracking down all the parts that I
needed to fix everything back for my '72 brakes, except, guess what, nothing
works.

Now, I am at the mercy of the kindness of our vendors to let me exchange
everything and more waiting.  Wish me luck.

Now, I want to be sure.  What kind of brakes do I have?  How can I tell for
sure.  The pictures in Bentley, section 8 page 15 seems indicate that I have
'73+ calipers, no dimensions, though.  Does anyone have a way to tell for
sure.

Many Thanks,

Bob H.
