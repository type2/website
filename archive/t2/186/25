I had some trouble getting my pads in.  Use a piece of wood and leverage
against the caliper to push the pistons way back.  You should be able to get
both pads in.  The hard part now is getting the backing plates in but I can
tell you with new pads and a new rotor it will all fit but be tight.  Brakes
work great now.
