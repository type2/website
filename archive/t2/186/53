Mike,
1. you remove the air flow meter
2. you insert a tube from the MAP sensor (mounted in the MS box)  to a 
place on your intake plenum
3. You need to fit a throttle position sensor (TPS) to your throttle body 
(TB).  This might be easier to do by getting a TB with a TPS in the 
junkyard that would fit to your plenum.
4. Don't forget the crank sensor (I forget what MS is using for this)

The air pressure sensor comes in the kit if you buy the parts kit in the 
group buy.  Otherwise, digikey stocks them.

I'm currently running CIS - 2L hydraulic, stuck into a '60 Double cab.
Planning on building up another engine with a turbo and using megasquirt.
