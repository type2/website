Subject: Re: [T2] what distributor to use?


Crane (used to be Allison)makes an electronic ignition that comes with an 
optical trigger that replaces your points.  I am using this setup right now, 
and have for about 5 years.  It has never failed, and is in the 205t stock 
dist.  The CDI unit cost me about $85 back then.  Worth every penny.
