Subject: TR: [T2] what distributor to use?


well, the only choice in my advice is the Mallory with Vacuum Advance that
aircooled.net sells.... the triggering is optical with the mallory system
call unilite, better than magnetic pickup as pertronix in my opinion.

look it here:

but be ready to pay some money for this mallory

Vacumm advance are not so bad with a Pertronix inside, actually thats my
config, ive throw away my 009... im using a dual vacuum (DVDA) distributor
(205 J) in my 1700 engine, and actually  because my 1700 is out ive put a
small type 1 engine (1600) temporary and again i did swap the distributor,
so my 205 J DVDA is on my type 1 engine and is really doin a good job(retard
unplugged)

And yes, you can choose 2 type of electronic ignition, one for the vacumm
advance and one for the mecanichal (as the 009)
