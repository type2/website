Jack and Ben,
    The offical service manual was not Chilton or Haynes but by Robert
Bentely.  That's the one you want, and the best part is that it's still
available.  As a profesional mechanic (aircraft) I much prefer the Bentely
manual over the Haynes or the Idiot's Guide, and I have them all.  Each has
their own strength and weakness, I like the Bentely best
