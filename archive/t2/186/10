Subject: troubling signs (update)

This just keeps getting better and better...

Last night I was finally able to remove the rest
of those pesky sheet metal retaining screws (impact
wrench and vise grips.)  Upon removal of the head I
found the culprit.  Apparently the #1 exhaust valve
guide failed and entered the cylinder and was eaten
for lunch by the piston and head.  The surfaces of the
head and piston both have a gold colored metal beaten
in/onto them, must be pretty soft metal as it seems to
want to chip-off with a screwdriver.  The cylinder walls
do not appear to be scored, nor do I feel any grooves when
I run my fingers across it, but I don't have a mic to measure
with.  As for the head, the valve area of the head looks=20
OK, the pounded valve guide material was beaten into the
lower surface, not apparently into the valves.  Think this
could be fixed?  Is my piston salvagable?

Does this mean that the entire engine (78 2.0 FI) needs to be rebuilt?

It looks like that I could buy an AVP rebuild cheaper
than I could build my own, is it possible to "patch" this one
back together until I have the $$ for the AVP? or am I just
asking for more heartache?

Another option is, I have a complete 1700 w/single Weber
with a purported broken crank, and another 1700 used longblock
(worked when last ran, no rings.)  I think I could take these
2 engines and make 1 pretty cheaply, maybe that will last me
until I can afford the AVP.

Thanks,

Rob
