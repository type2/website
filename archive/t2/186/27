Subject: locked in place

I would think that the problem is in the linkage and latch assemble, not in 
the handle lock.  You'll probably find that the button is difficult to move 
walso when trying to actuate the lock from inside the van.  This is a 
frequent occurence (it's happened to my '79, and the locks on it are fine).  
The solution is to remove the door panel, and clean and lubricate 
everything.  WD40 will work to clean it up with, and I'd use a spray white 
lithium grease to lubricate everything.  The mechanism is pretty easy to 
understand onece you see it.  I rekey the locks and rebuild them, and 
perform any other service they may need, but I really don't think that's 
going to do you any good.  Take a look at the mechanism after the handle.
