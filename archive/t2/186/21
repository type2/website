Subject: Re: [T2] new brake pads won't go in

It would help if you gave the year of your bus.....

I am assuming you have a 71 or 72?

Sounds like they gave you 73-79 pads which are thicker. Screw-ups like this
happen, but usually the other way around. They put thin 71/72 pads in 73+
parts boxes.
Take them back and get the correct pads.
