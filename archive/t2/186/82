In your picture, are you identifying the black box as 211 035 257?
According to a ETKA parts search for that part # I get Suppression 
condenser for ignition coil "deleted part. There is no replacement part. 
Deleted 8/91"
I do not find that item in any wiring diagram for 68 thru 79.  If that 
is what the black item is, looks like it can be removed and just run a 
line to the condenser on the dist.
