Subject: no spark== fixed :)



Thanks to everyone that has helped,  the problem ended up being a short in 
the points, there is a crack in part of the plastic that i believe is 
letting the juice spark at.  And i had a fried wire going to the alternator. 
  Again thanks everyone


Also is anyone going to bonnaroo from the indiana/michigan area.  i am 
headed out tomarrow morning and was wondering if anyone else was going.
