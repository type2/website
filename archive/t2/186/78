Good idea re the electronic ignition...but there is no better distributor
for the type4 engine than a vac.advance.Don't go for a 009 just because
it is available and some clown tells you it's the go for your engine.
009s suck in type4 engines...they just can't provide enough advance
when it is really needed...BTDT (thru no choice at the time)and never 
would again!!!

 Stick with what you got if it is working OK,have it repaired or go
 find a good used vac adv dizzy.From memory,the correct one for an
 1800 eng (I am presuming this since it's a 74) should have at the end
 of it's identification number,205P...unless you're in California
 where it's prolly something wierd that the rest of us didn't have
 to worry about ;) <G>
 Confirm first however...it could be different where you are as I
 am on the other side of the planet...(funny,that's what my wife says
 too...;) and the US spec for 74 could be different from what we have
 in Oz.

 Someone on the list (sorry can't remember who) has a website with
 all the correct distributors for every Nth American model listed.
 Might be worth investigating...anybody know the url to which I am
 referring?
