Update on an old list message...

I found the number tucked away on my distributor and it's standard:

VW 021-905-205P, Bosch 0231 168 005

I still can't figure out what the black box is that I identified below or
why the 271 condenser was there in the first place.

What was unusual was that instead of connecting the green wire directly to
the coil, it connected to a black box that is inline with terminal 1 on the
coil. 211 035 257.

Can someone help me identify the two item in this picture that might lead to
identifying the correct condenser.
