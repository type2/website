Subject: Re: [T2] Bosch FI internals

Thanks Dave

I am trying to learn the details of the VW FI system not to improve it but 
to make sure it is working to spec. I am interested in developing a hot mock 
up that will test the AFS as well as the ECU. I have bought some surplus 
ebay electronic equipment (oscilloscopes, voltmeters, pulse generator and a 
xy recorder). I have spent a lot of time restoring the equipment to working 
condition.

I cut up and parted out a 77 bus and have all the FI system including the 
wiring harness. I will come as close as I can to simulating a working system 
for test purposes.

As an example, if a sick ECU is missing some pulses and causing a lean 
condition it would show up in the setup I am shooting for. Injector  pulse 
width variation with sensor changes could also be observed on a scope and 
the output of the AFS vs air flow could be mapped on the recorder.
