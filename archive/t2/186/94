Bentley is good. Muir is good but will not s satisfy you b/c you have 
mechanical experience.

There are two good books on Bosch - one is how each basic system works, and 
the other how to tune and modify Bosch fuel injection. Both are worthwhile 
though neither are specifically service manuals.

You can find these by going to the  Barnes and Noble website and searching 
for Bosch Fuel Injection. The books of which I speak are #1 and #4. Looks 
like some more good books though there too.

1st Bentley, second the Bosch Fuel Injection books.
