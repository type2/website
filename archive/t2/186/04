Subject: Re: [T2] Heat Without Heater Boxes?/Conversions

I have researched these heaters.  I am familiar with how they work as well
as similar heaters' somewhat troublesome applications in other vehicles,
especially airplanes.  Remember the guy whose heater caught fire and started
some good old magnesium parts to burning?  He didn't make it.  As a matter
of fact, we don't have a furnace in our house (and no, we don't live in
Florida) but that's beside the point.  And, I hardly think that being better
than a Stewart-Warner is saying much.  Greg, the pieces that flow past the
tank are two ducts made of sheet metal and joined with a couple of sheet
metal screws. They are not poorly made but they are plenty thin and barely
held together in the best case.  If you are putting your faith in all those
antique safety switches and such then it is misplaced.  We did in fact get
CO poisoning from mine.  Luckily there was some other "byproduct of
combustion" coming through that we could just barely smell, a sort of hot
bitter gasoline smell.  I could also mention the fact that the thing is not
even designed for proper fresh intake of air which is to be heated.  Driving
it this past March was a real snoozer.  The heater was then replaced with
another as I thought I could be confident in it if it seemed to be working
right.  I'd bet that not 1 in 100 of these heaters in America is properly
tested.  I'd also expect that nobody who designed them was figuring on a
lifespan of 3 or 4 decades.  Glen Ward
