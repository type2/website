If the bus is handling OK now, leave it as is.  There probably isn't
enough difference to cause a problem.

However, you don't want the floppy tires on the back if you have a
choice.

Consider what happens when the bus gets a side load.
the floppy tires give a bit more than the others.  If the floppy tires are
on the back, the bus will tend to turn opposite the direction of the
force.  You will steer the other way to keep the bus straight, but now the
force goes the other way, so the bus will turn a bit too much and you'll
have to correct again.

I made this mistake before a 400 mile trip up the Owens Valley (crosswind
heaven).  I had 8 long hours of wrestling at the wheel to wonder why the
bus was suddenly darting back and forth with a mind of its own.  I swapped
the fronts and backs and the problem went away.

A new tire is suspect until you run it for a while, so the old time wisdom
is to put new tires where they can do the least harm, on the rear axle.
Modern tires are much more reliable, so I put the new ones on the front,
only on the theory that most flats are in the rear and if I am going to
shred a tire I'd rather it be the most-worn one.
