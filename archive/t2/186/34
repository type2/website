Subject: Rainbow Wagon Diagnosis.....

Hi Class..
like i said in my last post, we were finally able to get our 'Rainbow 
Wagon' to IA from Yankton S.D, where she 'gave up the ghost' as i've 
learned its put. 
after gettin her home, i was able to craw under her and make a quick 
check on the axle/C.Vs, like i was adviced to look into. 
and what i saw, with her in gear, was that my passenger side axle was 
spinnin around and around and around and around....and bussie just 
sat there like before. 
so....i guess what i was seeing is that our CV is busted.?.? right? 
i didn't take the time to pull off the hub cap, and observe the drum 
at all. (we're in a BIG hurry, with movin and gettin ourselves to the 
gathering right now.) But i was just glad to see that the tranny was 
still workin. 
the CV that was spinnin, is connected to the wheel and not the 
tranny. so is my diagnosis that i'm in need of a new CV, or do i need 
to investigate furthur, when i get back home, and pull my cap to look 
at the drum and axle stub also? 
thanks again...family...for all the help and positive vibes that u've 
sent our way. i just wish i had a gr8t source like this for 
everything else in my life;) sendin much love out to u and yours, 
 from me and mine. peace and gouda vibes, -Chris (70'Westie)

Headin up to the gathering, and then onto Cheese Tour!!! waaahooo..!!
