Subject: GEN Light On, forever!

OK, installed a new Bosch alternator in the parking lot near the airport,
new belt, etc.  GEN light won't go out!!!!  Disconnect battery, engine dies.
OK, battery is new, let's get it home.  After holding my breath for the
quick jaunt home, stopping 1/2 way to check the belt again, got it in the
garage.

There were only 3 connections on the alternator before:  Coil (+ Side),
Eyelet from batt, and another wire behind that (?).  Same connections, dunno
what else to try.  Any suggestions?  Is there something magical that has to
happen to a new alternator to make it work?

A great big thanks goes out to Mesa West in Costa Mesa for removing the fan,
etc from the old alternator, and re-installing it on my new one.  Norm made
sure I had a new belt, shims, new nut, and some advice on belt tightness.
Great bunch of guys.

Details, type 1 motor, dual carbs, etc.  stock electrical, bus is a '70
transporter.

Thanks,

Simon
