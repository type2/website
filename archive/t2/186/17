95% chance all it needs is to remove the latch, clean it and lube it. Mine 
was exactly as you describe before I did so and now works smooth as new.

Remove the door liner and roll up the window. Loosen the botoom of the rear 
window rail. Disconnect the latch rod going to the interior handle. Remove 
the exterior handle. Remove the latch screws. Turn the latch down to closed 
lock by hand. Now it will take a good deal of trial and error to find the 
proper twist and turn for removal. Hose is down with solvent and brush 
until all the crud is out. Dry it then lube with oil or moly grease while 
working manually the various mechanical parts. Put it all back together. 
Putting it back in place in the door can be a real challenge. It will go 
but must be oriented just right and can be very challenging, but know it 
will go back in there. Flush the lock cylinder with solvent, then dry, then 
spray lube or light oil. Graphited lock fluid ist beste.
