It sounds like the junkyard bus has an EGR box.  Not positive because I
don't have one, but it's sole purpose could be to turn on a warning light
reminder to check the EGR system after 15,000 miles have gone by and that's
all.  If you don't have one, don't worry about it.

If the cable isn't turning you could check the left from wheel hub to see if
the cable is attached to the dust cover in the hub.  On mine, there should
be a little silicone nipple and underneath is a cable poking through a
square opening in the hub and it is held in place by a circlip.  If it's not
attached there it's not going to spin.  Have more silicone available to
reaffix everything.

Otherwise, the cable may be broken in the middle somwehere because of wear
due to over-bending, no lube, etc.
