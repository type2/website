Subject: what distributor to use?



in my 1974 bus i want to put in an electronic ignition kit to replace the 
points and install a better distributor than the vacume advance.  does 
anyone have a recommendation for which distributor to get.


Also can you use an electronic ignition set on the original vacume advance 
distributor?
