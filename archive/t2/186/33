I bought a '76 Westy in April, and I'm having problems with both the driver's 
side and passenger side door handles - I can lock them using my keys, but 
then they don't want to unlock with the key (thank heaven for the side 
slider)... 

The driver's side door handle puts up more resistance (it's a brand new one 
from GoWesty that I put in over the weekend because the old one had lost a 
part and wouldn't let me open the door from the outside when it was locked) - 
I know the keys are good because I tested the two keys that came with it 
along with two copies before I put it on.  Also, to unlock it from the inside 
now I have to apply pressure on the inside door latch handle while 
simultaneously lifting on the button - 

I'm afraid to use the key on either door for fear of breaking a key off...  
I've tried using some WD 40 to loosen things up, but it doesn't seem to have 
helped...

Does anyone have any ideas/suggestions?
