Subject: Re: [T2] Variation on Locked in Place

Mine latch mechanism was full of dirt and dust and lint when I took it out 
to clean. I soaked it in turpentine/kerosene/mineral spirts and squirted it 
with carb cleaner until it was clean. Then I regreased it. Now it unlocks 
and locks like it was new.

Zero cost fix.

Ciao!
