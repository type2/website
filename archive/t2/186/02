Sorry to take up list space with this,
but,
I remember someone was selling bus jacks not too long ago.
Do you have any left?  How much are they?

I have a vw jack, but it is definetely not for a bus.  It has a round tub=
e.  I don't know how to tell what it is for.  But, anyone need it?  Wanna=
 trade for a bus jack?

Thanks,
Kyle
