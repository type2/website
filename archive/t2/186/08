Subject: RE: speedo cable

Hi.

Question:  "are there two Speedometer cables (one from the speedometer to 
the small box then to the wheel) or just one that goes straight to the 
wheel. thanks:"

Answer:  YES!!  Both conditions are possible.

I recommend that you replace your 2 cables + speedo box with ONE cable.

But the important advice I want to pass to you is to check out the 
www.busdepot.com site.  There you can see the single cable, and you can get 
a lot of info by scanning the parts and part numbers.

BTW, my speed box is starting to squeal during the cold/frozen season.  It 
is truly annoying.  This is why I recommend that you replace the 3 piece 
unit with one cable.

I recently found a single speedo cable from a junker, and thought I found 
the holy grail!!  Little did I know that Ron Salmon (my pastor's name is Lon 
Salmon.  Hope they are not related!!) has them for about $10.
