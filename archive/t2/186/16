Subject: Re: [T2] locked in place


I believe the tumbler is fine. Your problem is in the lock assembly itself.
Spraying any penetrant like Liquid Wrench in it/on it to free it up is hit and
miss at best with the lock assembly in the door. If you have tools, your best
fix is to remove the lock assembly and give it a thorough cleaning and then
lube it to get all the pieces in it moving easily. Makes the world of
difference and saves your key!

The lock on my driver's side door is beginnning to stick.  When you turn the
key it doesn't quite push the knob all the way up on the first try always.  I
can get it open, but it takes a couple tries and feels like the key is gonna
snap.  I really don't want to end up with different keys for each door and the
ignition.
Is their anything I can do about this?  Does the lock need to be rekeyed?  I
am looking to correct this as inexpensively as possible, but I would also like
to know the correct way to fix it even if it isn't the cheapest.
Thanks,
