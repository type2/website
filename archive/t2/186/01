The lock on my driver's side door is beginnning to stick.  When you turn =
the key it doesn't quite push the knob all the way up on the first try al=
ways.  I can get it open, but it takes a couple tries and feels like the =
key is gonna snap.  I really don't want to end up with different keys for=
 each door and the ignition.
Is their anything I can do about this?  Does the lock need to be rekeyed?=
  I am looking to correct this as inexpensively as possible, but I would =
also like to know the correct way to fix it even if it isn't the cheapest=
.
Thanks,
