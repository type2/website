Subject: Re: [T2] dashboard lights

On my '78 the dashboard lighting is powered by one one wire coming off of 
the headlight switch. It is a grey wire with a red stripe I believe.

Do you have the knob twisted so that it dims the lights?

Is this wire connected?

The wire is 12v+ and the base of the lights is 12v-. The switch is the 
source and the metal backing on the speedo is the ground.

Ciao!
