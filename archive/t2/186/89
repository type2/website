---May be off base but I would make sure everything is
turned off and check for a current draw. If you dont
have a meter then you can pull the ground cable and 
then touch it to the post and look for a spark. If you
have a newer radio you may see a small spark. Anyway,
if you see a spark jump pull a fuse. try it again.
still there? pull another fuse.. keep trying untill
the
spark goes away. All fuses out? still sparking?
might be a short in the main run from front to back...
anyway the moral is to try and 
1) See if you have a current leak down.
2) Isolate the ckt it is on if one is found.

worth a look.
