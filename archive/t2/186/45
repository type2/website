Subject: Re: [T2] Variation on Locked in Place

My locks get stiff periodically.  Same symptoms you describe.  I also worry
about breaking off my key.  I take them apart and lubricate everything , and
that helps a great deal.  Most resistance it not in the handle, it is in the
complicated lock mechanism.  It is complicated to get it out, there is a
good article in the library about that.  Bentley is also helpful.
