Though that isnt exactly a battery test it does show that problem exists 
with a known battery.  Alternator would have to be good to run vehicle.  
That would possibly leave you with a starter that is pulling way to much 
current, a flaky solenoid or a flaky ignition switch.  If you can 
connect a remote start switch up, see if that works.  If that works it 
will leave you with a flaky ignition switch or cabling in that line. If 
it doesn't work, it doesn't really matter if it is the solenoid or the 
starter as they come together as a package when replaced.
