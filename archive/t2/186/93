Don't have numbers yet. I don't see why it would be significantly different
than with a stock FI that is running well.

I don't see how you can run without the O2 sensor - you need to have it in
order to tune your VE table. Well, yes, you can RUN without an O2 sensor,
but you need one to tune the MS to your engine.

Bruce/Al are working on an LCD dash display (MegaDash!).

Yes! You could reprogram to use one of the LED's as an output to drive a
relay for kicking in/out your compressor!

I couldn't tell any significant difference in response or power. The *feel*
of more/less power is especially prone to interpretation - so real numbers
from some form of measurement are the only thing that mean much to me.

The AFM appears to have the smallest cross section of anything in the entire
intake path, so high rev HP may be improved a bit. I certainly don't know if
this would be significant or not.

Another thing to note regarding MegaSquirt is that since it is so very
configurable, one could easily substitute different injectors running at
different fuel pressure etc. To setup a new FI system you really don't need
to limit yourself to having to include any stock FI components in your
system.
