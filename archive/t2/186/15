Subject: RE: [T2] locked in place 

Kyle, I recommend that you take your handle and lock cylinder apart and 
clean them.

1) Take the door panel off (inside handle first, then the windup handle, 
then the open door pull handle, then the door panel)

2)  Carefully pull aside any plastic sheeting.  It needs to go back as is or 
even better.

3)  Remove the outside door handle with the appropriate size metric hex key.

4)  With door handle of your work bench, and a key in the slot, unscrew the 
little tab behind the handle.  Save/protect/do not lose the screw or little 
tab.  Note the set of numbers on the little tab.  Write these numbers on the 
wall of your garage, right under the light switch.  Do this in pencil if you 
have a significant other sharing the house/apartment/pad with you. You will 
probably memorize this set of numbers before long!!

5)  Push out the key/cylinder from the inside of the handle outward.

6)  Clean the cylinder and everything, including inside the new opening in 
the door handle.

7)  If you are gutsy, you should remove the door locking mechanism and clean 
and replace it.  I don't remember if you need to pull the rest of the door 
apart to do this, though (regulator to get to the locking mechanism?? door 
glass to get to the regulator?? vent window to get to the door glass??. 
[['dem bones, 'dem bones, 'dem dry bones]] But you WILL really be rewarded 
if you do clean the door locking mechanism.  Having gone this far, you 
should go all the way (Gosh, did I really say that when I was 16??  No, I 
remember, I was 35 at the time, the girl was 16!!)

8)  That's all.  Enjoy
