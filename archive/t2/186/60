There are many good books <buy the bentley> out there which cover many
different aspects of the late model type 2 <buy the bentley>. Some are
very simple  & compound many years into one section. Some are funny to

<buy the bentley> of the common jobs. Some are more professional <buy
the bentley> <and reprinted shop manuals. I can't tell you which one
is the best for you <buy the bentley> you most likely want to just
decide for your self <buy the bentley>. No, not pushing any of my own
views here. <buy the bentley>
