Nick,

It seems to me that you can take your receipt and warrantee card back
and at least get a refund.  They should have put the tire serial numbers
on the warrantee card so that will prove that those are the tires they
sold you, and the work order receipt should show that you ordered four
load range D tires, not a mixed set.  Tell them they need to take the C
tires off and put the D's that you ordered on (mount and balance too) at
their expense.

Be nice at first, then if you don't get the proper response, talk to the
manager.  If you aren't satisfied then, take it up with the regional
manager (if it's a chain store) AND the Better Business Bureau.  Make it
clear that it's a safety issue besides being ripped off.
