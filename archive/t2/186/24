The valve stayed put, looks like some of the guide got
mashed between the valve and the seat.  I'll try to
get some pics up this evening.

Can you buy just 1 piston?  I'm half tempted to take
a chisel and/or grinder to this one and see what's left after removing
the flattened guide material. =20

Well, the sludge was caked inside the strainer cap,=20
not in the strainer itself.

I'd love to build one, but right now I'm trying to get this
bus on the road as cheaply as possible until I have saved enough
for a proper rebuild.  I'd prefer to learn to rebuild on my type I
so if I get something wrong, I'm not thrashing expensive type IV
parts. Problem is I can't get started on the type I until I get
this bus running.  Before I start splitting the 1700 cases, I'm tempted
to try to get one going by going through the top end.  I'm a former
small engine mech, so I believe I'm capable, and have most of the
needed tools, just short on time and $$.

Thanks,

Rob
