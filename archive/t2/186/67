Chris,

I have been on the MS list since about March, and yes, the folks there are
prettty serious about people reading the old archives.(RTFM).

I have a MSCS and have put electronic kits together since I was about 8, 
so it's not such a serious thing for me.  Yes, it will take some 
concentration to get it put together, but I don't think much more than a 
newbie rebuilding a t4 engine.

It's *not* going to be for everyone until someone does it on a t4 and 
tells the world.

My push for it is that I *want* the power provided by my t4 engine with 
the cam in it that says "not recomended for FI"...so I *can* be a power 
junkie too!<grin>

There *is* a guy on the list that is running megasquirt on his t4 engined 
bus!...maybe not well yet, but he is running.

My other push is to get rid of lots of parts off of my stock fi system.

No more resistor packs
No more afm
No more double relay
No more cold start injector

Uses stock head temp sensor
Uses stock injectors and intake manifolds
Uses stock throttle body

You can tune it with a laptop.
The code to do this is available on the net and free!

A lot of those guys on that list are doing really weird stuff that equates 
to drag racing and that is why they are building the fancy fuel rails and 
throttle body setups.  The ones that are in to this sort of thing say that
when they switched from afm type stuff to MS, the difference was just 
incredible!

Makes me wonder....$$$$$$$$ for fancy carbs or $150 for megasquirt.
IF those folks are going to megasquirt instead of carbs, whats' up with 
that!!

Chris, what you are doing with the Corvair stuff is somewhat beyond me!  I 
don't have a machine shop so it seems difficult....guess it's just what 
you *know* and are used to.

BTW, I quit doing vw stuff for a while(15yrs) cause I thought the 
stock fi was too complicated!  If I can take a 78 stock fi bus that has
sat for 8 years and follow the Bentley on the test procedure for fi and 
get it running, I figure anything is possible!!

And, I will let you all know how it works out!

Cheers, dave
