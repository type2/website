This is more an oberservation really . I have a HAYNES manual and the
IDIOT'S GUIDE for VWs . My fuel injection system does NOT have a Throttle
Vavle Switch ( just another name for a THROTTLE POSITION SENSOR ) . Both
books list two types , one is under the Throttle and one is on top of the
Throttle . Mine has none of the above , it does NOT have a place to mount it
, in other words it has no screw holes for one to even be mounted in either
position . Also there is NO connection for a Throttle Vavle Switch to the
Control Unit . I guess my question is , is there a book that is not so
generalized ? Certainly my van is not the only one produced like this . Is
there a book that is more specific than these Haynes manuals . I have been a
professional mechanic for 13 years , usually we get Chilton's Manuals ,
NEVER Haynes . But I can't seem to find one for my Van . Any help on GOOD
manuals would be appreciated , thanks .
