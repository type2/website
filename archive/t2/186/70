Subject: 1979 used steering box available

Volks,

I have the steering box off the 1979.  I only pulled it because somone
said they knew someone who wanted it.  Well, it took me so long to pull it
that the bus it was to go on has been sold and moved and they no longer
want it.

I would like to be rid of it, as I have no use and really no place to
store it (OK, yeah, it could go in the basement, but I am really trying to
clean out the basement :)

The good:  it is dry outside, does not appear to be leaking.

The bad:  It has a bit of play.  Not much and it could almost certainly be
adjusted out, but there is sensible play at present.

The really bad:  I really want $50 for it.  Not for the part, that's free,
but rather for the work involved in getting that pup off.  You have no
idea how tough pulling the pitman arm is until you have tried it.  Between
the pitman arm, the drag link and the steering shaft bushing, it is an
easy 2 hours spent under the bus.

As usual, you must pick up, make arrangements with some other DC area
listee to pick it up and ship it, or I can deliver within 150 miles or
to High country at the end of July.
