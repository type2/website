FWIW, I've been told that the white ones have gone obsolete again.  Who
knows if this time it's permanent or not. Last time this happened, it was
seven years before I managed to find any again. Of course I'll try other
sources, but it's not looking great. I was told yesterday that my order for
75 of them from Europe has been cancelled.

At the moment I have about a dozen left.
