Richard

I had a few sets of these ,Continental CR21 tires, none of which *I* purchased
from a dealer,,, but none the less,, they went bad...

This summer when 1 disintegrated on me,, I had to do something, and in my search
I talked to the local continental dealer,,
I recommend you take that tire to a dealer and see what they say...

My dealer  said, bring them all in and he would look at them,,,

tire1 was 8 years old,, been sitting here as a spare for about 4 years.. it was
replaced under warrentee... one side it was worn past the wear bars,, the other
side had good tread,,  he said it was out of round from the day it was built..
It had over 50,000 kms on it...

tire2  had good tread depth left all the way around, but 270 deg of tread was
separated from the steel belt up

tire3 the belt separated

tire4 same as tire2 only a 12" patch of tread was missing

tire5 had nothing but the one bead left, and 2" of sidewall, and he wouldn't
warrentee it..... LOL

I bought Yokohama tires somewhere else,,  they gave me credit for list price of
1 tire against the damaged skins I took them

I have talked to 2 others who bought new Continental CR21 tires a couple years
ago... and are not happy..
