First thing to do is to check the linkage components and the adjustment of 
the plate at the base of the gear lever. Also check the fluid level in the 
gearbox.

However, I had very similar symptoms last year and it turned out that the 
gearbox was stuffed beyond repair. :( At some stage a piece of metal had 
come loose inside the 'box and chewed up the teeth on the ring and pinion. 
This didn't cause the problem, but certainly made it not worth repairing 
the 'box.

Cheers,

Martin Strandgard
