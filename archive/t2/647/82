Subject: Re: [T2]oil coming out of dipstick - so what!!

Try this:

0) fill the oil to exactly the full level mark.

1) take off dipipstick

2) run a hose from dipstick tube hole where dipstick vacated, and feed the 
hose into a peanut butter jar (plastic top, so you can punch a hole in the 
top and feed the hose through; plastic jar so you can tape the jar securely 
somewhere near the dipstick tube)  Use common sense.

3) punch a vent hole in the lid of the peanut butter jar.

4) run the VW at 50 mph for 5 miles.  check how much oil was discarded into 
the peanut butter jar.

6) skip step 5), it was stupid -  refill the oil to full level mark;  run at 
65 mph for 5 miles.  check how much oil . . .


If you are happy at  50 mph, and unhappy at 65 mpg, then you have the answer 
to your problem, which is, how do I become happy with my VW.
