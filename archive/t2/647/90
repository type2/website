You could add a vent hose in the top of the block couldn't you? Run it to the same oil/air separator as the heads and the same line could act as a vent and an oil return. Large enough that the venting pressure and the oil could share the hose. Maybe 1/2"-3/4"  Vent the air/oil separator to the air cleaners so you don't make more smog than the rest of us.
