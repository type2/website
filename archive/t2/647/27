You know, it really ticks me off how draconian they are about their
stupid logo. If it's not being used in a way that dilutes their image
or reputation, I don't see the harm in allowing enthusiasts to use
it..

I applied months ago to be allowed to use their logo on Great White's
site and have never had a response. Not a yes, not a no. Nothing.
