Subject: Watch and learn..... (engine restoration)

Hey guys, am building a day to day section on a VW 78 Westy engine 
restoration, you are invited to check that section every day just to see 
how an engine goes out, is cleaned, sealed, check and bla bla bla.... 
one of the worse leaking VW i have seen in years.... this section is 
mostly for the newcomer....

If you have any comments or suggestions wile we are doing that, you are 
welcome to do so.

I also did a section on old and bad FI / Carb hoses.
