Being a child of the 90s, I'm I probably missed out on a lot of bus
related anthems. Can anyone recommend some songs that should be on the
mix?

This song is called Alice's Restaurant, and it's about Alice, and the 
restaurant, but Alice's Restaurant is not the name of the restaur-
ant, that's just the name of the song, and that's why I called the
song Alice's Restaurant... :-)
