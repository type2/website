Subject: Stuck Gas Cap

Hello list,

A friend of mine as a little issue, the Gas Cap is stuck.

Facts:

68 bus (double cab), all original

Pressumed overtorque gas cap

rotates freely for only 3mm then stop solidly on any directions.

Has this happend to anyone here?   At this point we're kind of affraid 
that a part might have to get destroyed in order to solve this


VW ethousiast Julie Aleva's Memorial Drive is Sunday morning (early); 
and my friend would love to participate. 

The friend is Richard Troy.
