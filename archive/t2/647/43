<her restaurant had been Sony's Restaurant for over 20 years>Krispy Kreme Wants Krispy Kream To Drop Name

POSTED: 1:37 am EDT October 30, 2004

BELSANO, Pa. -- Forget "Kramer vs. Kramer." What could be shaping up is Kreme vs. Kream -- doughnut maker Krispy Kreme telling a seasonal ice cream stand to change its name. 

Jack and Christine Hoover have run the Krispy Kream stand in Cambria County's Blacklick Township since 1968, keeping the name that'd been in use since the stand opened in 1961. 

Recently, the Hoovers received a letter from Krispy Kreme complaining of trademark infringement and indicating that more "formal steps" would be taken if they don't stop using Krispy Kream. The Winston-Salem, N.C., based Krispy Kreme registered its name in 1951. 

The Hoovers have hired a lawyer hoping to lick the doughnut company, but they worry that Krispy Kreme's dough may prevail. 

"We're well known for our ice cream, and we have a large sign in the front picturing a boy holding an ice cream cone, not a doughnut," Jack Hoover said. Krispy Kream doesn't sell doughnuts. 

The Hoovers say customers might think the ownership of the stand has changed if they have to change the name. 

Krispy Kreme, however, said that's not the company's problem. 

"Unfortunately, this business is using a fully protected trademark, and we have to protect it," spokeswoman Amy Hughes said. "It can create confusion."
