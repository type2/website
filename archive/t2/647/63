Subject: Re: [T2]how many miles on a tank of gas

Hi Chris,

I get about 18 mpg with my weber progressive. Richard submitted a link
to Chevron the other day with an article about winter weather hurting
gas mileage an average of 20-25 % depending upon your habits. Part of
the article, or part of a prior discussion indicated putting high
octane gas in your VW is unnessary if your motor is stock if you want
to check the archives.

 just curious how many miles a 76 bus should get on a tank of gas?
 
 i am running a weber progressive and checked the milage and have
gotten from full to empty or near empty 150 miles.

 for the record we were using the high octane gas but cant afford that
so have no choice but to be using the regular unleaded now which still
strips around 20- 25 bucks away every fill up.
