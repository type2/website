Well, the T4 will certainly be more dependable power. It takes a
pretty punched out T1 to equal the stock T4. It is geared for the
hills, but it will be slower than a bay with the corvair.

   I appreciate the feedback on this. A T4 powerplant would be nice and
 easy since I'm familiar with them (rebuilt a couple). Does anyone know
 if the later bay engine support will bolt in to my 68 without major
 mods? This might be moot of course if this corvair block comes through,
 since I'll probably end up going that route, and I believe the adapter
 kit comes with it's own engine support. Really, I'd like to get as much
 oomph out of this rig as possible, since I already have Trixie (my 64)
 and have the slow lane covered. I'm a builder of homes and such, not
 cars, although I've done my share of vw's in my life. I'd like to beef
 her up, but am not really into doing anything too contrived at this
 point. I'm hoping to be able to use Amy (my 68) as my daily driver for
 work mainly and this entails LOTS of hauling heavy
 tools/materials/detritus/etc... on the freeways, highways, and mountain
 roads of the entire left coast. Thus, the more dependable power I can
 get out of her the better.
