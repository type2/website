Subject: got a throttle return spring??

does anyone have a tight throttle spring for a 2.0L FI bus? mine was 
stretched out. tried replacing it with a FLAPS one to no avail. all i can 
find are those "HELP" brand ones. one is too tight, the others are too 
loose. my bus is idling way too high and i cant get it to settle down. if i 
pull on the spring the idle will go down. (i have taken it apart a couple 
times and cleaned it out so i know its not sticking.)

and i cant get my stewart warner to work either :-( just cant seem to get 
any spark. i have a few different manuals and many wiring diagrams, but cant 
seem to get a spark.

thank you!
