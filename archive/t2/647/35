if that isn't right. just locally we had a Phillipine woman that had an
asian restaurant, here name was "Sony Florendo"  her restaurant had been
Sony's Restaurant for over 20 years when the TV giant decided they somehow
had their copyrighted name offended and sued this woman.

she did not have the resources to fight them and they very generously gave
her a year to phase in a new name....

next time in Baltimore stop in at "Florendo's Restaurant"
Bus content, she thinks the buses are really neat and are invited to park
right in front
