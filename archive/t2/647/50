ok.  i'm now realizing i didn't word my question as
carefully as i should have, but i think you've
answered it anyways.

someone might be selling me a nearly complete FI
system from a 1978.  so i would be using all 1978 FI
in a 1975 engine, which, based on what people are
telling me, should be workable.

thanks to everyone who responded and everyone who gave
me links.

cheers,
will
