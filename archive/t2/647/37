It's been my experience that the detonation or pinging
that you can hear is just the tip of the iceberg. The
less severe detonation that you don't actually hear
contributes to overheating, shorter engine life, and
loss of power. I've built 2.0L engines with a 7:1 CR
that felt like they had more power than those with
stock CR. I know Jake will disagree but IMHO a CR much
over 7:1 is counterproductive for a street engine. As
always: "your mileage may vary"
