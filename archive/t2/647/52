Hi Folks,

I live 2 miles from my office, and I usually ride my bicycle to work.  
However, on inclement days or cold days I (get to) drive my Bus.  On those 
days I take a longer, more scenic route so the engine warms up well.  
Sometimes I'm torn between riding my bike and driving my Bus, since driving 
the Bus is so much fun!  I usually arrive at work or at home with a smile, 
which I seldom see on those who commute in more generic cars.

Just my 2 cents....
