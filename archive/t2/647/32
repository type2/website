Subject: [T2]how many miles on a tank of gas

just curious how many miles a 76 bus should get on a tank of gas?
 
i am running a weber progressive and checked the milage and have gotten from full to empty or near empty 150 miles.
these miles were all town miles; no highway miles.
 
i would think that i should get better gas milage than that?
Maybe i am wrong?
my wifes 68 beetle{1500 engine solex single carb} gets around 200 miles round town on a tank?
 
just trying to save some money here and wanting to know fi the vehicles are doign as they should be?
thanks for anyone willing to take the time to post back a reply.
peace and love
chris 
for the record we were using the high octane gas but cant afford that so have no choice but to be using the regular unleaded now which still strips around 20- 25 bucks away every fill up.
