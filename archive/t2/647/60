As Dave said, the legal firm has been fired, so you now see all the
unlicensed logo artwork, T shirts, jewelry, accessories, etc showing
up at the shows and ebarf. I even bought VW logo mudflaps from Rocky
Mountain Motorworks, but it was on evay, not through their catalog.

I think the coffee mug art could be protected as art, but for Mike to
step forward and manufacture is a bit risky. A lot of the VW logo
merchandise is manufactured off shore and more out of the reach of
VW's lawyers.

Making a vw clock from a hubcap, clutch or other VW manufactured part
that came off your bus is simply your right to resell merchandise
purchased from VW.

 They **will** go after people making *any* repro's with the vw logo on
 them.  They lost an $80,000 sale at the local dealer cause they went
 after a guy's wife that live just up the road from me....because she hand
 painted a splity on a coffe cup and sold it at a show.  The $80,000 was
 for an already ordered NEW vangon and NEW beetle.  The dealer lost the
 sale because these folks got a letter from VWOA lawyers about the coffee
 cup sale.
 
 I don't condone this and the lawyers at that time have since been fired by
 VWOA....and hopefully replaced by some that are little more intelligent.
