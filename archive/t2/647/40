She might possibly have won that one, if she could have afforded to fight
it. AFAIK, trademark law generally applies only to businesses selling like
product. So if your name were McDonald, you could open up McDonald's
Furniture Store but you couldn't open McDonald's Diner.  For example, The
Bus Depot name is trademarked for use in the sale of automotive and truck
parts and accessories. If someone were to open up a clothing store and call
it The Bus Depot, I'd have to prove that there was a high likelihood that
people would confuse that company with mine (perhaps if their speciality was
shirts with pictures of VW Busses on them).

As Bob alluded to, Sony Florendo would have had to fight Sony Corp. in court
to keep the name, and the cost of going up against a giant like Sony (who
has their own in-house team of attorneys) would have bankrupted her. So she
had no choice but to cave in, whether she was legally in the clear or not.
Big corporations like Sony can pretty much do whatever they want to "the
little guy" by merely the _threat_ of a lawsuit.  Whether you would
ultimately win in court is irrelevant if you don't have deep enough pockets
to fight the battle in the first place.
