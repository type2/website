List,
 
Get 'em while they're hot! (and if you're not)

We have a small number of glow plugs in stock for BN2, and BA6 heaters. I am
pretty sure we also have glow plugs for BN4 heater, but I have not added
them to our site as yet. I will do so in the next few days. If anyone on the
list has a new glow plug for a BN4 that they can photograph and send me the
photo, it may speed up this process.

I am looking into adding to our supply with an order from the OE supplier,
but it is not yet confirmed that they have stock. For the time being, we
have a limited supply and when it runs out, that will be it. The supply from
VW has dried up, even of the BA6 plugs. But if you want a new fuel pump for
a BA6 or BN4 you can get one from VW for 679.00. Whoops.
