Subject: Re: [T2] more on Emblems...does anyone make emblem accessories?

Don't know if it is true or not.  But supposedly if you change the design 
(ever so slightly) you should be safe :)

Any one know if this is true?

PS the 74 Riviera running on veggie oil, is well  :)  Drove 20 miles in to 
work this am running on veggie oil  So I saved at least one gallon of gas 
for y'all.  Use it wisely  :))
