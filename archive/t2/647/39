Don,

They **have** to be draconian....it is up to the copyright holder
to(in legal parlance)  

"vigorously defend" their copyright...otherwise it falls in to the public 
domain.

We had this discussion over on the vintage vw list several years ago when 
the VWOA lawyers(fired now) went after a guy who made a clock out of one 
of his hubcaps and sold it on ebarf....they went after him with a 
vengeance, but in my estimation, hadn't a candle's chance in hell...cause 
they guy took the hubcap off of his properly purchased vehicle.

They **will** go after people making *any* repro's with the vw logo on 
them.  They lost an $80,000 sale at the local dealer cause they went
after a guy's wife that live just up the road from me....because she hand 
painted a splity on a coffe cup and sold it at a show.  The $80,000 was 
for an already ordered NEW vangon and NEW beetle.  The dealer lost the 
sale because these folks got a letter from VWOA lawyers about the coffee
cup sale.

I don't condone this and the lawyers at that time have since been fired by 
VWOA....and hopefully replaced by some that are little more intelligent.

Bus content: the vw emblem on my bus came from the factory<grin>.

Cheers, dave
