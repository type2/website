Bob,

I have some glow plugs that are numbered 111 963 319. The BA4 part number
should be 411 963 319, but the ones I have look the same as the 411 (correct
BA4) part number. I am trying to verify that the ones I have are correct for
the BA4, and until I do so, I don't feel right selling them. As soon I can
make sure they are correct, I will put them up for sale. If anyone on the
list is a BA4 expert, I would be happy to send them a photo of the ones I
have for confirmation.
