After looking through both sites to compare prices, there might be a market
for resin repro's.  If and when I find the three emblems (up to '67, '68 to
'72, and '73 to '79), I'll give repro'ing them a whirl.  Well five if you
include the vanagons ('80 to '88 and '89 to '91), but there might not be a
strong market for the vanagon ones.

Figure $25.00, plus shipping.  They could be 1. Ready for priming or
chroming, 2. Bronze, 3. Silver, 4. Gold, 5. Copper, and 6. Gun metal.
