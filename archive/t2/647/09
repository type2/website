I'm just curious...What exactly does CarFax report and how does it know...?-(
After a vehicle stops going to the dealer for scheduled maintainence or re-
pairs how would it know what repairs or alterations an owner did either him-
self or at a private garage...Other than accident reports, I can't see how it 
gets its info...
