Subject: Re: [T2] Stuck Gas Cap

When I got my bus, the gas cap was one of those deals with a sort of
"riveted in the center" tab sticking up from the cap itself.  You twisted on
the tab to rotate the cap off.  After a few fill-ups, the cap got so hard to
remove that I actually bent the tab.  Nearly broke it off the last time.

Then some how the gas disappeared one night from the bus and I replaced it
with a locking gas cap.  No more problems.

I figured that the seal on the old cap had worn and aged to the point where
it produced a lot of friction.  The new cap snaps in and out and works fine.
