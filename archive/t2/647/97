Subject: Re: [T2]oil coming out of dipstick(update)

ok before i answer the emails and i plan to but later this evening after i have at least done the peanut butter jar trick i think that will make me feel better and let me know whats blowing out cause it should if tottally dipstick all blow down the tube into jar till i get home and take jar off for inspection!
I am working right now so it will be this evening before i can sit down and make sure all that took the time to write me back can have a response also from me and a better thanks!
 
My question before all this is what in the world would cause the motor to all of a sudden be throwing up this way.
Ok lets say it is blowby? Ok so if it is whats causing it after this being a 8ooo miles on a fresh rebuild? Thats where i need to pin point my direction.
If it is something as the rings have went bad or it has a hole in the piston?<?
i need to know if possible a better area in shooting for solution here?
if it is one of these things i want it fixed and am willing to tear it all back apart to do so! But not anxious at all before being done so.
my compression turned out good so i am not sure what that says about a hole in the piston or the rings as well>? everything over 100 on cold morning.
I am not that mechanically inclined but also dont want to end up on the side of the road with no heat and my wife and little girl over something i could possibly fix now cause something has gone wrong inside the engine causing all the blowby?
 
 
want to fix it now and that way i can calculate some down time and labor and parts?
course parts will have to come if it is torn down cause wont know till then whats up.
peace and love til laterz

You could add a vent hose in the top of the block couldn't you? Run it to the same oil/air separator as the heads and the same line could act as a vent and an oil return. Large enough that the venting pressure and the oil could share the hose. Maybe 1/2"-3/4" Vent the air/oil separator to the air cleaners so you don't make more smog than the rest of us.
