Subject: Kadron Float Height - Dave Bolen

Dave, Have only had ONE reply re: Kad float height, and they said to hang it
upside down, and the top of the float should be just equal with the edge of
the float chamber. Sorry, that's the best I could get from two pretty
informative forums. Better than a kick in the pants though. :-)
Take care,
Courtney
