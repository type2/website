There is the obvious 'Magic Bus'
'Land Down Under' by Men At Work mentions a 'fried out Kombi'.
Not a bus song, but Speech had a song called 'Super Beetle'
Ice Cube mentioned his Bug in a couple songs.

Thats all the VW related songs I can think of at the moment. But its your mix CD, put whatever feels good on the cd!
