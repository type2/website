Not strictly a VW Bus song, but was used in a great VW ad...

_Pink Moon_ by Nick Drake.  It was used in a Cabrio ad some years 
back... a group of 20-somethings were driving along a road in the woods 
with the top down, marveling at the fireflies, the moon, the stars, the 
trees... they arrive at the party at the cabin, and in their headlights 
they see a bunch of obnoxious drunk people... so the back down the 
driveway and head back out on the road to enjoy the beautiful evening.

I think it's one of my favorite ads of all time, and those of us in 
California can recapture some of the feeling evoked by that ad by 
driving out to a camping spot near the ocean, popping up the Westy top, 
unzipping the flap, flopping down on the top bunk, and gazing out while 
listening to the waves crash on the beach.

BTW, all of Nick Drake's stuff was great, not just _Pink Moon_ :-)
