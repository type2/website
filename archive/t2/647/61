Subject: Lower mounting studs for case

Managed to snap off the lower engine case stud that projects out the bottom
of my AH case, and bolts up to the tranny using 17mm nuts. One of the two
big bottom ones. That leaves me with 3 to bolt the engine into place, which
is not a good thing. Has anyone seen these for sale anywhere? I can't seem
to locate one anywhere.

Thanks,

Courtney
