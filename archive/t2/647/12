I don't think a frame support is necessary. My understanding is that
VW only put in that wrap around for DOT safety compliance.

Also, literature I've read states T4 engine is only 40 pounds heavier
than T1. My experience is that I can lift a T1 engine with one helper,
but the last fully equipped T4 engine we bought took two helpers. The
last T4 I bought took only one helper to lift was it had no muffler or
clutch on it. If it was even a hundred pounds heavier, I would not
have been able to lift it.

A T1 engine is nice because your bus was made for that. After a few
months on this list, I have decided T4 is a longer lasting superior
engine if you watch your head temps to avoid dropping a valve and care
for your exhaust studs.

 The early one is a LOT lighter weight.  Also, the rear apron
 of the early bus comes off... on the late bus it does not and the rear
 is part of the frame.  Remember, the T4 engine is several hundred
 pounds heavier than a T1 engine.  I think you would need to weld a
 support across the rear of the frame like the late buses have.  That
 heavy T4 engine hanging back there would overstress the frame in time.
 
 A better option is to build your self a larger T1 engine.  1776 is a
 great engine for a bus - pleanty of power.  Much bigger than that and
 you run in to expensive problems.
 
 Have fun!
