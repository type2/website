Is this a garage on a house or is this a parking garage?

If its a parking garage then I would suggest that a simple set of dropped 
spindles for the front and adjustable lowering plates (boomerang) for the 
rear.....that wll drop your bus about 2" safely can always be returned to 
stock if needed....

If its your house garage then I would do what Tony suggested, raise the end 
stopping point of the garage door to clear your bus.....
