Yeah, this is kinda dangerous because you're not getting a richer 
mixture at higher loads.  I'm running around 12.5:1 at full load.

go get an LC-1.  Don't even hesitate.  Just drop the 200 bux and install 
it.  Make sure you put the heater on a relay (starter hot-start relay 
works great).

It's the best accessory you can get for your setup hands-down as you can 
*finally* get some control over your mixture.  You might even want to 
get a cheap-o 0-1v NB LED meter just so you can see the mixture without 
requiring the laptop.
