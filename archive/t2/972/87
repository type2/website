What head temps did you have before all the changes? The only times I 
have seen head temps above 400 deg F have been due to vacuum leaks (I 
have a 2l 76 camper stock except weber prog). To put it more bluntly 
I would look for the root cause of the problem before I went swapping 
cams, putting on water injection, etc.
