Subject: Re: Popped valve seat picture

Hey Phil, I do have the Dakota CHT on #3, and I kept it under 450F, but 
close to it for fairly long stretches. I now know that is too hot.  And 
the oil gets very hot and the pressure starts to drop at lower revs as 
well after awhile..  Yea, it was over the line for long term reliability.

My local air-cooled head guy will be able to fix the head anyway, and he 
is talking about peening the seats in place for a little extra insurance 
in case any of the others try to escape. I am going back to the stock 
cam from the much higher lift Webcam 107i, so I will be watching for 
cooler temps.

I'll experiment with H2O injection later once its together and settled 
in, and with a couple of thousand miles to make me feel comfortable.

Anyone want to buy a barely used Webcam 107i, made for 2.0lt type 4, 
hydraulic valves?
