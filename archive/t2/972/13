Nope.

The shocks don't adjust the ride height, the springs do that.  Pull off
the shocks and you'll see that the bus sits at the same height.  The
shocks dampen the spring motion to keep the bus from bouncybouncybouncing.

In our case, we have torsion bars in the back and a (relatively) odd setup
of twisting leave springs in the front.

To lower the ride height with the springs the torsion bars can be
re-indexed to lower the rear.  The front's would need the front beam to be
disassembled and have an adjuster welded in.


Now back to the problem:

Is the bus hitting the garage door (overhead) or the top of the door
frame?

If it's the door, you can often squeeze an extra few inches out of it by
hand-holding it up higher.   Garage door openers also restrict the door
from opening entirely, so check that.

If it's the door frame you're hitting, you've got 3 options:

Raise the door frame.

 Is there a trim on the top of the frame that can be removed (replaced
with something thinner?)?

 Otherwise..well..yeah.  rebuild the opening time.

Lower the floor.

 Not a bad option.  Either grind an inch off the floor thickness, or dig
it out, dig it deeper, and replace it.

Lower the bus.

 Lower it on the springs, or use spindles & other hardware.  Check busboys
from some options, but I'm sure there are others.



All of these options will cost you roughly the same, I bet...ballparking
in the 2000 to 2500 range depending on how much work you do yourself.
