Bob, Glad you found the prob. Now, for everyone else:
My policy with my bus engines was that any time
something changed radically, I did a compression test
FIRST so I knew what the playing field was. Without
that knowledge, you end up replacing parts with parts
with parts and maybe end up worse off than you were to
start with. You know that! When you get it back
together, do a compression test and keep a record.
After about 500 miles, do a compression check and keep
a record. After that, you don't really need to do one
until something changes in performance. Compression
checks are actually easier than all the stuff you went
through and you still ended up doing one anyway! -BaH
