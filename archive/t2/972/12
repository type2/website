 Zack, my '79 had 'em but the outfit that did the
conversion to camper when it was brand new hacked them
 out (with an axe, I think!) They covered the ragged
edges with shag carpet. In fact, they covered
everything with shag carpet!
 
When I fixed my cargo area floor, I filled all the
corrugations with foam and added some furring strips
(or is it firring strips?) to support the new, flat,
20gauge sheetmetal floor. To support the front edge of
the floor, I added another piece of 20 gauge the width
of the bus, making a vertical wall against the back of
the seat risers / fenders. The bottom of that piece is
bent at 90 degrees creating a shelf for the floor to
rest on. The top is bent at 90, a half inch, then
another 90 to create a stiffener. I only went as high
as the top of the risers.

Next I added another piece of sheetmetal to enclose
the area between the seats. That compartment has been
many things over the years, but now it is the home of
my heater.

When those pieces were added it really stiffened up
the old bus! I finished it all with pickup bed liner
from front kick panels to rear engine riser making for
a totally water proof cabin - easy to hose out when
needed.

Bus #2 will be getting a similar treatment, but I
think I'll spend more effort on getting seats that can
be re-configured easily between camping and driving. I
really like the ability to drive til I drop and have
the back seat already dropped down and bed made up -
as easy as it is to do that, it's just a PITA when yer
dead tired. In the same sense, when yer at the
campground and need to make a grocery run or an ice
run, it would be nice to have those rotating seats
(that I removed!) It's also nice to have the
recliners for that after lunch nap that seems to be
more important for me nowadaze! -BaH

 I was afraid the answer would be that they aren't
 easily removable/ 
 installable.
