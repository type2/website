Seat of the pants dyno - not a noticeable change in either. 
Certainly I was not able to bop around at 75 mph without pushing 
to the max, and then I was having the heat issue.  I wasn't 
running lean according to the o2 feedback, so I really don't have 
an explanation.   Someone mentioned the higher lift would only 
produce results at high rpm due to a need for higher intake 
velocity levels around the valves.  The cam may actually decrease 
low end torque.  All in all a bit of a disappointment.  Perhaps 
too many changes all at once.  Megasquirt, cam, rebuild of 
everything, MSD ignition (that part works well).
