hehehe.. I don't know if it was me, or what, but I wasn't particularly 
impressed by death valley.  I drove through there and camped (in the 
bus) and they ran out of gas at the gas station at the bottom (at the 
ranger station) and then they ran out of gas at the station when we 
exited towards the 395.

We went when everyone was going nutty over all the wildflowers in bloom 
(I forget what time of year it was).  I think we were expecting wild and 
crazy amounts of flowers.. like fields of flowers that you can lay in.. 
but it was more like 1 every 5 inches or so, and small at that.

I'm not much of a desert rat, so that's probably why, but other than 
that, it was kinda neat...
