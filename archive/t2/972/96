After doing some research and visiting a local Bosch store, I came up
with this: The coil and transistor unit is an aftermarket part/add-on
that can be used with almost all dizzys that use points.

The benefits (at least according to the factory brochure) should be:
-steady ignition current at high rpms
-less inertia since parts are electronic
-high switching capacity due to contactless switching of the power
transistors

But since the original wiring is missing and a new one is horribly
expensive, it will take some time for me to fabricate a wiring and try
this out.

Anybody has any experience with this setup?

Cheers,

Timo
