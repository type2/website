The first thing to do is crawl under and have someone turn the
steering wheel back and forth. Most problems are easily seen. Look for
places where one thing is moving, but not the part attached to it. The
center link pin is a likely culprit (Jason's bus has this). Drag
links, tie rods, etc, all show during this test as well. Ball joints
may or may not be visibly bad, and the rear bushings can cause lots of
wandering and not be visible at all.

Good luck!
