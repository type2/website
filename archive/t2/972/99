Subject: oil and improved power from using another ignition system

I am getting the impression more and more to not change my bus from stock to
anything else for now.

 

I think I need to get back to a good Oil like Castrol or Shell Rotella T.

 

Dump it at 5000 KM. Replace the Filter and check the engine carefully.l

 

As a man named Dana told us at the Gates broadcast transmitter training
course said. "The enemy of good, is better".
