Subject: [T2] Bosch ignition parts

Hello all,

I got some bosch ignition parts for free and have some questions about
them:

-TCI-ignition coil (blue)
-transistor unit (small box, blue)
-The wiring is missing

Is it possible/does it make sense to put this on a type4 engine? Can
this system be used with a stock dizzy?

Just curious, cheers

Timo
