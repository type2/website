Subject: T1 Oil Dipstick tube - came out!

Hi All -

The obvious question is: How do I re-secure it?

Caveats: It is an AutoLinea aluminum case. The tube itself looks to  
be aluminum as well.

I measured a standard (brass?) tube on a standard AS41 case, and it  
hangs out 1.5". I tried to remove the standard one out of the  
standard case, but can't get a grip on it due to it crushing.

So I know that the collar on the dip stick needs to stop 1.5" from  
the case to be accurate, right? Assuming that the part of the  
AutoLinea case is consistent with said part on an AS41.

Ideas?

Mike
