What about an Air-Ride suspension system?

I too have often thought about this problem and the Idea I had was to
get an air ride suspension installed so that I could raise and lower
the bus as needed for the conditions.

Jack it up for clearance over rough roads, lower it for cruising,
highway driving and garaging/parking.

I saw a page on this somewhere but I can't for the life of me find it.


I suspect that this option would be pricey and be completely custom for the bus.
