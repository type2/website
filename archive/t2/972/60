Subject: Clunk in steering

I've had 2-3 hours of slack in my steering wheel for quite awhile.
By this I mean, if the steering wheel is pointing at 7 o'clock and
1 o'clock, as I turn the wheel to the right, it would be slack
until 9-3 o'clock or 10-4 o'clock. Hope that makes sense. I've gotten
pretty good at driving this way on a windy day. :)

Ok, now I have a clunk when turning the wheel through this slack from
one direction to the other.  Any ideas what I'm looking at replacing?
I havent gotten under there yet to see what is going on. Steering
maintenance is new to me.
