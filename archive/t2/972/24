Subject: Re: [T2] How do you remove this? (Seat Belt Latches & Such)

When I was working on mine, I had a VW wrecking yard
near by so I just looked through the various cars
until I found the pieces that would work for me.
Almost if not all the VW cars had interchangeable
components. I have used a grinder to modify the arms
at the other end. I have removed the latch ends
before, but if I remember correctly it's hard to ever
get them to look as good as they did originally, so
it's best to do your modifying at the other end. I
always use some massive bolt in the 7/16" vicinity,
fine threaded and grade '8' with adequate massive
washers or fabricated plate to distribute load as
widely as possible.

It's shocking when you've been driving your camper for
several years and remove the seatbelts some day only
to find that you would have been as safe with a piece
of heavy packaging twine! Not all of our conversion
vans were assembled with much scrutiny in this area -
it's a good thing to take a look at how the're
fastened before they fail when needed! -BaH
