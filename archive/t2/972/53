Subject: RE: [T2] door locks

Ryan, 

Suggest you try removing the lock cylinder from the old locks and reusing
it.  I watched my mechanic do this on my '90 Jetta the other day.  That
cylinder was held in by just one nut (10mm I think).  I don't know how the
bus is, but chances are they have similar designs.
