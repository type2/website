Thanks!!! I do have pictures!

Go to "Current Cars" and the VW is at the bottom!


I'm soo happy that it runs as well as it does. I think the GEX motor just had
old used lifters. I was hesitant to put new lifters on an old cam, but I
suppose that's better than having collapsed lifters banging hard onto an old
cam! :)

drive.  Congrats!
