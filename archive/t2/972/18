Shocks won't do it alone.

First, what are you hitting on your garage door?  If you have a single
panel door that sticks through the opening when open you can gain a few
inches by replacing the door with a roll-up door.  Not cheap, but cheaper
than modifying your bus!

If you have to mod your bus, the best way to go is with a set of dropped
spindles in front and readjustment of the rear torsion bars to lower it a
bit.
