Subject: YES!!!! IT'S ALIVE!!!!

Holy crap!!! I'm soo excited! I just took my 73 VW Bus for a spin today! I
just got through replacing all my lifters on the left side (the side that had
the problem) and I let it idle for about 10 minutes. I pre-bled the lifters,
but they still needed a few minutes to pump up and get the ATF out of them. It
started to smooth out and idle fine, and now it hauls ass! I'm sooo thrilled
with my Bus. I took it for a cruise around the neighborhood. Every person that
sees it as I drive by gets a huge smile on their face. I'm soooo happy that
"Skipper" (what my wife calls it) is running again!!!

Time for some beer!!!
