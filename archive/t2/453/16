I put a vent box on my bus and my trike, both with upright engines. I
drilled the front of the valve covers, installed the spigots that come with
the kit, and tie wrapped the breather box into place resting on top of my
transmission. A couple of pieces of rubber hose with clamps, and my engine
has an extra breather system to help relieve excess pressure. Might be a
band aid that will help out till you can get it rebuilt. Tom

Thanks, Andy, I really believe I have worn valve guides, allowing some
pressure to build up into the head/valve cover area.
