Subject: front beam  and steering box swapping

hi there
im a first time owner (and proud as hell) of a 1971 hi-top camper, and i need
to get a new front beam and steeringbox.. this frind of mine got a 74 bus he
wants to sell me :)

question: can i swap the steering box and frontbeam/ whole suspension  between
the two?

i vaugely remember some opst a while ago about installing a pre 73 steering
box in a 71?


thanx in advance
