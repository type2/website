My '72 wheel rim has a center cutout as a circle.  Does the '72 rim rest on 
the hub?? >>

In both cases the wheel is supported by the lug nuts, not the studs...The VW
lug nuts are acorn shaped and should fit very tightly into the concave lug
hole in the wheel. I went through this when a gas station repaired a tire for
me and "forgot" to tighten the lug nuts sufficiently...Within a few blocks,
the wheel loosened and egged out the lug holes in the rim forcing me to put
on the spare in the sleeting rain in NYC...Which is what I tried to avoid in 
the
first place... ;-(
