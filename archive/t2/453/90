Subject: engine coming out..little help?(The Weasel)

Hiya everybody,

     The weasel's engine is ready to come out. Why would I need to sling the 
trans. when taking out the engine only? Wouldn't the trans. bracket hold it 
there? 

I can't afford to rebuild the engine yet, but, I need to fix ALL the oil 
leaks (mains,etc).
If I lose my house (no jobs around here at all) I'll need to drive her 
"somewhere" for storage (or live in her). I'm not going to have any heat apparently 
'cause the oil has all leaked into the heat exchangers. For years. I'll be 
taking off the tin and just running the pipes naked. While the seals are being R&
R'd I'm going to see if the mystery noise is a valve dropping & fix if I can. 
She runs pretty good even with the 1.115-2.115-3.107- and 4.125 compression. 
Maybe I can get away with rings and "different heads." But it needs to come out 
first. So what could someone say about the question in the first chapter of 
this post.?-)

Thanks to all in advance!!!
