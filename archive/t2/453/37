My bus has in the past couple days of me finally being
able to drive has made me understand just how fun
driving used to be..

I make up excuses to go somewhere, i just want to
drive the slow-speed transporter. You cant travel at a
moderate 55-60 mph here in california anymore,
regardless of the time people are always in a hurry..
To tell you the truth it is sad, my bus is making me
relax and take it easy..

Just yesterday im driving my wifes town & country van
and im only doing 55-60, and shes like what is wrong
w/ you lets pick up the pace, i say, for what were in
no hurry, but shes worried about all the people
passing and going around us.. I just smile......

peace,
