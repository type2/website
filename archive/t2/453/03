Subject: It runs! It runs!

After pulling my powertrain 2 months ago for a "quick" clutch job (which
quickly degenerated into a total tranny and engine overhaul) I finally got
my bus started today.  The first start attempt didn't even produce a kick,
but a gas leak started at my new bulked fitting through the driver side tin.
That wouldn't have been too bad but the fuel pump kept running even with the
key off.  I unplugged the hot wire to the pump without flaming myself and
fixed the leak.  After going through the Bentley electrical schematics I
realized that I never connected the two grounds from the fuel injector
wiring harness which plug onto the case under the air distributor manifold
{:-/  With these connected the fuel pump functioned correctly and after 3 or
4 attempts the engine kicked over and ran, and after the lifters pumped up
it ran very nicely with no oil leaks so far.  I still have to figure out my
clutch adjustment, it feels kinda weird compared to the old clutch.  I can't
get 3rd or 4rth gear yet but I did replace all the shifter bushings, rear
fork, plus the shifter itself and the front shifter rod as well.  I tied
adjusting the shift gate plate but no luck, I'll try again tomorrow.  It
looks like the gate isn't positioned correctly.  The gears that I do get are
very precise 'though, feels like a new van :)  I ran into another bit of
problem, I replaced my 77 exhaust with an earlier model from a 1800 I think.
I replaced it 'cause my triangular flanges were thin and I got the new heat
boxes and muffler for free (the muffler looks like stainless steel, I had to
straiten out a bend in it with a 3 ton press...fits perfect!).  I can't get
my rocker covers off with the new heater boxes, I have to pop one end of the
retainer wire off the head to get the cover out.  Is there something that
I've done wrong or is there a different retainer wires for the pre triangle
flange exhaust systems?  Its a real pain to get the covers off now but I did
convert to a hydraulic cam and lifter so I wont have to remove them every
3000 miles any more.  Sorry for the long post.  My wife wasn't too excited
about all this so I had to share my progress with someone ;-)
