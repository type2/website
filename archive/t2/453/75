Subject: Pulling engine - what work to batch with it?
Message-Id: <B319E423-ED66-11D7-A73F-000A957650EC(-at-)wasabisystems.com>

Unfortunately, I don't have the space to do this myself, so it's
heading into Buslab for the work.  Since the main cost is in the labor
associated with pulling the engine, I'm getting together a list of
other stuff to do while the engine is out.  So far, my list includes:

- Fuel sender

ggm suggests replace as much as you can afford unless you know the parts are
good for another 50k

new clutch driven disk
new throwout bearing
new front oil seal
new rear oil seal
new fuel lines

new plugs and points---maybe
just slightly easier to do with engine out

replacing the alternator is kinda iffy,
it is certainly much easier to replace the alternator while the engine is up
on on stand, but don't replace the alternator if you know it is a recent
rebuild.

I am sure you will get some more suggestions.
