Subject: Re: [T2] PICTURES of MY Bus !!!

Hmm,

What is shown is the ad is a common interior/exterior color scheme. 
The brown mats are quite cool! What is uncommon is the really nice 
condition (at least in pics) of the bus.

Trivia mode on!

There were very few colors offered in the US for the early bays (1968 to 1970)
Red exterior (my favorite) had either all black basket weave of a two 
tone gray patterned like the one in the ad.
Blue exterior had black interior but I have seen a few blue interiors .
Elm Green ( I had a 1969 as nice as the one in the ad ) had black or 
two tone gray.

In the rarity dept. you would find the 1968 one year only Arizona 
Yellow seen at

Lotus white model 22s are also uncommon but I have seen one in a 
junkyard with a red basketweave interior and it was WAY COOL.

The above applies to model 22 and 28. Trucks were usually tan 
basketweave. Konbis came in a few flavors of tan and I seen one US 
delivery with gray hardboard panels and I thing it was a 1968.

My current 68 was Arizona Yellow but was resprayed powber blue :(. 
The interior is black basket weave.

Thanks
Chris
