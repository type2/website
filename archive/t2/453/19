The other option (sorry if it has been mentioned) are the family channel 
radios.
Whenever a group of us take off somewhere we bring them.
I have a couple nice Kenwood ones that work exceptionally well.

Motorolla makes them as well as lots of little companies.
I get anywhere from 1-3 miles out of them depending on the terrain.
The better quality ones work better too. (tried them)

The nice thing is you can pick your own channel and then use a subchannel
and lock it.  That way you only hear the others you want on your frequency. 
Or you can
scan and see what the general talk is in the area.

Plus when you get there.. they are so small you can just use them as 
walktalkies
and keep dibs on the kids or whatever.. camping/shopping etc etc.

Travelling is such fun!
