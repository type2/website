Subject: RE: [T2] what type oil is everyone using?? grade??

 Depends on where I'm driving and what time of year it is.  Weather
temps in Oregon are pretty moderate, unless you are up in the
mountains or out in the desert.  I usually run 30w in what is
supposed to be winter here, and 20/50w when it gets roastie toastie.
Keeps my type4 2l F.I.'s fairly happy for Oregon.

  Temp recommendations vs. oil varieties can be found in the back of
the manual btw.  Keep in mind that car folks are pretty religious
about oil preference and devout at that.  I've seen screaming
matches start between folks that prefer synthetic and folks that
prefer dino.  It's relative depending on your car, your driving
habits, your temperatures in your area, and simply put,.. your
preference...   Also keep in mind that oil in one country is not
necessarily equal to oil sold in another country.  Different places
will naturally be more discriminating when it comes to oil that is
sold to the public.
there's my two cents worth...
