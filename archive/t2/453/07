make sure the wire bails are in the right orientation. when the bail is
installed, the middle section should loop upwards. if you have it upside
down the bail will hit the heater box and make it hard to remove the rocker
cover. if you have it no the right way around, the bail will swing clear
under the head and allow easy rocker cover removal.

this may not make much sense while reading an email, but it should when
looking at the bail. if you're not sure which way it is up, then just flip
it and see if it makes a difference.
