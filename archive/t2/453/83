Subject: 75 bus westfalia

Hi there

I have a 78' bus and am looking for a project this winter.
I have come across a 75 westfalia with a 2l fi motor. (Obviously not the 
original)
I haven't had a chance to take a good look at it but it's supposed to be in 
decent
mechanical condition but lots of rust.

What's the chances the 75' poptop would fit my 78'?
Since mine is set up with a type 4 motor, the 2l might be ready to drop
in if it's in decent shape.  (mine is a 1700 and I could really enjoy more 
power).

Any thoughts on the idea.  I could probably get it for 1500$ Canadian.. 
around
1100$ish US.
