Oh man, what a cheep shot.
I figure anyone who steels from a Bus owner must be really down and out.
Luckily my PO had installed a camlock style cabinet door lock on the fuel 
door back in the 1970s during the "Energy crisis."
These are available from ACE hardware and require some drilling and cutting.

Glad to hear some good new from you too.
Congrats on your sucessful refrebishments.
