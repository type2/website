Subject: Clutch Problems?

Hello All,
I'm having an increasingly-worsening situation as follows:  when I let out
the clutch (in 1st gear) from a stopped position, I get some substantial
shaking of the bus.  (I have a 79.)  Some occasions are worse than others,
but it is now a constant nonetheless that at times makes all of my camper
interior rattle as if nothing's tied down, and it feels like it's getting
worse.  I have tried adjusting the clutch cable to within spec, but that had
no apparent effect.  I've also tried adjusting my clutch-pedaling technique,
but the problem remains.  Does this sound like a definite clutch problem and
if so, what might that problem be?  (I've never replaced the clutch on this
bus so do not know anything of its history.)   I've been thinking about
having the engine removed anyway to get at a fuel tank problem, so maybe
this would be a good time for a clutch replacement as well.  Thanks for any
info you can pass along!

Travis
