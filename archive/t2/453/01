This past December I bought a 1600dp engine for our 71 from Bob
Donalds at the Boston Engine Exchange.  He recommended 20W50 for hot
weather operations.  In the Bentely manual there is a chart for
recommended oil versus temperature.  I believe it's in the chapter on
routine servicing, that's toward the back of the manual.
