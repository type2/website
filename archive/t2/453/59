Subject: Pulling engine - what work to batch with it?

Folks...

My oil leak is getting worse and judging from input I've received from 
you fine folks and my mechanic, the likely culprit is the oil cooler 
seals.  So, I've decided to have the engine pulled so I can get this 
fixed.

Unfortunately, I don't have the space to do this myself, so it's 
heading into Buslab for the work.  Since the main cost is in the labor 
associated with pulling the engine, I'm getting together a list of 
other stuff to do while the engine is out.  So far, my list includes:

	- Fuel sender

If anybody has additional suggestions for my list, I'd love to hear 
them, and hopefully avoid the cost of pulling the engine again in the 
foreseeable future :-)

Thanks!
