Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch Problems?

well i am no mechanic but i have had the shakes before and i will just got over what i found was wrong with mine and what took the shake out and then you can compare that to whatever anyone else tells you and make you a check list and finally quit doing that shimmy shimmy shake... LOL..

1.check bowden tube make sure has right bend on it..

2.check wear and tear on clutch cable.

3.check wing nut on cable for how tight or loose it is..?

4.check tightness of bolts for transmission connected to motor (all of them)<this includes the top transmission mounts>

5.flywheel could be warped?

6.clutch disc may need replaceing?

7.rear main seal?replace?

8.make sure little ring inside flywheel isnt leaking cant remember the name of it but is right inside the flywheel.. dont want any oil getting on the clutch disk or pressure plate.

9. check pressure plate may need repalceing.

10.you could just be off adjustment with the flywheel ,clutch disk and the pressure palte.

if so there is a tool little plastic do hicky that looks like the splines on the tranny that you can stick in the flywheel after dropping engine and line all three of those back up right with..

may just be shakeing cause either the bowden tube doens have the right bend or might be from the loose tranny bolts or transmission mounting bolts up top..

i found mine shakeing really bad once before and all i had was loose bolts then another time it was from the cutch disc..

hope this helps...
peace to you and yours
and good luck....

Hello All,
I'm having an increasingly-worsening situation as follows:  when I let out
the clutch (in 1st gear) from a stopped position, I get some substantial
shaking of the bus.  (I have a 79.)  Some occasions are worse than others,
but it is now a constant nonetheless that at times makes all of my camper
interior rattle as if nothing's tied down, and it feels like it's getting
worse.  I have tried adjusting the clutch cable to within spec, but that had
no apparent effect.  I've also tried adjusting my clutch-pedaling technique,
but the problem remains.  Does this sound like a definite clutch problem and
if so, what might that problem be?  (I've never replaced the clutch on this
bus so do not know anything of its history.)   I've been thinking about
having the engine removed anyway to get at a fuel tank problem, so maybe
this would be a good time for a clutch replacement as well.  Thanks for any
info you can pass along!
