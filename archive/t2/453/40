There is a solution.

I have a '77 bus, lowered, with custom rims that I use as a work truck.

 I removed the factory heater boxes and installed a set of VW 411 heater
boxes. But before I installed the boxes, I de-skinned them leaving the
"j-tubes" exposed.

I then filed the connection where it meets the head carefully to be true and
with a set of new gaskets, I had "straight pipes"...

I then (with the help of Scott Lyons) removed the flanges on my Porsche
exhaust and re-welded new ones on upside down. Reason for this is because
the Porsche header conflicts with the rear tin, but its doesnt if inverted.

I now have a Porsche exhaust system on my '77 that utilizes "straight pipes"
and its looks and sounds awesome.

But, it will work with the factory exhaust too, with a little finessing on
the muffler. I don't have gauges on this bus yet (not sure why) but the
engine runs cool.
