Hm, now I'm actually confused by what Bentley says:

	1975 fuel injection models			5 ATDC
	with manual transmissions			vacuum hose(s) on
	(engine code letter ED)

	1976 and later fuel injection		7.5 BTDC
	models (engine code letter GD)		vacuum hose on

Ok, my confusion: I do have a 1976, and the engine code stamped on the 
housing does start with GD.  However, I have a dual-vacuum distributor, 
and thus have "hose(s)", as opposed to "hose".

So, which do I use?  (Hm, I guess if I time to 7.5 BTDC and it's wrong, 
I'll hear pinging, right?)
