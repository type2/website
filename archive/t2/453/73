 Bentley says 7.5 BTDC for my '76.  Does that mark look like it's in

 Hm, now I'm actually confused by what Bentley says:

1975 fuel injection models 5 ATDC with manual transmissions vacuum hose(s) on
 (engine code letter ED)

 1976 and later fuel injection 7.5 BTDC models (engine code letter GD) vacuum hose on

Ok, my confusion: I do have a 1976, and the engine code stamped on the housing does start with GD.  However, I
have a dual-vacuum distributor, and thus have "hose(s)", as opposed to "hose".

 So, which do I use?  (Hm, I guess if I time to 7.5 BTDC and it's wrong, I'll hear pinging, right?)

OK, by saying ''the engine code stamped on the housing does start with GD'' tells me you are going by the
engine stamped into the fan housing below the coil. That number is about as worthless as a weather forecast!
Fan housings get swapped around all the time. The true engine case number is either stamped into the case in
the middle where it splits on top [this is usually on AW cases] or on top between the square casting for the
breather and the fan housing [ED, GD and GE].

Since you have a1976 and a dual vacuum dizzy, this tells me it was built before the end of 12/75. As of 1/76,
the FI changed: the AFM went to 7 pins, the EGR became full mechanical, the dizzy became a single vacuum unit
and timing went to 7.5 BTDC.

Timing the engine at a figure after TDC means you have a dual vacuum unit distributor. When Bentley says
vacuum hoses on, this means you should have manifold vacuum at the retard side at idle and it is pulling on
the retard diaphragm. Without vacuum or a working retard side, you can throw that timing figure out the
window. You must verify this circuit is working before you try to set timing.

All dual vacuum bus dizzys time the same as single vacuum dizzys if you remove the vacuum retard from the
equation: set them at 7.5 before without vacuum connected to the retard side.

Depending on the vacuum unit....it can be wrong!... determines timing. 73-74 card engines timed at 10 after.
But this was because it used a 07 113 vacuum unit [925 stamped into the arm] and had 16-18 degrees retard in
it. 75-early 76 times at 5 after because it uses a 07 125 vacuum unit [995 stamped into the arm] and has 11-13
degrees retard in it.

Knowing the distrbutor number stamped into the housing and knowing the 3 digit number stamped into the vacuum
unit arm tells you more than the engine number. The engine number is just the case number when it left the
factory......

If anyone wants to identify a vacuum unit by the number, let me know the number.
