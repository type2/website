Subject: Re: [T2] Center Bore

I had wondered about this as well. I had been thinking that it may have 
been similar to aftermarket wheels on a lot of cars, where the bolt 
pattern works but the hub in the middle is the wrong size and you need 
to get a hubcentric ring to make it run hubcentric (ride on the hub not 
the studs). Now, my winter wheels on my Subaru (15" Enkei RFS2s) 
require a fat hubcentric ring, while my summer wheels (17" OZ Prodrive 
Superleggeras) fit my hub perfectly.

I guess you could always fab yourself a insert if you had the desire, a 
ring with an outside diameter equal to the center bore on the wheel and 
a inside diameter equal to the hub on the bus. Snap that sucker in 
there and you have the load supported (somewhat) on the hub, there is 
always the hell with odd bolt patterns .... I had considered this for 
aftermarket wheels on my 73 Safare but never really did anything about 
it anyways <grin>
