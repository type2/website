my 78 with stock 2L has no heater boxes, my heating tubes were so rotted
that they fell out from under the bus as a rust line,  so removed the
heater boxes from the exhaust pipes and run them bare.  I have had it this
way for over 5 years with no pproblems, the engine runs no hotter, now I
did not trust the thermostat to function correctly without the lower
baffle plate under the heater box so I removed the cable, the flaps are in
the full cool position..  I have converted to the earlier 72-74 exhaust
system but it runs the same level of loud as before I removed the heat.

YMMV
