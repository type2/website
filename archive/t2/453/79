Last week, first time in YEARS, one day needle is dead on half mark. Next 
day down to 1/4.   I do not care at all for the locking caps. I've just 
seen too many of them that don't fit up right, or the mechanism is cheese 
and does not last. I will stop off and get me a cabinet latch lock and 
install it before the weekend. Thanks for the tip.

Regards,
