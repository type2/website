A CB radio allows you to monitor whats up ahead--or behind you-- brought
to you live from the 18 wheeler's that's about it---

And the distance you can receive any info ( or transmit ) depends on the
quality of the radio and the antenna your using.
Straight line, flat ground--maybe 5 miles realistically---some may claim
more--but in the real world 5 miles is about the norm.

No phone calls via a CB
