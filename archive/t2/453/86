Hi James,

You have just driven straight and true, right up my alley of expertise. 
Welcome to the westification zone.

A '75 pop-top will fit your bus quite readily. I installed a '74 
pop-top onto a '79 bus back in the winter of 00/01. It was an excellent 
winter project. Damn shame you're a province-and-a-half from here....

The westification process can be completed in something between 20 and 
100 hours, depending on the level of finish you are looking for and the 
amount of autobody/metalworking proficiency you possess. There is only 
one structural member in the bus roof that needs to be removed and it 
gets replaced by the corresponding element in the donor roof. A 20-hour 
job would be glued rather than welded, and the level of finish would 
be... rudimentary. I contemplated using sheet-metal screws and RTV 
sealant for my project at one point but the donor bus turned out to be 
too good to treat so rough. YMMV.  A 100-hour job should be virtually 
indistinguishable from a factory westy. Plan on getting really familiar 
with your angle-grinder.

For that $$$ I would insist on a leakdown test first. Get the vacuum 
read, too. That will help make sure you're not buying an engine with 
problems. If everything checks out OK, you've got a bargain. If not, 
you've got evidence to haggle with. An engine-less westy can often be 
had for a few hundred dollars.
