Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch Problems?

Travis,

the same thing happened to me on my '65 last week.

I had it towed home and assumed the clutch.
Pulled the engine and found the clutch in perfect shape.

I'm now debating a new transmission.

I hope some other folks chime in on this one on how to diagnose the situation.

Billy

when I let out the clutch (in 1st gear) from a stopped position, I get some substantial shaking of the bus.  (I have a 79.)  Some occasions are worse than others,
