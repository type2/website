Subject: mar-hyde one-step primer

Has anyone used Mar-hyde one-step primer?

I have a number of places on my exterior body where I'm getting bad 
surface rust. This Mar-hyde stuff is supposed to convert rust to primer 
sealer. I thought I'd use it to arrest the rust until I can get to a 
paint job. The instructions indicate that you remove loose scale and 
paint, and paint this stuff directly over the remaining rust.

The guy at my FLAPS said he had good results using it and recommended 
it.

Thanks.
