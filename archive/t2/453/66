Hi Jason,

We had a similar problem last summer when we replaced the engine in 
Jamie Auch's 71 deluxe bus while he was here for Buses Of The Corn. 
Waiting for mail order was NOT an option. We were working at night, so 
even if we could have bought the part locally the store would have been 
closed anyway.

What we did was measure the circumference of the pulley, and multiply 
by 3.14159265 (Pi) to get the circumference. Divide the circumference 
by 360 to get one degree, then multiply that by the number of degrees 
you want to indicate.

On Jamies  7 1/4" diameter pulley the circumference is 22.77655". That 
makes one degree equal to 0.06326819".  To mark the pulley at the 7.5 
degree point simply measure 0.4745114" from TDC and you'll be good to 
go. I don't remember if those are the exact numbers we used, but I do 
know it worked.

Maybe it helps if you're working with "The Kooky Math Teacher"....

Happy trails,
