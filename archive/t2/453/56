Well, if your valves are stable tat 3K, then check at 4K.  If still stable
then increase.  However, one reason to check your valves often is that the
valve condition is a diagnostic indicator to the condition of your heads.

Dwell is not that touchy.  If it's running decently don't mess with it.

I see no problem with going 30K if the boots are in good shape and you
don't get a hole in one.  I usually don't pop things open unless I have a
boot problem.
