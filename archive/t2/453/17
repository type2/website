Hi Sam,

CB radios are very useful for communicating with local traffic. I find 
my CB to be a godsend when traveling with a group of buses.

Pros:
Airtime on a CB is free. You can listen in on the truckers chatting all 
day long. (Bound to be educational, but I'd keep the volume low if 
there are minors aboard.)
CB's work anywhere, whereas cell coverage often fades in remote areas.

Cons:
CB's have a 1- 5 mile range, depending on terrain and antenna 
configuration.
CB's can only talk to other CB's.

I take both when I go bus tripping.

Happy trails,
