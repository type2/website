Subject: distributor help and maybe an exhaust question too

So I need to replace/rebuild my dist. Long story short: 75 MT FI 1.8L engine
was rebuilt to a 2.0L engine a year or so ago (about 16k miles). After the
first 6k miles on the rebuild I noticed I had terrible advance and pinging so
I checked and the vaccum can was not working right. I plugged both vaccum ends
from the throttle housing and set my advance to about 8 ATDC (which gave a
decent run at idle and a decent, but not very great, advance). Course this
isn't the best option (it's like having the dreaded 009 except not right?) but
I've been low on funds and as a result most things are jury-rigged (or is it
jerry-rigged?). Now that things have changed a bit financially I'm working on
getting Lucy up and running as well as I can in preparation for a big trip, or
the auction block (whichever comes first).

So my question is: if the original dist was 022-905-205AB, and my engine has
been rebuilt up to a FI 2.0L (solid lifters), what should I do to replace/fix
my dist? Should I try to find a used one? Should I simply replace the vaccum
can (local shop can get one for $115 - seems kinda spendy)? Am I screwed?

And the exhaust question: this is a 75 with 75 heater boxes - I replaced the
exhaust system about a year and a half ago (from heater boxes back) with an
aftermarket header and muffler that promptly began rusting to nothingness
within a week of buying the piece of crap. I'd like to get a new one again -
can anyone suggest something?

thanks y'all!
