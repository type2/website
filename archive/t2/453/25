Subject: exhaust problems.

Hello,

I have a 73 bus with a collector/quiet pack muffler setup.  While driving, 
my exhaust suddenly got very loud.  When I got home, I found the muffler had 
broken off at the flange where it bolted to the collector.  I welded it up 
just to get me by until I could get a new one, but it was just as loud.  I 
replaced the collector and the muffler a week later, but still just as loud 
with some backfiring when overunning.  I checked the heater boxes and 
snugged up the bolts to the heads.  No change.  I thought I felt an exhuast 
leak but not obvious cracks or damage(I am running bare headers with the 
sheet metal removed from the heat sinks.  I am wondering what to do now, 
what to check.  Is there a way to remove the heat sinks to expose the bare 
pipes?  Is it possible to do this and weld up cracks in the headers?  I 
really don't want to buy new heater boxes.  I have no main heater tube or 
flapper boxes and wouldn't want to replace all that.  I am in a rural area 
in northern NY with no Vw's around to speak of.  Any ideas, suggestions?  
Thanks a always, James.
