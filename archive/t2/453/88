Jason,

I just sold my '76 which had a '79 california engine with the dual vacuum canister like yours.

>Does that mark look like it's in the right place?

Seriously, don't mess around here. Calfornia fails you on smog if you're more than 3 degrees off, and your bus runs crappier besides. Get the scale on your bus, have busdepot overnight you one if need be. Busboys in Redding probably has them.

Verify your distributor part#, because that tells you what to time it to. Engine codes mean nothing 20-30 years down the road.

Get the volkswagon or bosch part# and then cross reference it to the chart located here:

That will tell you exactly what and how to time it to.

Also, your engine should be timed dynamically with a timing light. Static will get you in the ball park, but you're not really on it till you strobe it.
