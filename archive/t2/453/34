Subject: Re: [T2] mar-hyde one-step primer

Mar-Hyde, anyone ???

My impression: Mar-Hyde provides SOME rust conversion, and then leaves a 
protective [clear?] skin.

I applied it to a tiny section of my drip rail. and I did not recover it.  
Five years or more, and still working.

Later, I applied Mar-Hyde to a small patch of surface rust that formed under 
my front fiberglass luggage rack. Again, I did not cover the area, and 
Mar-Hyde is working just fine.

BUT,  now I would use phosphoric acid to remove and treat the rust, and then 
put a cover-all like POR 15 on the area, if I wanted to refinish.


This past Saturday, I attacked a '68 gas cap.  I removed all the PO red 
paint, and sanded the rust as much as possible.  Then I used brillo pad (dry 
and wet) to get more rust off.

Finally, with my nitrite (sic) gloves, I poured phosphoric acid on the gas 
cap.  I lovingly massaged the gas cap with OSPHO (my choice of easily 
obtainable phosphoric acid) for about 10 minutes.  Wiped and rinsed with a 
garden hose, and dried, and applied more OSPHO with my still surviving 
nitrite gloves.

The was NO TRACE of any rust!!  It all washed off.   Even in the inside 
cracks!!

So I polished the gas cap, and coated the outsides of the gas cap with a 
clearcoat of something that would coat shinny brass.


Yes, in years to come, we will find out the results.  But I will probably 
lose the gas cap (has a raised VW emblem on it, so it is probably original) 
way before then.

Mar-Hyde = OK; Extend = Mar-Hyde = OK; OSPHO = phosphoric acid = better than 
OK.
