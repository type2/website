Subject: Re: [T2] front beam  and steering box swapping

I think the beam will fit, but it will have the later front disk brakes on
it, which is probably for the better. The steering box is tougher, the 74
will have the later box, which is not a bolt in conversion. I am planning to
put a new TRW 73-79 box in my 70 ASAP, it will involve some creative work
between me and my millwright buddy.
