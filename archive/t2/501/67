Subject: 72 heater controls

Hi All,

I finally got my 72 out of the garage and back on the street!  Problem 
is, I don't know how to use the heater controls (the knobs/handles are 
missing and I am freezing when I drive it.  I can work the controls 
from under the dash but I need to know the combination that is likely 
to allow some heat to come my way.

Any help is always appreciated!

Thanks,

Dave
