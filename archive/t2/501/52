Subject: Buying Clutch Overhaul Parts Ahead of Time?

I've got a 71 bus. I'll be pulling the engine to install some missing 
cooling parts. I thought it would be a good idea to overhaul the clutch 
at the same time: it's making more TO bearing noise lately. I was hoping 
to get the parts here ahead of time, as the bus is a daily driver. But 
it has been suggested that until the clutch is opened up, one cannot be 
certain which type of parts will be needed. TO bearing and, I guess, 
some of the other parts, too. Is there some way to determine the the 
style of parts used in the clutch prior to opening the patient? Some 
handy number stamped on the side or something, maybe?
