Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Publications?

I just used the $ I didn't spend on trends or hot vws, as I really could
care less about modifying and customizing bugs or water cooled jettas.

Vw Camper and Custom shows real people that drive real buses.  The enjoyment
I get out of the magazine more than makes up for the price.

If the US actually had a BUS ONLY mag that showed buses that actually were
daily drivers, I would subscribe, unfortunately they do not.

Peace,
Snoopy
