Hello everyone.
I hope everyone is doing excellent.
I am so happy to finally be home.
Thank you all so much.
Expecially thanks to Snoopy, Ben, Cha Moon, Will Anderson, Access Bob and 
everyone else who offered parts, knowledge, time, advice, a place to stay or 
work, positive kind vibrations, or support of any type.
This list, and the kindness of the community is priceless.
I hope none of you will ever hesitate to look me up on the airs list for any 
reason.
My door is always open to all of you.
Me, my family, my girlfriend. and our dogs all thank you.
Peace,
Kyle
