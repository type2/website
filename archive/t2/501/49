Subject: RE: [T2] STEEL DASH?

All the bay windows I have ever seen in Australia are standard with a steel
dash. I am impressed with the plastic one over here and if anyone knows
where I can get a right hand drive one I would be thrilled. I suspect if you
were to get an antipodean dash, you and a welder could convert it with ease.
They are easier to modify in terms of gauges and the like. (not that you
would of course)
