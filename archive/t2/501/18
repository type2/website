Check out LiMBO                                                       
http://www.bcn.net/~limbo                                             
also, NEATO, for splits, but I don't have the website handy. They are 
both great clubs with pretty informative and entertaining newsletters 
with a lot of features.                                               
                                                                      
> Does anyone know if there are any (I'm sure there's something)      
magazines or newsletters out there specifically for Air Cooled        
Volkswagens? I'd actually like one JUST for the Bus if they have one.
