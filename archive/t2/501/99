I'm 99.9% sure that there was never a factory option for fog lights on a bus
(at least in 1973).  But you're right, those 2 holes are perfect for the
application.

I put driving lights on mine instead of fog lights and I wanted them mounted
higher so I unbolted my bumper and flipped it over.  The bumper is exactly
the same upside down and right-side up (except for the 2 holes of course).
