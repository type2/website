Wow, that is a lot of money. almost $100 bucks for only 9 issues. That's
over 11 dollars an issue. 
It DOES look like a good magazine though, I checked out one of the
articles, and it showed a complete ground up restoration from a Bus that
was literally rusted to hell. 

Ok, on Tax return time I'll get it!
