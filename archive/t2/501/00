I just saw a post in another forum and the rebuild cost came to about the same price in material and basic labor. It didn't include any shipping costs involved wrt the heads and case if you have to get that work done out of town or the shipping costs for the rest of the parts.

From my own experience all the little things like tools, nut/bolts, paper towels, chemicals, etc usually add up to more than a trivial cost but at least they tend to last more than just one rebuild.
