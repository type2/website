Tony,
Copy that on red being super sool on sports cars...I have a '71 VW T1
Karmann Ghia Cabriolet in Baha Red and it is FINE.
I guess that is part of it...the bus shares space with a the Red Ghia and a
Spruce Green '70 T1 Beetle Saloon.
Local neighbor and friend votes are leaning to Yellow. The kids just want it
done so I can haul large numbers of them.
