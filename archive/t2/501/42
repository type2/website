Mike,

I have tried pmailing you several times in the last two weeks
or so and am not getting a response.  I can see that you are 
responding to email from the T2 list so am trying it this way.

Don't know if your mailer is dumping my messages for some reason or not, 
but I need to get in contact with you about an order(and payment) I placed 
with you last July.


Please email me at dbolen(-at-)shockwaverider.com

Thanks ,dave
