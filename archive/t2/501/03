Mine is running close to $2000.00.  But it's an engine replacement rather
than the rebuild.  Along with all of the other things that you find as you
get into it.  Clutch, starter rebuild, etc..

I haven't driven my bus in over 4 months.  It sat for about two or so in the
drive, and now it's down at the shop for about two.

Man, I'm bummed...
