Richard, I'll bite!

German initials for ok?

IIRC, if you ever see an original T1 engine, on the back side of
the fan shroud(at least 1967) were some similar initials(M.O.) I think.

I think Vincent Molenar?sp had some info about it in some of his
excellent information on id plate numbers.

Cheers, dave
