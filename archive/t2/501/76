Subject: Re: [T2] weird headlight related problem

could be your headlight switch.

mine recently went south. (on I-95, don't know how long they were gone 
before i pulled over and realized it)

next time it happens, use the wiring diagram in bentley's to bypass the 
headlight switch and see if the lights work that way.
