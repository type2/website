> if the clutch is questionable, or making noise. and you have the extra
 $100 to spend. just get the clutch kit. comes w/ clutch TO bearing,
 and pressure plate. someone can correct me, but as long as it's a 1600
 12v engine the flywheel should be the same spacing on the clutch
 bolts.

The flywheel is the same, but he has no way of knowing whether he has the
early or late clutch fork, throwout bearing, and pressure plate.  A '71 is
right on the changeover and although it came with the old style parts
these days there is no way to tell which parts have been installed.  You
need to pull the engine first.
