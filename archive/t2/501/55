the problem is the TO bearing changed.

I pulled the engine on my '71 to find that I had a pre-71 TO bearing (and 
bellhousing, I guess, although not necessarily tranny).

short answer: i don't think there's any way to tell what year your tranny 
is based on the numbers stamped on it, and, if there were, it's 
always possible that you have a bellhousing from a different year on that 
tranny anyway.  

So I think you might be SOL, but I'm sure I'll be corrected if anyone 
knows better.  :)
