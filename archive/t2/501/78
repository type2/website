Subject: which carb?

I have a 914. 2L engine and we are having problems with the carb that is
currently on it.  What carb would someone suggest?  The one I have is a
Weber, don't remember which one, but it has been rebuilt, taken back off
again and reset and cleaned...but still having problems.. bus will not idle
like it should.  Also, this carb does not seem to have a vacuum port on the
front for the brakes, so the brakes takes the vacuum from under the air
cleaner.
Suggestions please for a better carb would be appreciated.
Thanks
