I hear ya, on the weekend my dad and I stayed up till 3 am in the heated
garage taking ends apart, removing film, corrosion and restraping them 
together
in various places. I think that might have been the problem with the 
selenoid for
the starter to. I haven't had that problem since but im keeping an eye open
for it too. I did a brief check in the bently and the hayes and didn't 
notice
that one saver circuit.  Is it in the ignition or elsewhere. I imagine some 
WD40
sprayed wouldn't hurt with the contacts being as old as they are.
