Don't forget that the temp markings on the thermostat (usually 75-80) are in
celsius degrees, not farenheit. The thermostat should be fully compressed if
the engine is cold, no matter where you live or what time of year. If the
stat is not tightly compressed on a cold engine it is bad, or perhaps the
cable is a bit too tight.
