Subject: looking for rubber alternator elbow cooling boot

Does anyone know where I can get one?  I have two and they're badly cracked.

This is the part number:
H.  021-903-655D  Elbow Boot, AL75X, 1975 to 1979  NLA
H.  022-903-655  Elbow Boot, AL108X, 1975 to 1979  NLA

for a picture: Bentley manual; Engine and Clutch; pg 21; part #4

thanks!
Mike
