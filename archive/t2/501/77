Subject: Re: [T2] STEEL DASH?

Hi Everyone,

Just wanted to tell you some things I have noted on
Steel dashboards the past few years. May be you find
it interesting:

- Padded dashboards are standard on the USA ever since
the T2 was introduced in august 1967. I heard this was
a result of a Ralph Nader trafficsafety law in january
1967, however I don't think the T1 was ever available
with a padded dashboard.

- The Padded dashboard is an option: M511 (see also
here: http://www.type2.com/m-codes/t2mc300.html)

- Padded dashboards only seem to have been available
in LHD, not RHD.

- the steel of the padded dashboard is very different
from the steel-only dash. The holes of all the
possible dashswitches are there plus there are many
other gaps in the steel.

- A steel dashboard is standard. Here in Europe I
think about 95% of the busses had a steel dash.

- The paint varies through the years:

modelyear 1968-1969 - the dash is painted in the body
colour! So a Velvetgreen bus had a Velvetgreen dash!
modelyear 1970-1973 - the dash is painted
greyish/black with a smooth surface
modelyear 1974-1979 - the dash has a non reflective
paint with a sort of 'pollution' of small grains in
it.

- when getting a steel or padded dash also watch out
you get the good dash since there are 3 different
ones, the difference is in the attachment of the
steering column. These years are interchangeable:

  1968-1969
  1970-1974
  1974-1979

The dashchange in 1974 was somewhere during the
modelyear.



If you have any more dashboard or US/European
specification questions let me know!

yours,
