glad you and your van are safely home, have a beer, takee a hot soak in
the tub, kick back and enjoy your own bed.

when you have a chance and have a few moments I know I for one would be
interested to know what worked and what caused problems, in getting
yourself back on the road.  and what got you going and what were the
hangups
  trying to help someone out on the road when you can not see the problem
or know the experience level of the person is extremely challenging.  I
know when giving you some advice I revised it several times trying to make
what I was saying clear when I had no feedback or knowledge of where you
were hung up.

in any case glad your home,

Bob
