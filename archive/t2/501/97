Subject: I broke down (not how you think)

Broke down and ordered some panels.

I have a rear right corner, right rear panel and complete sliding door rail 
assembly (since mines totally rusted to pieces). If I had more money I would 
also have bought more but this will fix the major stuff and the sliders 
needed the work bad.

Tune up next week and Im putting in Electronic Ignition in as well. Figure 
it will make it a little more reliable.

I hope my car gets fixed soon so i have something to drive :)

Im kinda happy to be getting rid of some of the rust.
