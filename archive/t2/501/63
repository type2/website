Subject: Need doghouse parts

My eleven month engine rebuilding project is stalled for need of : 

1) doghouse flap connecting rod and 

2) an adaptor for the left flaps that converts the two flap arms into one.

Can send picture of these parts from RAMVA site.

I would appreciate anyone that can help me purchase these items.

Thanks,
