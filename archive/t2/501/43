The steel dash lives underneath all that plastic on your dash!
Unfortunately, the plastic is molded or glued on so it's a pain to remove.

Some of the first Euro buses seemed to come with it.  If you look at the
pictures in the Bentley manual you'll see it.

You can convert a padded dash to steel by removing the plastic and foam
and then closing up all the holes that they put in the metal to help the
plastic adhere.
