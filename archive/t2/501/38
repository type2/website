I lived three years in Italy with temps like you mentioned.

I adjusted the thermostat per Bentley and Muir and all was well all year 
whether I was I snow skiing in the Abruzzi mountains or visiting the beach 
in the heat of August.

VW engineer's designed into enough throw in the flaps to close in the cold 
and open fully when hot. If your flaps won't fully close or open then the 
thermostat may be going bad or a lever might be bent.

Good luck!
