Subject: STEEL DASH?

Hey guys,

        I was looking in my VW Bus Custom book, and I noticed that some
of the busses in there had steel dashes (bay window busses). I noticed
that the dashes were basically identical to the rubber / plastic dash,
and that ALL the pieces from the rubber / plastic dash fit into the steel
dash with no problems. I'd REALLY REALLY REALLY like to have one in my
Bus. I assume however that these weren't common pieces in the US probably
for safety standards. If anyone has one for sale, I'd be interested in
purchasing it. (It needs to be Left hand drive).


Thanks!!

Todd
