Duanne,

Ya never lived where it gets hot have you?<grin>

Black is ***HOT***
Black is hard to maintain(polish/wax etc.)
Painting a car Black shows *every* body flaw!

How about almost any color, but with <eyebrows raised> racing stripes!

LOL what fun!

Better yet, give the kids some buses(paper) to color and then maybe let
them vote on each color?

Cheers, dave
