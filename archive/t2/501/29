Check the Bentley...The T2 has a battery saver circuit that keeps the
headlights from coming on or being left on without the key...That's the 
connection that doesn't seem or at least is intermittently being made...
And, as always, check the grounds that they're tight and clean...An aw-
ful lot of electrical problems (especially in older vehicles) are the result
of age and corrosion on the grounds... ;-(
