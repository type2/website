Subject: Adjusting flaps/thermostat when in a warm climate?

Hi All:

Looking through the archives I see that there is lots of discussion on
thermostats. What I have not seen is any advice on adjusting the
thermostat when living in a warm climate. I live in South Florida
without the benefit of any cold nights, so the thermostat is never fully
compressed.

How should I set up the flaps when I tighten the screw for the
thermostat cable when the air temperature is around 70-80F? I imagine
that I don't want them fully closed as this will delay and even stop
them from opening fully. The normal temps this time of year during the
day are between 70-80, and 60 at night.
