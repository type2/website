Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Balancing in VA/MD/DE

I've been building VW engines since I put myself through college in the
early 70's and the best thing you can do is buy yourself a nice set of
scales.  Today's digital scales are really nice and not too expensive.  I
balance the rods first, mark the weight on each, then weigh the pistons with
the pins and mark those too.  Matching the heaviest piston with the lightest
rod and so on I can get the sets matched very closely.  There may be a
little grinding on a rod or two, but you can really come close this way.  I
also put the two heaviest sets on either number 1 and 3 or 2 and 4 that way
they offset each other.

Many people have commented on how smooth my engines run, with a little time
and not much extra money involved.
