Subject: Part prices

I'm selling a bunch of random parts from my bus: front
grill, headlights, seats, sidemarker/taillights, stuff
like that.  I have absolutely no clue how to price
these.  I'm probably gonna post em on the samba.com so
keep an eye out if you need any of them.  But any help
anyone can offer, thanks alot.
