Subject: OEM Fog Lamps?

Sorry, I wanted to make a correction. In my e-mail I said that there were two evenly spaced drilled holes in the DASH, I actually meant to say BUMPER. In line with the headlights, I have a hole drilled on each side UNDER the bumper. It looks to me as if there were fog lamps installed. I wanted to know if they were original from the factory, or a user aftermarket. 

If they ARE original, where is a good place to get a new set?


Thanks!

Todd
