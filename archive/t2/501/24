Hey guys

Would anyone know something about a 71 bus..........I
have a wire coming out of the back in the engine
compartment through the wall where the gas tank is.
Its BLACK and its got a single plastic splitter that
is original vw from the looks of it. its just over
from where the wires come through from the underneath
and go to the voltage regulator and back to the
lights.
thanks
Rus
