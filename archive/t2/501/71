HP1 is the "racing" version of the PH8A.  I don't know how the HP1 rates, but
the regular Frams .. no thanks.  I've been using Auto Pride filters
(private-label Hastings) for a couple of years with no problems, before that
I was using Purolater but my "stash" ran out.  And there's always NAPA with
their relabeled Wix filters.
