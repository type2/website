Subject: Bus Paint Color

I am repainting my '73 Bay Window Station Wagon after making some needed
rust repairs.
So here's the rub...what color?
It is currently the original white over red. We're sticking with the white
for the top to match the interior steel.
But the red is so....well red.
The hottest contenders so far are royal blue (the forth one down on
busselecta.com) or yellow...Orange also has some standing.
This is my winter daily driver and will also be the carrier for when a group
of my kid's friends want to go somewhere.
So...the color must convey cool for the kids and masculinity for me...pink
is out.

So help me...what color would you recommend?
