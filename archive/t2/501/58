Subject: OEM Fog Lamps?

Hey guys,

    While repainting my front bumper this weekend, I noticed that it had TWO holes evenly spaced in the underside of the dash. I ASSUME that these holes were likely used to bolt a set of FOG lamps on. My Bus is a 1973, does anyone know if a set of factory fog lamps were ever an option with the Bus? These holes look professionally cut.

Thanks,

Todd
