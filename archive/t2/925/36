By my computations, (15/16) * 25.4 = 23.8125, or roughly 24mm = normal
sized oil pressure switch

and 1 1/16  (17/16)* 25.4 = 26.9875 or roughly 27mm

Isn't the castellated nut for the ball joints in the late bays roughly
27mm??  I think the 1 1/16 socket will fit the ball joint nuts and will find
some use on the bus, so don't be discouraged if the store does not honor
your return. (You did buy a six-point socket, right??)
