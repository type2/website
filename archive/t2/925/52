Subject: Re: [T2] clutch pedal question

In my back cabinet is a set of emergency items. One of them is a new  
(in sealed plastic bag) clutch cable.

I was told to NEVER leave home without it. And a fan belt. And  
ignition parts. And gaskets. And oil.

Doesn't take up much space, to be honest, and I am sure will save my  
bones somewhere down the line.
