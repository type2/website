Good Morning Volks,

Last night, my wife, children, and I went to Oklahoma State  
University for their annual homecoming festivities.  I am happy to  
say, one of the fraternity houses (Sigma Nu, I think) decorated their  
front lawn with a float type design (as floats for parades, but  
stationary) of a VW Splittie!  My kids immediately like this  
homecoming decoration the best (out of 12 or so).  Glad my kids have  
their priorities right!! (they are 5 and 2).  Have a stellar weekend.

(sorry for little "bus" content, but just had to share my excitement)

Peace,
David
