Subject: fuel injector seal dropped into intake

'78 2.0 F.I.
  My assistant (good that I can blame it on someone else) dropped a fuel injector seal into the intake. He "thinks" he may have vaccumed it out. However, the valve was open and methinks it may be stuck in the cylinder. If so, what are the repurcussions? Should I just start it and burn it up or might it cause some damage?
  Thanks!  -Chris
