Going up thru the gears, you clutch, put it in neutral,
release the clutch and get the rpm's to match the
speed of the next gear, then clutch and put it in 
gear...
Going down thru the gears is the same but you
bring the rpm's up before going into the next gear.

After you get the hang of it and either learn the
engine speed by ear or with a tach, you can dis-
pense with the clutch except for a dead start...

Matching the rpm's to the wheel speed puts the
least strain and wear on the synchros (if you've
got 'em...;-) 

However, if you've got a Wilson Preselector gear-
box, the procedure is quite different... ;-)
