Subject: Re: [T2] fuel injector seal dropped into intake

Do you still have the vacuum bag?  I'd tear through that thing and look 
if it's in there.  Otherwise that'll be a pain in the ass to take the 
head off just to get that piece out.

But still, how would it suck it through the intake?  The hole is smaller 
than the seal and you'd literally have to stuff it through there.  Plus, 
it would have to get by the valve as well.  Can you see down in there to 
see if anything is stuck behind the valve?

Or did it get sucked into the main intake and down through the intake 
runners?  But it would still probably get stuck behind the valve.  I'm 
not sure how much a valve opens, but I don't think it opens enough for 
that rubber piece to go through the head.  Anyone else know?!

Have you run the engine yet?  If not, that's good, cuz at least it 
hasn't melted it.  I'm guessing that would munge up the cylinder and 
rings.  You can also take off the intake runner for that side to peek 
down into the intake ports and see what you can find..

I can also look at my extra heads to see if a seal can really get 
through the valve into the cylinder when it opens if you want...
