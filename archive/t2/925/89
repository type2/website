 The frequent debate:  FI & Electronic Ignition versus
Carbs and Points.

That debate is solved in my state.  If your car is 75
or newer, it can't be EMISSIONS modified and still
pass the emissions tests.  Unless of course they don't
look carefully during the inspections every other
year.  :D

Not sure where you live, but if it is in California, it is 100% LEGAL to upgrade to electronic ignition. The
only drawback with using the 79 Cal electronic set-up is having to connect the retard side of the vacuum unit.
The correct way is to use the 79 throttle housing because it has a dedicated port for retard.
