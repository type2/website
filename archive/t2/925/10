Subject: Re: [T2] distributor drive gear backwards situation

Be sure that it REALLY is out 180 degrees first... <griN!>

Remove the distributor, remove the spring under that.

Go get a good #2 pencil, cut it off blunt (like a new pencil) and then 
shove it into the hole of the drive hard. Push it way in. Hopefully you 
can bottom it out without breaking it.

Now pull the drive out while allowing it to rotate (it will).

Now rotate it the right direction and put it back in. Remember the 
rotation so you need to rotate it slightly before you put it in. I can't 
tell you by memory which direction you need to rotate it, but trial and 
error will explain. Or you could buy the tool from any of the numerous 
VW suppliers. Or you could tap the hole so you could thread a bolt in 
which would be more reliable than the pencil but for me the pencil fits 
my budget. <griN!>

I got "published" in the Muir book with this bit of info in the GrabBag 
section in the back of the book.

Hope this helps.
