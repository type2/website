<<Which set up? Did B's still have 
chain drive and (Bull)dog clutches>>



I ain't that old---

AC Macks in the 30's & 40's had the chain drive back wheels.
They were big and popular when the Hoover Dam was built--and other heavy
earth moving jobs of the time.
They had an auxillary box--  a high and a low speed--and a main 5 speed
box.

Two stick B-Models started in the late 40's--ran till the late 60's.

Who's double clutching a Bus?
Why?
