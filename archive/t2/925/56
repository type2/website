Subject: Atlanta-area VW-focused machine shops

Though I've been reading the "dead engine - replace with..." posts with
great interest, being especially enticed by the BFY complete engine
deal, I still want to first try my hand at a home-rebuild.  I already
have a good used case, heads, crank, etc, so I might as well give it a
go and stretch my budget out a bit further.

Anyone know of a machine shop in the Atl area that they would
recommend?
Samba business listing notes one Atlanta shop:  "Northlake Service
Center"  www.vwga.com 
I suppose I'll go with them if no other names come up.
Thanks
Greg & his '71 Westy, Patience.
