I'll see what I can dig up. I have a bunch of pix of
beds from various buses in wrecking yard but virtually
no notes or dimensions. Give me a few days. Check my
sig for the link. I may just dump them into a new
album and not do any editing just to get them up
quicker.

I have also considered eliminating all the hinging
stuff and going to something like channels on each end
for the back cushion to slide into and some support
system that isn't a 5-second solution but maybe a
30-second solution where I actually have to lift
cushions and re-arrange individually, but what I have
now is nice - especially when I'm really tired! -BaH
