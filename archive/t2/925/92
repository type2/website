You could also use a late bus single vacuum advance canister on the CA
distributor - remove the CA dual can and swap an advance only can onto the
distributor. You need to verify your total advance and so forth after doing
this sort of swap. I've done similar swaps a few times and I usually try a
few vacuum canisters until I am happy with the amount of vacuum advance the
distributor is making.
