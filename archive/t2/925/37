Subject: Engine cut-out problem

All,

Just received the message below from my brother.  He has a 76 Westy and has 
been having some engine cut-out problems.  I searched the type2 library and 
archive and didn't see anything similar.  Anyone else have this problem? If 
so, what fixed it? He's planning on doing the basic stuff (connector checks, 
etc.), but since the cut-out problem seems to happen predictably then later 
the engine starts again, I'm thinking it's not wiring.

"It runs great and then suddenly just cuts out...on the freeway it just 
suddenly quit on me (which was pretty scary!) and I had to coast over to the 
shoulder.   I walked off the freeway to get a hamburger, and returned to 
check it out about 45 minutes later and it started right up.
This pattern was repeated all the way back home, that is it would run fine 
for a period of time and then just cut out, only to start up again after 
approximately 45 minutes.  A friend thinks it has to do with the electrical 
wiring, what are your thoughts. "

Anything helps...

Thanks,

Bob
