Hi Phil.  I'm going to do just that with a 2.0.  What kind of  heads and jugs did you buy?  Any other advice?  I've just got  the engine but the heads or cylinders had been robbed off of it.   And what kind of engine stand will I need?  A buddy of mine says  the one he uses for the beetle motors won't hold it.  Thanks...KR

response, but I put my engine together with solid
lifters and a hydraulic cam and it runs just fine.
That is in a 1.8L with 009, webber progressive. can't
tell any difference in power or response. I have been
told by some other people, that to go the other
way,(solid cam/hyd lifters)that it would not work as
well, I don't know, the slope is sharper on the solid
cam, might wear quicker, but who knows, try it and let
us know what happens.  Phil
