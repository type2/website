I put up a quickie web site where I will record progress on the 
turbodiesel conversion.  There are a few pictures, hopefully more to 
come if I can find the time.  This site is hosted out of my closet and 
so may be down from time to time, if the weather is bad or the kid is 
downloading MP3s.  :-)

Thanks to all that have contributed with advice, parts and most 
importantly, support (all of which has been positive thus far).  I am on 
my way.
