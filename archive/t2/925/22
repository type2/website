Subject: Re: [VB] Bay Z-bed in a 60

I'm certainly not the smartest guy in the world, but would it also work, 
rather than altering, (and maybe weakening) the Z-Bed frame, to experiment 
with different thicknesses of foam on the back of the cushion to get to 
the level you want?

Is this a Westy Z-bed?  I have a Sundial, and it seems that the important 
level to consider is does the cushion back, when the bed is extended, come 
up to the same level as the cushion that last on the shelf over the 
engine?

Would it work to make the back cushion on the Z-bed either thicker or 
thinner so that it aligns with the cushion over the engine?

Just a thought.  Seems that if this would work, it would be a lot easier 
than cutting and making the Z-bed frame either shorter or taller.
