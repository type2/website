actually I'm incorrect. I was talking about the ability to force a 
distributor down hard enough that the gear and bottom of the distributor 
will actually make contact and work. However it puts a lot of stress on 
the assembly. It can be done (as I have done it), but it requires some 
quite out of tolerance parts (as I had).

I had never considered just rotating the bottom of the distributor 
shaft, I bet that is much easier than trying to pull out the gear. cool 
trick.
