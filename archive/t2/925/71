I love getting my monthly tool porn from Sears, Eastwood, etc...

My wife doesn't dare throw that away.

  Next time you're at Sears or on their website, sign up for the Craftsman
Club.  You'll get a
  membership card, along with a flyer about once a month with "specials" only
available to members.


  The flyer is usually about 20 pages of different tools (hand tools, socket
sets, pretty much a
  random assortment of anything in the tool department) that are offered to
club members at some
  discount level, anywhere from 10% to 50%.

  It's not a bad deal, especially since it's free.  I'm sure you'll be able to
find at least one
  thing you can't live without each month.
