I asked this question a while back, didn't get any
response, but I put my engine together with solid
lifters and a hydraulic cam and it runs just fine.
That is in a 1.8L with 009, webber progressive. can't
tell any difference in power or response. I have been
told by some other people, that to go the other
way,(solid cam/hyd lifters)that it would not work as
well, I don't know, the slope is sharper on the solid
cam, might wear quicker, but who knows, try it and let
us know what happens.  Phil
