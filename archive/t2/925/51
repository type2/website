Double clutching allows you to downshift faster.  If you want an extreme 
example of how it helps, try going 20 in second gear, press the clutch, 
and see if you're bus will downshift into first.  You will have to hold 
pressure on the shifter (keeeeep holding) and you will hear the gears 
spool up and then eventually fall in after a few seconds - takes a while.

With double clutching, you help it along.  You press the clutch to take 
it out of gear (which isn't really needed unless you're really loading 
them), then you release the clutch and rev the engine, then you press 
the clutch again and downshift.  This helps synchronize the gears, or at 
least get them closer.
