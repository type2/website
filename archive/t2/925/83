<<Nothing can be more frustrating than a non fuctional AFC system--->> 

<<True but why does it have to be that way...>>

That's why I mentoned it Richard--
If it's true--forget about it.

 <<Why are we always comparing a set of (new) dialed in carbs to a
malfunctioning FI setup?>>

No,
Lets do this;
Compare a screwed up FI system, and a screwed up points, condensor, carb
system.

They both happen to stop dead on the side of the road in the same place
, the same time.

I'll file the points, saftey wire my choke open, and be down the road
while your still scratching your head why you have no go.

<<Just go over the parts, testing them, fixing the PO and his mechanic
abuses, make sure the electrical contacts are good and you'll find it's
reliable.>>

Like I said--your still on the side of the road--I'm gone.

I think I'll trade the hour or two a year to keep the earlier system
running right, than to be suprised and on the cell phone calling AIRS or
the tow truck--


<<The points and condenser are not part of the FI system.>>

Right again--
Thanks for understanding that.

<<I have no fear of driving 2,000 miles in my bus because I've put in
the effort to make sure a 30 yr. old bus is road worthy enough to get me
to the destination and back.>>

Good One .

This is the kinda stuff the travel agent was telling the folks that went
for their first boat ride on that unsinkable ship.---

They had no fear either---

Glug----
