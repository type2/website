Subject: Re: [VB] Bay Z-bed in a 60

Well - actually - the z-bed I'm using has had huge speaker holes cut into it 
by the PO. In the past I covered the base of the z-bed with masonite and 
painted it - it looked OK - but now I plan on changing the entire board - so 
... since I'm changing the board anyway I figured I might just as well 
replace the side boards and alter the size of the z-bed.

In the past ... I had the original foam on the 74 z-bed recovered with brown 
vinyl - looked OK - and I had a thinner foam covered with matching fabric 
over the engine bay ... but it wasn't perfect - it wasn't near as 
comfortable as the bed in my 78.  I suppose it could have been better if I 
had played with foam of different densities - like maybe a higher density 
foam over the engine bay ... but ... since those huge speaker holes are in 
the base of the z-bed .. and since I'm replacing that board .. and since I 
have to replace the foam on the bottom of the 74 z-bed because it is 
breaking down ... why not just make the z-bed such that I can use the same 
thickness annd density of foam on the z-bed and over the engine bay.

jdd (not the smartest guy either)
