Subject: speculate with me

i realize that you may only be able to speculate on this
situation.thankyouin advance
I have a 78 2.0L bus , that originally i assume had a 091 6 rib, i purchased
this bus 3 weeks ago , and its got a 3 rib with the SHORTER
STARTER,presumably a PO had replaced the 091 with the 3 rib. now, this
transmission is messed up badly, so i bought another 6 rib 091.
please elaborate on these points for me. im hoping i can use my same starter
since i am broke from buying parts

1 a P.O. left the 228mm flywheel in , left in the 091 clutch housing and
added the 002 tranny
using the 215mm clutch and such

2  P.O put in 002 trans and bellhousing , exchanged the 228mm flywheel for
the smaller 002 and used the 215mm clutch assembly

3 best case ( i hope this is it) P.O. left 228mm  flywheel  clutchplate and
assembly, 091 bellhousing and just added an 002 onto it?
 thank you joe
