Actually, it's a pretty easy job, not more than a few minutes work.  What 
gives it its PITA reputation is that it's hard to breathe with your heart in 
your throat while you envision dropping and tearing down the engine if you 
screw up.

That said, I've done it 3 times with no problems, so this might be a case 
where your worst fears make it seem like more of a problem than it really 
is.
