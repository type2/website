Subject: 1600 down to a 1200?

I bought a 70 Westfalia with a dead 1600 in it, my uncle found a 1200cc for
me to use until I can get the 1600 rebuilt.

I realize it's a small motor for a heavy bus, however, I was wondering if
the swap is possible?

Anyone happen to know if the rear crossmember lines up? its quite a bit
narrower to my eye.

Cheers
