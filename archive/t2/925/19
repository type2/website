Subject: Bay Z-bed in a 60

So ... if you laid a 2 x 4 in the inside of your bus - on the top of the 
engine bay running front to back - then measured from the bottom of the 2 x 
4 to the floor (the top of one of the ripples in the floor) - what would the 
measurement be in a) a bay window bus and b) a split window bus. I don't see 
that measurement in my 63 to 67 Bentley.  I'm trying to alter a bay window 
bus z-bed such that if fits in a split window bus.  I want the top of the 
plywood in the z-bed to come to exactly the same level as the inside top of 
the engine bay.
