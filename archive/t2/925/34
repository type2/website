Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] Bay Z-bed in a 60

I put a bay westy Z-bed in my '61 15 window.   It bolted right in to the rear 
seat places with the T bolts.   No alteration was needed.  (apart from 
cutting the bottom of the bed to clear the heater log in the back of the bus, and I 
took the door off to let the heat into the bus as well)  (If your 60 is a 
kombi, you won't need to do that)
