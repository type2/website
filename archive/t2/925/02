These "Mexico new crate motors" you speak of...
  Is there a way to easily distinguish these 'all new' Meximotor
longblocks from other less-than-reputable 'all-new' longblocks available
from various vendors?   Who's got the real thing?  Who's got the
BeetleMex/GEX knock-off?

Looking in the archives has been both enlightening and confusing.   I
can't quite figure out if the solid lifter Meximotors come with dished,
flat or domed pistons.   
  aircooled.net tech help says all solid lifter blocks come with domed
pistons
  old volks home site says dished pistons come on the new mexican
motor
  Bus Depot - product page doesn't say

The only odd failures I've seen with mine is one broken cylinder stud.
I've heard of one other person who had this problem.  I don't know if
this
was a metallurgy or torque problem, but it was sure a shocker when I
pulled the valve cover to adjust the valve and saw that stud hanging
out!

If I had it to do again, I'd still buy a Meximotor, but I would pull
the
cylinder studs and replace them with known good German studs.  It's
easy
before you install the engine in the bus.
