Well, it's Christmas early for me.  I've been ogling the 261 piece  tool set with a nice 4-drawer tool chest (at Sears) for some  time.  It's normally $269.99 but I've seen it on sale for  $199.  Well today they had it down to $188 and I couldn't  resist.  Maybe now I won't misplace my tools as much.  Here's  a link if you're interested:
