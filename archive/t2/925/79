Tool Manager?

The last time I bought another 13 mm socket and 10 mm combination
wrench at Sears, the guy who was ringing up my order tried to scan my
stuff WITH THE STAPLER!

The nose breathing Gen whatever kept dragging the STAPLER across the
package. When he couldn't figure out why he didn't see the price on
his screen and why I was laughing so hard, he looked down and
mumbled, "uhhh, yeah, ok!"

I hope he wasn't the Tool Manager!
