It's been a really long time, but do I recall
correctly that the shaft is at an angle? And this is
the primary cause of concern for where the washer
might fall? What if you jacked up that side of the
vehicle enough to level it out? Is that even possible?
Just a thought, but it looks like Jamie's got it
figured out regardless. -BaH
