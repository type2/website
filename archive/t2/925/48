No, shouldn't be a problem.  The clutch mechanicals
can travel that far.

Frequent clutch cable failures at the clutch actuating
arm could be caused by electrolytic-induced
corrosion...if your tranny-frame grounding strap is
missing, frayed, or corroded the clutch cable might
end up as the next-best conduction path for the ground
to the engine! The resulting current can cause rapid
corrosion.

This is something I've always wondered.. If the clutch
fully engages
before the pedal hits the floor, but you keep going,
is there a risk
of damage?


I'd always been taught to always floor the clutch
pedal to preserve
the clutch disc (keep it from wearing out).
