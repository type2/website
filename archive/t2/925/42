Check the double relay and the ballast resistor.  Been
there, Done That.  Also check ignition switch.  Do you
have a lot of keys on your ring.  Classic symptom. 
Could also be a bad coil.  Warms up and shuts off.

Start with the ignitions switch.  Is there power at
the coil and distributor?

Is there power to the fuel pump. (Double relay)

Are the injectors squirting  (ground and ballast
resistor)

Is there spark at the spark plugs (coil, ignition
wires (check ohms), rotor and cap, etc
