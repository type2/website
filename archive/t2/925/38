Hi Bob,

Agreed, it's not likely to be wiring. It's much more likely to be  
fuel system related.

1. Make sure the fuel tank is properly vented. If air can't get in to  
replace the fuel being used, the end result will be precisely as  
described. When it stalls out have him open the filler cap. If air  
suddenly rushes in, you have found the problem.

2. It could also be an overheating fuel pump. If the filter is  
blocked up with crud the pump will overheat. When it cools down it  
would work OK again. Check the fuel filter ASAP.


Happy Trails,
