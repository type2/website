Next time you're at Sears or on their website, sign up for the Craftsman Club.  You'll get a
membership card, along with a flyer about once a month with "specials" only available to members. 


The flyer is usually about 20 pages of different tools (hand tools, socket sets, pretty much a
random assortment of anything in the tool department) that are offered to club members at some
discount level, anywhere from 10% to 50%.

It's not a bad deal, especially since it's free.  I'm sure you'll be able to find at least one
thing you can't live without each month.
