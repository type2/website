Subject: [T2] Roof Rack

but why the bow - and the pieces to which the end of the bowed piece 
attach - why would they go up higher than the rest of the rack? The pieces 
that run front to back on the bottom look like they might have been cut - 
but the pieces that run front to back on the sides show no signs of being 
cut ... hmmmm ... and the diagonal support pieces on the sides - there are 
no signs that other diagonal support pieces have been cut off ...

either way - i don't understand the function of the bow at one end - 
although - if you had another identical to it ... might be handy for 
carrying ... not sure what.

Anyone know why this roof rack (2nd pic:

>> It looks like a VWOA rack that has been cut in half. The triangulation of
>> the supports also looks like a modification done after the fact.
