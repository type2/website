They're in Long Beach, CA - close to CSULB. I'm not in a big hurry - but 
it's be nice to see them go to someone who will use 'em. I'll go get the 
serial #'s... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...

O.k., here we go:
the only serial # I found was on the cabinet beneath the z-bed. Label reads:

Westfalia Werke-K-G
Campmobile 70, (serial # stamped): 9 04126

looks similar to this one,

but the clothes closet I have appears to be 1/2 as tall. The rubber/plastic 
trim is black, not white. Insides of the z-bed cabinet and behind the panel 
is a waffle-weave white vinyl.

Oh yeah, label on the panel says:
"Fix table on top of the motor while driving" in German, English, then 
Spanish??-can't remember. I'm all about multi-tasking, but how do ya pull 
that one off?

here's a link w/some pics to someone who sold a "westfalia campmobile 70":
