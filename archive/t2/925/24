Buy or borrow a mechanical gauge and test it with that, it will eliminate all of the potential electrical problems that could be interfering with your current gauge.

They are a handy tool, after you check out your oil pressure keep it as a diagnosis tool, I like to keep one mechanical oil pressure gauge handy, hooking it up is the first thing I would do if I was questioning oil pressure on any motor.
