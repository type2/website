Or - you could figure out a way to drain off about a
quart+ and put in a quart of Power Punch or Hilton Hy
Per Lube or even a quart of straight SAE60 oil and see
if there's a significant change with slightly thicker
oil. If so, it pretty much indicates rebuild time...
but I got by running straight 50 or 60 for a couple
years! I always use the HyPerLube or Power Punch (same
product / different labels.) -BaH

BTW - a turkey baster works really well for sucking
out oil, but you'll prolly have to add a short hose
extension to it. (available at Safeways everywhere!)
