Subject: window problem

Hey, guys.  I'm on my way to see my nephew play football last  night and roll the window down.  When I try to roll it up,  nada.  It's completely stuck.  I'll tear into it today to  figure it out.  I can put those new tools to use.  Anybody  else run into this?  Cheers...KR
