The best collection of vintage adverts that I've ever seen are in  
Richard Copping's two books, "The Aircooled Era in Colour" and "VW  
Bus -- 40 Years of Splitties, Bays and Wedges." Both available from  
Veloce Publishers in the UK. Expensive, but easily the best  
collection. <http://www.veloce.co.uk>
