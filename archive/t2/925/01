I think the lift is the same but the duration is different.  I found

There was another article that I read that confirmed the above for the 
type4 engine, but I can't find it.

Now, does that mean you'll notice any difference, who knows.  Karl says 
he's been running interchanged setups for a while without any ill effects.
