I don't have a distributor drive gear on hand, but does the gear have a 
hole in it into which you could stick a bent-end pick or something to 
hold the washer in place as you pull it up?  I'll have to pull mine out 
tonight and take a look at the gear - on my bench engine, of course ;)

Another trick is to put the washer around a large screwdriver and insert 
the screwdriver and then drop the washer down the shaft.
