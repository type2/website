Yikes. From what i've been told by various engine
builders (i too asked this a while back) & it is
mentioned in the book "building aircooled vw engines"
(the redish/pink one), you can not put solid lifters
on a hydraulic cam. It wasn't the lobe profile, but
the hardness of the lobes. Apparently, the solid
lifters are harder metal than the hydraulic lobes,
causing premature cam death!
