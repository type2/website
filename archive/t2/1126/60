 They are not allen heads on my van's CVs - they're splined heads - same in
the new german CV kit I bought. Check out the tool you need here (its not a
torx head): "Splined Socket" just over half way down page:

I had a similar issue - I took the angle grinder, chopped them off, pulled
the CV joints and used vice grips to free the bolts afterwards - like
already advised - they came out easy that way (be careful not to grind the
washer otherwise you'll have to get new ones of those - not in kit -
although i did find a lot of different modern VW CV washers fitted),. You
can always grind the bolt shaft a little square to get a really good grip.

Have fun!
