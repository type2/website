Subject: "dizzy" help?

Hi, I have here a 1.8 Litre Canadian 'carbed" engine , which I have totally
rebuilt with some 'mods'...that is not the 'issue'!  However, I have also, a
'Dizzy' with petronixs,  with vacuum advance, and I have installed a 'double
output" oil pressure 'sensor', so I could have 'gauge pressure', as well as
'light'!  Now, I have a problem, with 'interface', on the "vacuum can", and
oil pressure sender location!  If I 'see' the mark for the stock TDC, on the
distributor  base, can I 'turn' the stock housing, to clear the 'contact
point" with  the old mark, keep the 'contact' for the rotor, and just 'mark'
the 'new' point, as cylinder #1?  I realize that "number 1" was supposed to be
"first on firing"!  Sorry If I don't make sense..at 64 years of
age...everything seems difficult!
Cheers
Sys
