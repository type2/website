sometimes you can get a Dwell meter , and a timing light combo for a good
deal!... if you run points,, a dwell meter is a big item to have.... as you
can set the points to 50 deg... and the engine runs great.. and you can set
them to 16 thou,, and it runs like crap...

me,,, I never use a feeler gage.. always a dwell meter.


Is foreign Aid Auto still around albque?
