One thing to remember is that, even though all of our busses left the factory
with splined, tri-square, or whatever you want to call the bolts, not all of
them still have them.B  You will need to clean them out to make sure of what
you have.B  My '72 Westy had splined and allen bolts when I bought it.B  It
has all splined on it now.



Also, I would recommend filing a flat edge on opposite side of the bolt then
using a vice-grips on it.B  The flat sides will give better grip.

I use a splined tool that is not a socket, but a six sided tool that one
can place a socket over, or in my case, a long wrench held near the base
where the splines start. B As you apply torque, tap with a small sledge
at the same time so you don/t risk twisting the splines out of the hole.
B B I don't advise using the bolts over again, as the splines within the
bolt can flatten a bit. B If you have the socket, use a flex handle to
shorten the lever effect and tap on the 90 degree bend. B One issue not
mentioned is the area to work in is tight- I jack up the wheel, turn it
until I have the bolt in the right place, and slip a piece of firewood
under the wheel to hold it.
