Do you have access to an air compressor and spray gun?

I find that the primer out of rattle cans to be pretty thin stuff. It 
has to be so the pressurized can is able to push the primer or paint 
out. For small pieces that I can primer or paint several coats rattle 
cans are good. For anything else I'd recommend a spray gun. You can 
shoot thicker paint, it's going to be cost effective if you have one or 
can borrow one rather than a case of rattlecan paint. The heavier primer 
makes life easier because you can cover more per coat and end up with a 
smoother coat of paint.

I bought a big 60 gallon Morgan upright compressor for $350 new. With a 
warranty. It is a factory reman that started life as a 
Campbell-Hausfield. Is also sold as a Lowe's Hardware Kobalt brand. I 
did not shop smaller compressors but I suspect you can get a good "hot 
dog compressor" (horizontal tank) for cheaper than that. My gun is a $75 
dollar Campbell-Hausfield gun that is pretty good for my needs. There 
are much better guns of course.

If you don't have access to a compressor rig, watch Craigslist.

How close are you to middle TN?
