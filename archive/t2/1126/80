I had a lurch also, In my case it seems as though the whole engine did one
big skip, It was suggested to me that I use zipties to hold the afm plug,
dual relay and voltage regulator to their counterparts, viola! lurch be
gone.
this was after a year of searching and frustration. if I were you Id take
this advice.
also check the ohms on the coil and if yer points were dwelled at 30, get a
new set.they are most likely shot. Joe
