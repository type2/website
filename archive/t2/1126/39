John,, it isn't that hard to do.    set up the points by eye.. or I have
found my thumbnail ,, or a match book cover to be about the right
thickness.. or start with the feeler gage...    but don't snug up the point
screw. Just touch it down enough to hold the points

put the dist back in the engine.. and use your remote starter button to spin
the engine over.. no ignition required.. the cap isn't on anyway.. so it
won't run.

while the engine is spining on the starter.. you can read the dwell meter...
bang on 50..  you're done!
if it is less... or more .. then slide in the screwdriver between the
adjusting bumps and the slot in the points, give them a tweak open,, or
closed... and see that you got closer to 50  or futher away..

if you got closer.. tweak them again... till you hit 50
if you got further away... tweak them the other way till you hit 50

tighten that point screw,, put the rotor back in.. lol.. cap and wires.. go
for a relaxing drive...
