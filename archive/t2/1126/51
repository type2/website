Hi Volks,

I have found that cutting a slot in the head with a dremel will allow you
to turn a stripped out allen bolt with a large screwdriver. I think the
heat and vibbration of the cutting also helps loosen the bolt.

That, or I just squeeze a set of vice grips on it as hard as possible...
once the allen head deforms (ie, squishes flat) enough you can get some
decent torque into it and it will usually spin. Getting the vicegrips
loose afterward can be hard on the palms though.

Happy Trails,
