Thanks for the thoughts David.

I've had a lot of the same thoughts that you are talking about,
without actually having direct experience with it.

This bus has three coats of paint on it. It started as completely
orange. Then someone changed it to the two tone green and white, with
white interior. Then it got the purple paint.

Where I've been working at it with a wire wheel and paint thinner, the
orange and white seem really tenacious. The white softens when soaked
overnight in thinner, though, but dries hard again. There are small
spots where the interior purple is flaking off the white, but it is
mostly holding well, but as you say, this coat is extremely thin, and
since it dissolves immediately on wiping with thinner, I'm afraid of
the effect you are talking about of wrinkling or other adverse effect
when top coated.

All this means the job is getting bigger and bigger with each
advancing phase. A couple of times I've nearly thrown in the towel to
let a pro finish it, but that is not financially an option right now.

Taking the whole bus down to metal makes this a much, much bigger job
than I wanted to get into, but I may be forced to bite the bullet to
do it right. It means a big budget for stripper too, as I know a can
doesn't go very far.

I also didn't want to go down to metal because I don't think a repaint
is as good a protection as the original factory paint. Also, I know
the metal is going to start to rust before I get it painted.

This is getting me really stressed. The indecision has gotten the part
that I already wire wheeled the rust off of starting to rust again as
I have suspended work for a few weeks while I try to figure this out!

Well, 'nuff said for now!

John
