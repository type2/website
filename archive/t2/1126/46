The regulator maintains a constant fuel pressure _relative to manifold 
pressure_, which is why the vacuum line is there. If you don't have the 
vacuum line connected, it will be constant relative to atmospheric 
pressure. Since the manifold is always lower pressure (i.e. under a 
partial vacuum) than atmospheric, the fuel pressure will be too high. 
Way too high at idle, a little too high at wide open throttle.
