Another suggestion...I have used a torx socket to remove rounded out allen 
bolts in the past. Gently hammer the appropriately sized torx (I think the 
correct size is M8) 1/2" drive socket into the rounded out hole in the allen 
bolt and I always get enough bite to turn it out. I had to do this with some 
pulley bolts on an old VW Golf (I think you call it the VW Rabbit over 
there) and it worked very nicely.
