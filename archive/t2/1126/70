Oh yippee! Can you get me on with your new job in Paris!!!

About VW dealers - most don't have anyone that can work on our stuff
anymore, but since you are fuel injected, and have a lot in common
with Vanagons, you might be lucky. For plan B follow Greg's advice on
the shop locator. I don't really know any shops in that area other
than Ronnie at Bustoration in Lake Havasu. He is largely splitty
oriented, but is branching out into bays. Don't know if he's up on
fuel injection.

Well, best of luck to you!

John
