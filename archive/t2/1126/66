I use a splined tool that is not a socket, but a six sided tool that one 
can place a socket over, or in my case, a long wrench held near the base 
where the splines start.  As you apply torque, tap with a small sledge 
at the same time so you don/t risk twisting the splines out of the hole. 
  I don't advise using the bolts over again, as the splines within the 
bolt can flatten a bit.  If you have the socket, use a flex handle to 
shorten the lever effect and tap on the 90 degree bend.  One issue not 
mentioned is the area to work in is tight- I jack up the wheel, turn it 
until I have the bolt in the right place, and slip a piece of firewood 
under the wheel to hold it.
