I once put a donated Porsche engine into a 72 bus. Was told it was a
good one, but after I got it in, it was loud! Turned out to be a hole
burned through the head under the valve seat.

It wasn't until I received the stock replacement head that I found out
that the engine had oversize P&Cs. I don't remember how much they were
oversized, but a local VW machine shop flycut the head to match the
old one.

I had dual Dellortos and a Mallory dizzy on that engine. I have to say
that driving that bus was the first time I ever felt like I was
driving a bus with the power of a modern van.
