Latest update: the fun doesn't stop...

Left Santa Fe this morning, and the engine ran great until right
before the I-25 onramp, where it suddenly quit. Did a hose fall off?
Tighten one that seemed suspicious and headed to O'Reilly for
something similarly L-shaped with a 22mm inside diameter. Engine ran
fine and we made it to Albuquerque, where I bought a dwell meter and a
timing light. Dwell was only at 30 degrees, so the gap was a bit too
wide, but I decided not to bother changing that, considering how hot
the parts had gotten after sitting for 30 minutes. Just adjusted
timing, which was too advanced:  I presume that this is consistent
with theory: as dwell is reduced, timing is advanced.

From there we pushed westbound. Unfortunately, "Miss Daisy" was still
running hot and we had to keep it at 45 mph to keep oil temp under
250F. Sure there was an incline and a 13 mph head wind, but top end
power was very much subpar.

I suspect a lean mix is the cause of all these troubles. Maybe the
fuel pump is as gummed up as the rest and simply does not generate the
flow and pressure needed at higher speeds. Until I can measure fuel
pressure, I'm simply gonna switch out the ECU since I have a spare.

We are now at Red Rock Park, about 200 miles short of our planned stop
in Flagstaff. We'll get up early in the morning and hope to make it
there in time for brunch.

Cheers,
Sami
