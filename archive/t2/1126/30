Quick update for the curious:

1. connect vacuum to fuel pressure regulator, replaced the fuel hoses
(no, it's not the proper 7.5mm, which was nowhere to be found, but
5/16"=7.9mm; call me McGyver), fuel filter, syphoned the collected
fuel back into the tank. Crank engine, starts, putters, and stalls.
Repeatedly.

2. Because I'm at a loss for an explanation, I turn to something else
and replace the condenser. Have to pull the dizzy to get to the
screws. Have a closer look at the points and the gap looks real small.
Don't have a feeler gauge, but replace with a different set of points
and condenser from my parts box.

Result: engine runs beautifully!

Conclusion: I'm not sure, but it appears that the combination of
marginal fuel delivery, marginal ignition parts add up to lots of
problems.

Tomorrow: test drive to Albuquerque, where I'll buy a feeler gauge and
a timing light for a more precise adjustment. Then on to AZ!
