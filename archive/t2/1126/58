For lean running I'd look at vacuum leaks first. That's serious stuff
because if head temps are pushing up the oil temps, the head may
already be in the danger zone. I guess this bus is going to a new
owner, but always travel with a CHT on your own air-cooled VW.

 power was very much subpar.

 fuel pump is as gummed up as the rest and simply does not generate the
 flow and pressure needed at higher speeds. Until I can measure fuel
 pressure, I'm simply gonna switch out the ECU since I have a spare.
