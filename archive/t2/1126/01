Sami,

The even 100psi as you describe it sounds a little weak.  60psi on the 
first stroke in particular.  Not fatally weak by any means, but, let's 
say "marginal".  Might want to check your cranking voltage, it should be 
at least 10V.  If not, your compression results are likely skewed.  Swap 
batteries.  :-)  I would agree that the valves are probably doing their 
jobs, this points more to the rings.  If you didn't add some oil to the 
cylinder to see if the compression comes up, you might try that next 
time it's convenient.

The oil temp spike is strange - if it happened within a few seconds, 
it's almost certainly an electrical glitch with the gauge since I can't 
imagine any reason the oil would get so hot so quickly.  If it took a 
few minutes, well... the only thing that comes to mind is a bunch of 
excess fuel being dumped into the engine by the injectors.  That might 
go along with the other problems you were seeing but I would expect you 
to smell gas and/or see gas coming out the tailpipe in that case.

I'm sorry but I don't know how to check an ignition coil - my method of 
troubleshooting is to swap it out with a known good one.  They almost 
never die anyway, much more likely that it is a bad condenser on your 
dizzy.  If you have a spare one of those, you might try swapping it (I 
saw a whole spare dizzy in your parts stash, maybe just swap the whole 
thing?).  Since I am not an FI guy, I'll have to defer to others on that.

Good luck and keep us posted,

-David
