Subject: Re:rear sway or front sway...

Yeah I have mixed the tires. The reason being that the front tires were in
really bad shape, the rear tire looked fine. I didn't have the money at the
time to put new ones on the rear as well. I kind of forgot I had two
different types on there. Actually, I just took a look again.the front end
has disc brakes, so different rims than the rear which has drum. I don't
think I can just swap tires easily-without bringing it to a shop to have
them swap the tires and rims.

 

How can you tell by the numbers I have you that one has a higher load
rating? I thought those number just gave you size?

Swap those around; if you're going to mix-and-match tires (which you
probably shouldn't do...) put the higher-load-rated tires on the rear axle.
Partly because there's more weight in the back than the front, mostly
because having "softer" tires in the back
