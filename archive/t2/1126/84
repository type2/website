Subject: confounded oil leak!

2.0L GE FI engine...
 
less than 1000 miles on it since rebuild and has developed a nasty oil leak
that I can't figure out where it's coming from!  I've read all the archives
and was wondering if anyone had any tale-tale signs which would point to the
fan hub seal vs. the oil sending unit vs. the oil cooler etc.  I took the fan
off and ran it briefly and the fun hub seal looks dry.  The rubber booty thing
that covers the oil sending unit was full of oil and there's oil sprayed all
over the engine compartment and dripping off the entire bottom of the engine. 
is there anything that i've described which should point me one way or the
other?  thanks much.  greg
