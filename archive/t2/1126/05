Hi everybody,

Thanks for the speedy replies!
John suggested spark plug induced pre-ignition. I removed all spark
plugs before the compression test and they all looked fine, clean and
grey. I replaced them anyway with new ones.

Bob suggested I check the fuel pump and replace the fuel filter. I
will go ahead and do that. In fact, the fuel filter goes back to my
carburated 911 installation. So its old.

David thinks that 100 psi is low and I agree. I should add the caveat
that my first reading on cylinders 1 and 4 was only 80. On those I had
used an extension to the compression hose. I then repeated the test
without the extension and got the 100 psi result to match cylinders 2
and 3. My point is that the compression tester might not have been
fully tight (although I got it in as tight as I could).

When I wrote that the oil temp went up suddenly, I only meant to say
that it had gotten up since the last time I had checked, maybe 5
minutes earlier.

Fuel smell? Maybe. I did smell fuel, but wasn't sure if it was my bus
or some other car or old pickup driving by. And it dissipated quickly.

Ok, I checked the air flow sensor with my cheapo Radioshack
multimeter: terminals 36 and 39 (switch to fuel pump at start up) are
fine. Terminals 8 & 7: 300 Ohm (should be between 120 and 200),
terminals 6 & 9: 600 Ohm (should be between 200 and 400). Since the
readings were outside published specs, I repeated the test on an
identical unit in my box of spares and got the exact same readings, so
there's no point in swapping them. The flap moves smoothly, no problem
there. Had a peak under the cover: nice and clean.

That's all I got for now. Time for breakfast!

Sami
