Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [OVT] 34pict3 Carburetor issue

I agree with Mark, I've had carbs that looked absolutely fine, blew them out 
with air, re-installed and still ran like crap. Took all the jets out, 
everything got soaked including whole carb in Berrymans Carbcleaner dip can, 
washed it all out under water, then blew everything clean with air again; 
carb ran like a dream. Hard to believe a little bit of a dirt particle can 
do that, but it can.
