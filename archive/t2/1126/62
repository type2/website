Wouldn't that risk damaging the bearings of the axle hub?

Weld an 18" piece of rebar to it. Give it sudden twist so that the bolt 
breaks loose. I always use a small tube 18" long with my allen or torx 
wrenches so I get that cheater bar effect. Bar flexes so that it "pops" 
the cv joint bolts loose. Other methods include using my largest vice 
grips and really, really clamp them on to the bolt head.My smaller vice 
grips just flex too much so the larger pair are a must. I have clamped 
them on so hard it took two of us to squeeze them shut.

I liked the earlier suggestions to just grind the head off and then 
remove the rest of the bolt after the CV joint is removed.
