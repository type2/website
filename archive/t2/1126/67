Leaving a fuel injected vehicle for months is difficult unless someone 
can run it weekly;  gas stabilizer only works a few months and the gas 
still degrades but won't gum up.  Draining it and letting it run dry 
will help (after stabilzer is added), but then the fuel tank can rust 
from air exposure.  The pressure regulator also can freeze; I had this 
happen and had injector/cold start injector blow out issues.
