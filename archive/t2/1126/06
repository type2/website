Subject: Oil Filler grommet?

I am looking for the grommet that goes around the oil fill tube and the engine
tin on a 78 2.0 FI.

The one that is on there is so brittle and broken that I can't make out the
numbers.

I have searched on busdepot.com and some others and have not had any luck.

Does anyone have a way to find that number and/or know a place that sells
them?

Thanks!

Jeremy
