Exactly - so when you're decelerating hard, vacuum increases in the 
manifold, and the fuel pressure regulator opens more to allow the fuel 
pressure to drop.

If I remember correctly, when testing the fuel pressure, it's higher 
with the hose disconnected (no vacuum on the port), which is essentially 
the same as running at full throttle (low manifold vacuum).
