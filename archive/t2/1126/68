Subject: Re: [T2] Paint prep

Oh, I'm in a galaxy far, far away! Thanks for the suggestion though.

I did buy a Harbor Freight $99 compressor without knowing anything
about their limitations. I found it was too weak to run the air tools
I bought with it. A friend suggested a secondary tank, so I got a big
Craftsman tank, but haven't done anything with it yet. I did buy a
spray gun too, but it would be my first effort with it, so I'm a bit
shy over it. I suppose that primer on an interior that will largely be
covered up is a low risk for my first effort at running an air gun by
myself, though.

My main worry about using spray cans was that it is not a hardening
paint, so I was afraid using that as an intermediate layer would be a
weak point in the adhesion between the top coat and the body, causing
a potential for future peeling or a weakness to scratches and chips.
So my thought was that if my interior is already compromised with a
layer of rattle can paint, then spray can primer might be just as well
as what's on there already - except that whats on there has many years
of hardening. It just doesn't resist paint thinner.

I'm still debating whether to try to remove more of the old, hardened
cement residue. A heavy wire wheel on an angle grinder won't touch it.
I'm reluctant to go after it with a sanding disk because I don't want
to go down to bare metal and deal with the issues that opens up -
which is the other reason I was wondering if it is okay to use spray
can primer - because some areas that I want to sand down a little
first will need to have a temporary primer protection to keep rust
away while I work on things.
