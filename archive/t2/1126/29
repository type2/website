Well thankyou for all the excellent suggestions folks, much appreciated, and 
after "cooling off" I will attack it again tomorrow. I actually was using 
Vice Grip brand grips that are fairly new, but hey, at 56 I'm gettin' kinda 
whimpy on the clamping power. So far, grinding the head off sounds like the 
winner. I have no shortage of dremels, angle grinders, and various tools of 
mass destruction. Also my apologies for not mentioning it's a loaf, but as 
we all know, when the anger goes up, the reasoning power goes down. :-)
Regards,
Courtney
