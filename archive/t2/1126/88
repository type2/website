Thanks for the responses and pictures.

Talk of a different head is reminding me the intake manifold is only 3
bolts instead of 4.

I'd be curious on the cam specs.

Actually, I'm remembering that in all the different variants of Type 4
engines VW put in the buses over 8 years that there were wide
variations in compression, horsepower, and cams also.

I wish we had a chart showing the specs for each and every change. The
charts at Tunacan are a bit scanty.
