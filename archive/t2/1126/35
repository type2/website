Right. That's the same thing I was talking about. The mark you are
talking about has absolutely no function for the running of the
engine. It's just sort of an advisory to give you can idea where you
should be pointing. The relevant issue is that by changing the dizzy
position to point at a different location for # 1 means that you are
now pointing the rotor at a different plug wire tower which will now
be the new tower for cylinder #1, and hence you have to move the spark
plug wires accordingly.

 the rotor point for # 1 at the same position rotor was to fire #1, but at a

 indicate it is #1.
