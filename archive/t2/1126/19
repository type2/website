An update:

1. I found that the fuel pressure regulator was not connected to a
vacuum line and fixed that.
2. Attempted to change the fuel filter and had the fuel line crack and
crumble! Drained the fuel in a plastic container, removed old fuel
filter. It was full of mud and rust. There's quite a bit of "sediment"
at the bottom of the plastic container.

My fuel lines are 10 years old. How embarrassing!

On my way to buy new fuel line. Things have changed over the last 10
years: I cannot find an auto parts place that carries the proper 7.5
mm line. Even VW tells me they can't reference pre-1998 cars.
Pathetic! Am trying a Mercedes repair shop, but failing that, I'll
have to go with 5/16 (=7.9mm) for the time being (and 3/8 (=9.52mm)
instead of the 10mm between pump and filter).
