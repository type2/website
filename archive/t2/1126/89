I looked into that once and if I recall the 914 cam is very similar to 
the Webcam 107i.  You can find the specs for that on the internet.

I drove a bus equipped with a true Porsche 2-liter engine with the stock 
Porsche cam, larger valve heads etc. and let me tell you it was one heck 
of a ride.  I took it up to about 90 and it still had plenty left to 
give (this was Mike Gensler's bus which also had the Porsche 901 
transaxle).  If I were building another aircooled bus motor, it would 
get the 107i for sure.
