You don't need a dwell meter-but a degree pulley wheel helps- use  just 
a test light on allgator clips or a VOM across the points- remember the 
adage by Muir- timing is when the match is lit, dwell is how long it is 
lit!  I think he gives a spiel how to mark this on your pulley wheel or 
fan housing.
