Get yourself some Picklex for the bare metal. Won't rust outdoors for over a 
year.
I've used it on my bus and many other parts. Great success.

I also didn't want to go down to metal because I don't think a repaint
is as good a protection as the original factory paint. Also, I know
the metal is going to start to rust before I get it painted.

This is getting me really stressed. The indecision has gotten the part
that I already wire wheeled the rust off of starting to rust again as
I have suspended work for a few weeks while I try to figure this out!

Well, 'nuff said for now!
