I bought a set of bolt removers from Advanced Auto. They are Metric. You
just tap the correct size over the bolt put a 3/8 ratchet on it, and with a
bit of a pull, the hex bolt should "pop." after it's loose you should be
fine. I had the same problem with the same issue.

Another suggestion...I have used a torx socket to remove rounded out allen
bolts in the past. Gently hammer the appropriately sized torx (I think the
correct size is M8) 1/2" drive socket into the rounded out hole in the allen
bolt and I always get enough bite to turn it out. I had to do this with some
pulley bolts on an old VW Golf (I think you call it the VW Rabbit over
there) and it worked very nicely.
