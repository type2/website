Subject: Well so far it's beat me. >:-(

Alright, I've gotten every CV joint allen head out except for one on the stub
end. The AH PO obviously was a wanker, as there is NO way this thing wants to
come out. He must have had the Incredible Hulk torque it up for him. Did I
mention that it already looked like he re-used a bolt that was somewhat ovaled
instead of 6 sided!!Things I've tried so far after WD-40 over the last few
days, and tapping it with a hammer:

1) Quality Crafstman allen head socket and ratchet. No way, just spun out.
2) Vice Grips on outside - just spun around the bolt even though I reefed them
on there as hard as I could, and checked I had clearance to spin the grips. No
way.
3) Took a cold chisel and ridged the outside circumference to get the vice
grips to bite better instead of spinning. No way, still spun. :-(
4) Threw a temper tantrum and spoke in tongues I learned in the Army. Wife not
impressed. Me either.

So what's number 5?? Get out my mig, and weld an allen wrench piece into the
hole and use it as an "extension" Little worried about the grease, oil, gas,
electronics about this one.
Thanks,
Courtney (Eyeing some Bud Limes right about now so I don't start speaking in
tongues again)
