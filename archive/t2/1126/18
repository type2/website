So I shouldn't feel so bad about only having a 74 1700.

Exact specs for the various Type 4 engine editions are hard to come
by, but I think I've seen suggestions that some 1700s had higher
compression ratios and more power as well. Wish I could pin that down.
My code CA engine is listed as virtually unknown at Tunacan.net
