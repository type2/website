I have an "impact driver" and adapter to use a 3/8 socket on it.  load it 
up with a torx or other correctly sized tip and let it do it's magic and I 
do mean magic because it has not yet failed to remove the recalitrant 
fastening.

is designed for driving screws in construction but has been a go to tool 
in more places than I ever imagined.
