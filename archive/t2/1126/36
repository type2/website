Wouldn't it cause excessive gas usage at all times *except* for 
wide-open throttle?

I am not an expert on bus fuel injection systems but every other 
vacuum-controlled fuel pressure regulated system I have seen provided 
progressively higher fuel pressure as vacuum decreases.

I also wouldn't expect it to be enough extra fuel to cause backfiring 
though it might be enough to cause a drop in MPG.
