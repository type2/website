Subject: First I've seen- reason for slow gas line leak!

Family mentioned smell of gas around the 78 camper for a few days-it has 
been sitting for overt a month as it's been too &&&#$^ hot for weeks. - 
Did not see anything underneath and thought it was due to a container 
whose bottom had rotten out in the garage.  Drove it yesterday to get 
lumber and fill it up -and then realized I had just over 10 mi to the 
gallon!  Looked more closely at home and indeed, gas was weeping over 
the tranny and evaporating.  Wiped the hose and saw it started 5" from 
the tank outlet, so decided to clamp it, cut it, and splice in a hose 
from filter to the cut via piece of metal gas line tubing I always keep 
on hand.  I left the hose long enough so when I am nearly out of gas, I 
can then run it directly to the tank.
    Looking at the leak, 3 areas had been chewed via some rodent right 
down to the internal braiding and just enough more to weep! 
AAAARRRGGGGHHHH- can't they find some wood to hone their teeth on!
