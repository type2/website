Got a call from the engine builder, the cam was worn down to a lift of
3.5mm from a 7-8mm spec (carburated 2.0liter engine). This means total
lift was reduced by 50% resulting in extremely reduced valve timings
(late opening, low lift, early closure). The cam and followers were
supposed to be *new* according to the former re-builder (a company I
don't trust anymore) that I bought the engine from 5 years ago. Also,
the case has not been align bored in contrast to what is listed on my
bill... Anyway, I'll get two quotes from the engine builder, one for a
mostly stock rebuild, and a second one with a bit more power (better
cam, followers, slightly higher compression, Porsche 914 pistons and
balanced rods, crank, flywheel, pressure plate and fan). I'd love to
get the second one, but I've got to talk to the CEO (fiancie) first.
Cheers,
Timo
