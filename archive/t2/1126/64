Hi everybody,
It's a non-stop party! Last night I adjusted dwell to 50 degrees and
reset the timing. Did not swap the ECU as the part numbers did not
coincide: the number on the spare one ends with an extra "H", so might
be for a later iteration, perhaps one with the 7-prong airflow sensor
(with the built-in air temp sensor).

Left this morning at 6:30 and drove less than 5 miles before the
engine did the lurching thing; made it to a gas station, filled up.
Again checked the obvious, including vacuum hose to brake booster.
Engine starts fine, we drive off and it stalls 50 meters/yards later.
I also checked the fuel pump using Mike's advice. It purrs just fine.

Time to pull the joker card: Premier AAA card for a 200 mile flatbed
tow to Flagstaff. We are now under time pressure. My copilot needs to
catch a plane from Las Vegas Friday morning and my family is anxious
to see me in SoCal.

Some personal info: No, I'm not selling "Le Bus" in California :) I
got a new job in Paris and shipped my convertible bug to France. The
bus was the last item left in Mississippi and I plan to park it in
front of my brother's house in Topanga, CA. It will be our pied `
terre whenever we visit our extended family on the US West coast. The
decision to schlepp it to CA came rather suddenly, which is why I
simply did not have the luxury of preventive maintenance.

Let's hope that the VW dealer in Flagstaff can help. If anybody can
recommend a better repair shop in Flagstaff, please let me know.

Best,
Sami
