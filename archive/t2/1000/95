Cars don't rust much in deserty parts of the US like Arizona, yet dealers
sell just about as many new cars there as anywhere else.

There are very good physical reasons why a device hooked up to the battery
cannot produce a net negative charge on a vehicle's body, unless the
device also produces a net positive charge somewhere else.  A Van de Graff
generator produces a big negative charge on its upper sphere, but it also
produces a big positive charge on its base, where the electrons are
continuously replenished from whatever teh generator is sitting upon.
I don't see any way that the car gadget can do this.
