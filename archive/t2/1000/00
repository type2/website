Subject: AridZona Tech day for Jerome

A special thanks to Chris Hardy for the use of his shop, Arizona Auto Car at
5235 S. Kyrene Road in Tempe.  Aridzona. The tech day before Jerome was
great fun, A/C in aircooled motors being taken out and put in.  Lots of
brake work, VWonderful food from David Lehan. A special thanks to Mark Berke
for the Lube job on my Herbey.  Not a bus, but the Herbmeister wanted to go
for a ride. Herbey must have known something, for when Mark checked the
tranny it was bone dry.?  Any ideas how that could happen with no puddles
under the car.? A lot of smiles and talking VWs. I had to leave by 1:30PM as
the heat again got to this old man. Many thanks Chris, Bless you all, uj
