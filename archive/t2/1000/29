Subject: Hill Climbing Temp

I have seen the information on here about speed versustemperature but I have a question about something a bit less straight ahead.

When I am climbing up the highway on my way over Mt. Hood I can go 45 in 4th gear or 3rd gear, in one its wound up pretty good, in the other it is lugging, in which case am I running cooler?

Thanks,

James in Portland, Oregon
