Volks:

Went through the buses yesterday, got everything ready to go for a September
14th Friday afternoon getaway to Bus BOO at Grand Rogue Campground. Just
have to lay in brew, cigars and chili makin's for the famous chili cook-off
Saturday night.  Looking forward to seeing all our great bus buddies again!

Wish it was tomorrow!

Who's going?
