Travis-
You can extend your allen wrench with a 6mm deep socket
and a socket extension. You can also use an allen socket.
You may need some heat ( the "hot wrench") and all the
disclaimers apply here. The most difficult fasteners
will break loose easily if you apply some heat and then
paraffin (an old candle). Best trick I know.
You may want to do some minor  engine tin disassembly
to have access to the nut and not burn the tin.
Then be sure to anti-sieze it for the next time..
