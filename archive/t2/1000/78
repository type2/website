Good morning, Lehan, Dave (lehandc(-at-)wellsfargo.com)

Does anyone happen to know where I can find the CORRECT wiring diagram for
the 69 single cab? The one on thesamba is pretty accurate I guess except for
the relay controlling the turn signals and emergency flashers (which happnes
to be the bits I'm trying to get to work right now.)
