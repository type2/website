Subject: Re: enrichment via cold start valve switch

Hmmm, guess one could use an extra CSV to inject nearly anything into 
the mix, like water or ether?

Can't you put in an inline resistor to fool the ECU into thinking it's 
colder and thus enrich the mix in a controlled fashion??  I envision an 
inline digital ohmeter where you could dial this on a variable resistor 
(potentiometer).

  - like 90mph on up!
