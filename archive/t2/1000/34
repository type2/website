Subject: cold start problems

My 78 FI Bus will not start without using a starting fluid(ether).   Last 
year I replaced the thermo time switch.    I want to check its condition in case 
it has gone bad.   I have   a resistance of 35 ohms cold (ice cold ) and 70 
ohms warm (over 35 C).   It seems it should have no resistance when cold and 
infinite when hot, if I understand how it is made and works.   Is a valid way to 
test it to jump the terminals of the connector to it so that ground is sent to 
the cold start valve all the time the starter is cranking the engine.   It 
might be a bit rich when warm but I would think opening the throttle should be 
able to cope with additional fuel.    What do people think of trying this.   It 
might at the worst confirm a bad thermo time switch or tell me I should look 
else where, such as spark (have not tested, but as it runs after starting I 
think this is probably not the problem.   Thanks for any and all advice
