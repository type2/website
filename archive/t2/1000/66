where does the power come from is this wired into the battery, and if
not how is it powered when the car is off, and how does it keep from
draining the battery if it is on all the time??

get a couple pieces of steel, face south at 45 degree angle. slice the
steel so each piece is identical and hook one up and leave one plain.
I also might consider just putting some paint on one and maybe por 15
on another...

use several of each.  one winter would be a nice start, but probably
need longer for good results, take photo regularly of each (first
Sunday of each month, or on the 1st of each month some rememberable
date)

and be sure to keep us updated on the results, maybe even consider
using some old VW panels... ones beyond reuse please
