FWIW an old guy dad used to work with (at AT&T) in the 70's used to bolt bits of Mg sacrificial annode (that AT&T used to attach to their underground cables for exactly the same purpose) to the frame and body of his vehicles.  He was still driving a '50s Chevy pickup in the late 70's long after it would have normally succumbed in salt laden WV.  We had several of the annodes laying around the house and I always meant to try, never had.  This is a purely passive thing but I don't know those active systems JC Whitless and the others have pawned for years don't work.  VW did this themselves to some extent with the little zinc annode plates bolted between the front fenders and unibody of their FWD cars, I assume they still do.  How bad they would rust without them is an unknown to me, I have seen replacement fenders rust worse than factory when a body shop ommitted them but probably also off shore sheet metal so who knows.  So maybe/maybe not entire snake oil.  All corrosion is
 electro/galvanic/whatever in nature.  You can have a scarificial annode for your waterboxer heads now days, and all hot water heaters have them, will they help on a car body???
