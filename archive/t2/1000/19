Check the yellow pages.  Probably any mobile service
will be able to get a late bay windshield.  They
should be able to provide the seal too, but if you
want to be certain you get a higher-quality seal (as
opposed to a mexi-knockoff) you will need to order it
online.  Try busdepot.com or any of the other VW
specialty shops.
