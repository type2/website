Subject: Re: [T2] Hill Climbing Temp

> When I am climbing up the highway on my way over Mt. Hood I can go 45 in 4th gear or 3rd gear, in one its wound up pretty good, in the other it is lugging, in which case am I running cooler?

Right off the bat, I would automatically say 3rd.

HOWEVER

It depends on... Incline, throttle position, year, transmission,
engine, mods, etcetcetcetc.

For example, in my 78, 4th at 1/2 throttle doing 45 wouldn't bother
me. My 73 would have melted down under the same conditions.
