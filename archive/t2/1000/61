Subject: Oil Bath Air Filter hose

Hi all,

'71 1600dp

Quick question about the hose that connects to the bottom of the oil
bath air filter. During my engine swap on KK last weekend I lost the
metal tube that connects to the oil bath hose. Is that part necessary
or can I drive without it until a new one arrives. I have the hose
pointed at my engine bay door for right now.

Thank you,

Max
