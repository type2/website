I have seen replacement fenders rust worse than factory when a body shop
ommitted them but probably also off shore sheet metal so who knows.  So
maybe/maybe not entire snake oil.  All corrosion is

annode for your waterboxer heads now days, and all hot water heaters have
them, will they help on a car body???

Only if the car body is immersed in a somewhat conducitive electrolyte
like water with a few impurities in it.

The sacrificial anode work by creating a weak sort of battery and then
sacrificing itself before the metal it is attached to starts to sacrifice
itself.  Without the electolyte it doesn't work.
