There is a company out of England that makes a very close to original
curtains for early bay windows. I ordered a material sample and it is as
close as you are ever going to find. Not perfect, but close. Check them out

Check out the Olive and Butter Patchwork fabric:

There are a variety of online vendors for bus parts. 
These should all have curtains in case you need to go
with new (repros).

Not really.......

The 73 curtains are a plaid cotton.

The only 'new' replacements are here:
http://www.plfvw.com/campers/curtains/curtains.asp
but be warned..... they are NOT cheap!

Unit Price: Full Set $700.00
      Specify year 1965-19671968-1973
      68-73 Select Front Curtain

100% Cotton Curtains. After looking for almost 10 years we have found these
perfect reproduction curtains and
bought all the fabric available. These are pretty much dead on perfect
replacement down to the weave of the
thread and perfect colors. These were reproduced in Germany and now are
available here while supplies last,
and they are already half gone. If you must have the correct originals for
your bus these are it. Stock in
most of the Westfalia SO-42 and Campmobiles 70s. I recommend treating these
with a UV resistant spray
available below.
