Subject: Heater control box to accordion tube cuffs

While replacing the heater control boxes on my wife's 73 Westy I've  
found that the metal and asbestos cuffs which go between the control  
box and the accordion tube have disintegrated.

I'm having trouble sourcing the cuffs.  After reading item #5 on  
http://www.ratwell.com/technical/Heating.html I'd prefer the silicone  
Vanagon ones (251-255-393D) over asbestos, but at this point I may  
just take what I can get.  Other than finding donor bays/Vanagons,  
does anyone have a source?

Thanks
-Matt
