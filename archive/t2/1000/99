All vehicles in WV come with the electrolyte George, NaCl in water, all winter long.  Another bit along the same line, this happens with VW's and notoriously with Japanese "imports" with all the cad plated stuff, hardware, door pins, fuel/AC lines, etc.  The white powdery crusting, then the rust as the plating sacrifices.  I've often thought the manufacturers would be better served not plating the stuff at all or using better stuff.  For instance the locks and door pins on my Audi 200s were still plated in something shinier and silver (nickel, even chrome maybe?) even though they were exact VW parts bin parts and looked great when an equivalent year VW part was rusting.
