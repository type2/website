If this worked every car manufactuerer would be installing it.

The idea is suspicious on its face.  The claim is that the system provides
free electrons on the outer surface of the car.  Physics types call that
"having a negative charge".  One of the laws of physics is the
conservation of charge.  Those "free electons" have to come from somewhere
and that place has to be outside the car.  I don't think tht anything
internal to the car could charge the outer surface of the car.

I'd love to get close to this demo car with an electrometer and actually
measure the surface charge.
