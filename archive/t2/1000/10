Subject: FYI: Interior Panel Plastic Clip Source

Thought I'd share...

After having some difficulty locating the black
plastic interior panel clips for the sliding door and
rear hatch panel, I found these things at a FLAPS, and
was able to order them in quantity from
Partsamerica.com

They fit perfectly, but are not identical to the OEM
in that they have a center post which you push in to
fasten them...the center post sticks out a little once
fastened.  But the good news is thet they can be
unfastened repeatedly by fulling the center post out
(the OEM ones usually break when removed).


Part:  RIVET-TITE 47920
Source: FLAPS (small Qty) or partsamerica.com for
larger qty.
