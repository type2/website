Dan asked:


 I have an under-bus gas heater that sort of works.
 
 (1) How can I tell what model it is?

~ under the bus is a BA-6
 
 (2) If it cuts out and has to have the circuit
 breaker reset after 5 minutes of operation, does
 it matter which heater it is or is the answer the
 same and obvious?  (not obvious to me, yet)

~ have you perused this site?
