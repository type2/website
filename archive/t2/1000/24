The process is called Cathodic Protection.

you can read all about the process here :
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathodic_protection

Theres some additional literature here :
http://www.corrosion-doctors.org/CP/Introduction.htm

The above page also specifically addresses the very question you ask.

Based on my knowledge which was gleaned from a few different places on
the web, I think these systems might work, but not anything like the
claims from the manufacturers.

I think it depends alot on the ambient moisture in the air in the case
of a car which is electrically separated from the ground.  So if you
live somewhere dry, it may not be as effective, of course if you live
somewhere dry, rust isn't going to be your primary concern anyways.
