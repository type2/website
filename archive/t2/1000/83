Subject: spare tire nose mount stock?

To settle an argument, what years (if any) did the bus come with a
spare tire mounted on the front from the factory?

A guy I met today had a '74 Westy and insisted it came with it on the
front stock. I didn't think it did because it had that worthless
inflatable tire under the sink....same for '75.

I wasn't sure about '76-'79, but I am pretty sure that they didn't
come stock with a tire on the front.

please settle this :)
