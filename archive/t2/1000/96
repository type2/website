Hi George,

I can think of two reasons why new cars still sell well in arid reasons:

1. New cars are a status symbol. Some people just get addicted to  
that smell.

2. Used cars from arid regions migrate to the rust belt, to help  
offset our demand for new vehicles. I know of quite a few people who  
make it a habit to buy southern or western vehicles regularly.

I dunno how they maintain that charge, either; but if these things  
have been used in industrial applications as advertised then you  
would think that they have proven their usefulness.


Happy Trails,
