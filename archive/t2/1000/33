Subject: RE: [T2] new windshield for 73 bus in CAlifornia?

I had a PPG dark tint  windshield installed in my driveway for $125.00,
tax, title, license, & destination fee.

It was a done deal, and pretty reasonable.

Not expensive at all.

Let your finger's do the walking, it's a real competitive business.
