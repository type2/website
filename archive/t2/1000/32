Subject: Re: [T2] Buses by the Beach Bus BOO!

Wow, I get to see this on two lists now - and it made me even more excited
the second time.

We wouldn't miss this for the world. Our second Bus Boo and third Buses by
the Beach event.

I took Tursday off work to get everything ready although mos everything is
set to go. I can't wait to see old friends and meet new ones.

If you've never been to one of these I strongly suggest you come - bring the
whole family and have a great weekend with some wonderful people.

So who will be going?

I can't wait!!!!!!!!!!!!! Pete - I'll see you on Friday :)
