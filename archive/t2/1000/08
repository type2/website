 There are a variety of online vendors for bus parts.
 These should all have curtains in case you need to go
 with new (repros).

Not really.......

The 73 curtains are a plaid cotton.

The only 'new' replacements are here: http://www.plfvw.com/campers/curtains/curtains.asp
but be warned..... they are NOT cheap!

Unit Price: Full Set $700.00
      Specify year 1965-19671968-1973
      68-73 Select Front Curtain

100% Cotton Curtains. After looking for almost 10 years we have found these perfect reproduction curtains and
bought all the fabric available. These are pretty much dead on perfect replacement down to the weave of the
thread and perfect colors. These were reproduced in Germany and now are available here while supplies last,
and they are already half gone. If you must have the correct originals for your bus these are it. Stock in
most of the Westfalia SO-42 and Campmobiles 70s. I recommend treating these with a UV resistant spray
available below.
