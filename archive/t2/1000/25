Subject: Re: [T2] OEM wheels?

Hey, Rick, where are you located? I have five stock wheels from my '79 that
I'm planning on removing. They have the correct tires, but they are worn.
They are all in great shape professionally painted white. I'm in Alameda (SF
Bay area). Let me know if you might be interested and I'll get moving on
their replacements.
