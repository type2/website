Subject: Re: [T2] Brake booster shot?

I doubt it's the brake vacuum hose, otherwise the
problem would be apparent at all times.

Sounds much more like the diaghram in the brake
booster...vacuum is applied to this diaghram when you
push the brake pedal, and the force of the vacuum
helps make the pedal easier to push.  Since the
diaghram is just a rubber sheet, it will dry out and
crack eventually.

It is normal to notice a slight, but only momentary,
change in engine idle speed when you apply the brake
pedal...this is due to small amount of air moving in
the booster when the pedal moves.  But a continous
hissing and/or engine speed change indicates that the
diagrahm is leaking. This leak results in air flowing
through the cracked diaghram into the vacuum hose, and
then to the engine. The FI (or carbs) is not expecting
this air, so it runs poorly.

Since vacuum is applied to the diaghram only when you
press the pedal, that is when the problem occurs. 

I had this happen several year ago...I disconnected
the booster hose from the engine (and plugged both
holes) until I had time to get and install a rebuilt
booster.  The brake will be harder to apply, but is
not a problem for a strong person.   

The rebuilt boosters are available from busdepot and
install with normal tools.

After I started my van, I started pumping the brake
and noticed that when I
pumped the brake, the engine struggled. However, when
I took my foot off the
brake, it idled fine. Also, I noticed that there was a
heavy breathing noise
I heard whenever I hit the brake that was coming from
the area of my front
wheel. I looked around there, but could not see any
obvious leaks.
