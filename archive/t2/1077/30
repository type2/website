Never tried it, but it sounds plausible.  I have seen the wiring
diagrams for some American cars where they run a resistor in parallel
with the alternator warning lamp, possibly so the alternator will
still charge even if the lamp burns out.

The instrument lamps on 12-volt VWs are either 1.2 W or 2 W.  At 12 V
nominal, this gives a current (at full brightness) of 0.10 or 0.17 A,
or a resistance (at full brightness) of 120 or 72 ohms.  Since the
alternator has to draw less than this if it doesn't want to light up
the lamp, starting somewhere around a couple of hundred ohms might be
about right.

Trying some standard resistor values, and assuming 15 V system voltage
and that the alternator has zero resistance, we have:

220 ohms  allows 0.068 A  dissipates 1.02 W  (use a 2 W resistor)
330 ohms  allows 0.045 A  dissipates 0.68 W  (use a 1 W or 2 W resistor)
470 ohms  allows 0.032 A  dissipates 0.48 W  (use a 1 W resistor)

In the real world, the system voltage won't be as high, and the internal
resistance of the alternator won't be zero, so you won't get as much
current (or need to dissipate as much power) as these.

Rat Shock doesn't have much in the way of power resistors, but they do
stock 1 W resistors in 10, 100, and 1000 ohms.  If you bought the 100-ohm
ones and use at least two in series, they probably won't burn up.
