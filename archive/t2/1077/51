Subject: Re: [T2] Anyone know the advance curve for the 74-75 Beetle 

Here's a comparison of curves from my website:

0231170034 (Bosch German):
http://www.oldvolkshome.com/ignition.htm#A1974MFD

0231170034 (Bosch Mexico):
http://www.oldvolkshome.com/ignition.htm#A905205ZB

Richard Atwell's Advance Chart:
http://www.ratwell.com/technical/FAQ/images/DizzyCurvesVac.gif

0231170093 (Late 76-79 Bus, Fed 80-83 Vanagon)
http://www.oldvolkshome.com/ignition.htm#B7679

I've never seen any spec chart that says the Type 4 FI engine needs a total
of 40 degrees advance - HOWEVER - that spec may be for the Porsch 914 2.0
version of that engine.  Buses required a bit less. Look at my links above.

I know from personal experience that the 034 distributor will work in place
of the original 093 just fine with the exception that the rotor will be off
by 180 degrees at #1 TDC.  I've also run a 093 distributor on a single port
1600 upright for a few years with no ill effects.  The vacuum and mechanical
curves are close enough for either distributor to work in either
application.  Both are timed at 7.5 degrees BTDC with the advance hose
disconnected and plugged.

Running a 034 on a Late 76-on Type 4 FI Bus is a considerable savings,
considering a BRAND NEW 093 distributor (still available) is going for a
"cool" $775 (give or take) from Bosch these days IF you can find it.
