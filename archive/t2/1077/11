Did you change the fat wire that runs from the battery to the starter?  
That can make a big difference.

The problem is old connections not allowing enough current to flow 
through the ignition switch and then back to the starter solenoid.

If I remember correctly, when wires heat up, they have more resistance.  
If you haven't changed the big wire that goes to the starter, that might 
be your problem right there, as it is definitely heating up.  Changing 
that wire out made a huge difference for me.  It also made everything 
run brighter, too...
