Jon is partially right. VW never installed any of the horrible bolt  
on spare tire mounts. However, Westfalia offered a fron bumper mod  
that place the tire partially behind the front bumper. See: http://

I just cut this section out from my old body and can take  
measurements of the cross member mods as soon as my container arrives  
in Germany.
