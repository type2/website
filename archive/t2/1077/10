I should add that the battery is new, as are the cables along with the
grounding strap from the tranny. This seemed to clear up the "hot" starting
problem when the engine was warm. I feel this problem is with the ignition
switch as it rears it's head when the cabin is warm. Seems I remember Richard
Atwell talking about a plastic tab on the later ignition switches but I can't
find it anywhere and I sure don't look forward to changing the switch if
that's not the problem.

Actually, it doesn't.  I had a new battery with a cold-start relay and it
still didn't start...

If you really want to fix the problem, find the issue that's actually causing
the problem.  Usually this is corroded terminals, old wires, etc.  I would
first start by looking at your battery terminals - are they nice and clean? 
How do the battery clamps look - are they nice and clean?  If not, replace
them!  That alone can make a world of difference.

If you really want to improve your starts, replace the main wire that runs
from the battery to the starter as it's nice and old and probably pretty
corroded under the battery clamp.  An easy one to change is the ground wire
that runs from the battery to the chassis.  Clean up all of your connections
at the starter (disconnect the ground wire first!) and put on new main battery
terminals.  Be sure to clean the ground strap that runs from the transmission
to the chassis as well.  I did all of that on my bus and it was amazing how
fast it cranked over... *every* time!
