the blinkers are a problem, I just taped mine up real good, but if you
want to remove them you need to drill out the rivets then rerivet when

headlights are easier, there is  a screw on the side of the trim ring
that removes the ring and under there are some screws that allow you
to remove most of the stuff in there
