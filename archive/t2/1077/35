Why to leave it?, because it is a stinking dead waste of space inside.  Yes,
sure as hell, it is not uncommon to have the spare hit something that the
bumper may have first (or more likely at the same time), conversely if you hit
something hard enough to damage it much, might have damaged the
nose regardless, who knows.  They are about even at least on mine, bumper and
spare, so unless you hit something perpendicular flat on or on a downhill
angle (a wall, a van, etc) if you were hitting that high up with the spare,
you were still likely hitting it without the spare.  Plus you take it off, you
got to fill 3-4 holes, do paintwork, etc.  I like the spare on the nose, yep
I've seen tons of em hit, but I like the interior space given for storage on
my '77 more than I'm concerned about it getting dented.  This is of course one
where YYMV massively.  I mean if you are doing a full body/repaint maybe I'd
take it off, otherwise you are losing space
 and having an ugly bracket there or holes to fix.  Alternative like hefting
even a regular spare up onto the roof is a pain.  I've even had opportunity to
use 2 spares this way, one inside and one out when running on a real bad
stretch of road, and it allows you to mount an oversize spare for oversize
tires, where anything much bigger is a tight fit in the stock '77-'79
cabinet.

persist in mounting spare on front of bus.  They said having it there negates
the purpose of front bumper, because spare would 'impact' first, and push
nose
in before bumper had chance!  Now I am tempted to take entire front mount off
