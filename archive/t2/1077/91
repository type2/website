Are those mahle pistons and cylinders?  94mm, correct?  Did you get 
everything balanced?  Btw, where are you located?  I'm in Long Beach...

Looks like they've been cut - I'd definitely CC the heads unless the 
rebuilder told you the head chamber volume!  If you just assume it's the 
same as stock, you could end up with a CR that's higher than stock!  
Also, make sure that when you put the barrel into the head, does the top 
of the barrel seat nicely on the head, or do the fins hit?  There should 
be a gap between the top fin of the barrel and the head.


Here is how you check your deck height:

I would recommend just using a steel bar bolted across the cylinder 
instead of a plate as it gives you more places to stick the feeler gauge 
under and average out the measurements.  Make sure that your steel bar 
is thick enough (1/2in) and smooth.  DO NOT just bolt the cylinders down 
on the fins - they'll break!  When you initially check your deck height, 
do it without any spacers underneath the cylinders.  You can put shims 
underneath if you really want to, but it'll change your measurements and 
you might have to pull the cylinders off again to change the barrel 
spacing with different shims.

Instead of using the syringe, I'd use a burette instead as it will yield 
*much* more reliable measurements.  I bought this one and it worked great:

When you drill your hole in the plexiglass, put the hole off to the side 
of the chamber - makes it easier to get the bubble out.

The site recommends using water, but I would highly recommend using 
rubbing alcohol with a few drops of food coloring - cleanup is MUCH 
easier and you don't have to worry about the water promoting corrosion 
on your head parts.  Also, don't forget to put the spark plug in the 
hole... .. . . yeah.... kinda makes a mess... don't ask me how I know ;)


Here's some more neat stuff as well:

A few other things - I prefer to have my pistons, rods, crank, (pretty 
much everything that turns or moves) all balanced.  It will make your 
engine run super smooth! 

Once you have all your measurement numbers, post 'em to the list and 
then we can calculate your required deck height.  This is the site I 
used, but it might take a bit of help to know what to put where:
