My guess is something's in the fuel tank cup and rolling over the intake 
inlet and starving the bus for fuel.

This one's a major PITA to diagnose without taking the tank out and 
examining the inside to make sure it's clean.  What you might do is hook 
up a pressure gauge to the fuel pressure port and have a passenger in 
the back watch the gauge to see if it drops during the turn.  That 
should give you an idea of the problem.  If the pressure drops, then I'd 
guess it's in the tank, as there really isn't much else in the fuel 
system that's related to the banking of the car.

You might also try hooking up a voltmeter to the fuel pump and run it up 
to the front to find out if the fuel pump is shutting off during the 
hard turn.
