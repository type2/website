Subject: fuel pump mount

My rubber fuel pump mount has let go from the frame.

I have not taken it off yet, but will with the rest of the fuel system work.

How do people work for extended periods of time under vans, block them up? Jack Stands?

Blocking seems safer, I guess 1 foot by 8 foot cut up into 2 foot chunks?
