Subject: SVDA installed

So to follow up on an old thread..( was Timing)
got me a svda 205 got rid of the 009 ( actually is spare under the seat now)
found out that my timing gear is in correct, the 009 is 90 degrees off,
(thanks to all the responses on that )
bus runs way better with the +40 degrees advance i get with the correct
dizzy, also gained 3-4 mpg went from roughly 15-16 mpg to 19.5 WHOO-HOO!
weird little thing though, the condensor ground wire goes to the neg on the
coil, i had it on the pos by accident, so the #9 fuse blew out a few times
til i figured out the wire need to be on the neg, well lastnight i had the
interior light on in the bus and the #9 fuse melted,
( when this fuse pops there is nothing, no lights  no nada) but it didnt
pop, it just melted...hmmm gotta find that bug now.

Also , i am experiencing what seems to be a stutter in the engine, like if
there were an off switch and someone just flicked it real quick , so the
whole engine just goes off then back on again , i can feel it..i think its
fuel related somehow, crap in the tank?, dirty fuel filter?
likee if there were an air bubble in the line..maybe the fuel pump just
shuts off for a sec due to bad ground? gotta fix that too.Joe
