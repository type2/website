Subject: won't start

I have new batteries, new cables, new tranny grounding strap. When the engine is COLD, first thing in the morning, BUT the outside temp is 75 or more it will not crank. I feel like it is the switch but would like some imput before I make that drastic of a move. ???? I have run a wire from the starter into the engine compartment and with the key on I can start the engine by connecting to the positive post on the battery.
