Subject: Getting ready to do some welding

Hey Type 2ers-

  This is a more general question, but has a specific application to my 1977
Transporter.  I'm going to need to do some welding on the body to replace a few
small panels, and need to do some welding on the floor to change seat
positions. Unfortunately, I screwed around in metal shop in high school, so
really only know a bit about welding, so I'll need to practice a bit before
doing anything to the bus.  However, it's a skill I'd like to have anyway.

  My question is, there's MIG, TIG, and Arc welding, and I'm not really sure
which kind of welder is best for body work.  I'd like to get a small welder
first (maybe from Home Despot) and see how that works out.  I understand I need
to keep the voltage low no matter what kind of welder I get, since the sheet
metal is so thin and you don't want to warp it.  Which kind of welder should I
get?  Any other welding tips for an amateur welder?

Cheers,
Paul
