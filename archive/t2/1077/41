 There is always going to be pro and con about this issue. I think with the
right tire cover, the tire in the front looks cool, but I'm taking mine off
because there are several dents in the nose from the tire being pushed it.
Filling holes, sanding and painting is good practice for when I do the rest
of the body.

I hit a truck once with the spare mounted on the front, both the bumper AND
the spare tire absorbed the impact, so in a sense it extends the bumper
upwards, spreads the impact forces.

YMMV
