Yeah, it's those annoying Healy filler nozzles!  I hate those things!!  
If you run them at full flow, they leak out the side.

I usually turn it counterclockwise about 90 degrees and that kinda 
helps, but yeah, super annoying.

An adapter would be nice, but I'd worry about the fuel shutting off 
correctly...
