Someone *just* posted up a message a week or so ago mentioning the fuel 
pump mount.  I don't think it was the exact size as the original, but 
they did say that it was a perfect substitution with a little bit of 
trimming - I have no idea who posted it, though...

I changed the topic and hopefully that person will speak up.
