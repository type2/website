Subject: Re: [T2] Insulation inside of tin around exhaust header

Thanks!  I thought it might be asbestos and so I was very careful

In regards to the right side; you are correct.  I wasn't thinking  
straight when I wrote that second question.  On the right side I do  
have a square port heater box; not a header.
