Subject: Update: Engine Miss

I was still having engine miss issues after checking compression, spark
plugs/wires, etc. So, I decided to start to undo things I changed
recently. Put my old distributor cap/rotor back on. I'm now on day 4
with the old cap/rotor and no engine miss. Now I have to decide if it's
worth isolating which component is at fault.  I am curious....
