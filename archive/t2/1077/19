Subject: Shock Nut size needed

<p>This is being forwarded on behalf of a buddy of mine who is not on  
the list. Please cc Adoom*AT*Rogers.com in your  
response.</p><p></p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Greg</p><p></p><p>Hi folks, I  
almost got my front end back together on the weekend,
except the lower shock mount nuts. I can't find a nut that fits. I
can't explain it. I have 2 nuts that look like they should fit...but
don't. <br /><br />I contemplated re-tapping them, but I thought I  
should ask, what is the CORRECT size and pitch for these nuts? <br  
/><br />I want to pick up new hardware tonight, so that I can finish  
the install tomorrow. <br /><br />FWIW, with the new shocks in place,  
the van is definately taller now. Damn.
