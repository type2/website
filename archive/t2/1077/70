Re tank blockage:
Been there last trip to Indiana Dunes; blockage over the fuel inlet will
make the pump cavitate (starve) and you get strange hesitation like you
are running on empty.  Usually the vacuum of the fuel will keep the
blockage there (in my case a $#*&$*&$PO had coated the tank  and it
peeled off in dime to quarter size pieces within the cup and blocked the
inlet. I had to periodically blow up into the gasline to push it out of
the way. In your case it may be something heavy enough to roll away.
See attached to cut the access hole over the tank sender (jigsaw is OK,
it is about  2" down to the tank) and use that to inspect within the
tank, using a light you can drop in there and a mirror on a wire to see.
   Make sure tank is drained! I vacuumed the interior (the vacuum was 30
ft away) with a flexible metal hose used for gas stoves; it will scream
so have good earmuffs handy. In one of my ispiration moments, I thought
of pulling the gas lin to the bend tank inlet and pushing a wire up
there so it would sit above the inlet and nothing can block the inlet again?
Other ideas- it may be a touchy contact arm in the airflow meter or the
wire to the fuel pump itself- make a jumper (alligator clips) from the
pump to the battery plus on the ignition and see if it still hesitates.
