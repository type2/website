Subject: pre-76 throttle body with D-shaft sticking out the bottom

Does anyone have the part number for the throttle body with a D-shaft 
sticking out the bottom of it from a pre-76 bus?  The post 76 bus 
switched over to a throttle switch on top of the throttle body, but the 
pre-76 one had a shaft that stuck out the bottom to connect to a switch 
unit that I believe controlled the electronic EGR on those models...

Thanks!
Mike
