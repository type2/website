Subject: Hitch mounted and looking good!!!

okay, so after the mock-up, I thunk it over a little and decided to make it
happen. What I did and learned was awesome! Radom, This thing is tits!

Since like many of you, my rear most captive nuts were rusted and shot, I
"created" a new mounting point by drilling new holes into the frame almost
in between where the captive nuts are located. It seems as if the captive
nuts located to the rear-most portion are the ones that rust out bad, while
the inner ones that are set up for the stock hitches can hold up sice their
mounted to the frame. This is why I chose to go with the frame.

I mocked up the system again and drilled threw the bumper mounts into the
frame in order to ensure that my holes would be perfectly lined up. Next
took a corresponding size tap and gave the holes in the frame some threads
while widening the holes on the bumper mount in order for there to be a
little room to move should things be a little off.

Next, I mounted the hitch, but did so loosely and marked my holes in the
bumper. I mounted the hitch loosely so that it would push on the bumper when
it was tightened up.

Finally, I put the whole thing together and I was shocked!!! tongue weight
rating for the hitch is 100 lbs. However, when I mounted it to the bumper in
the fashion I did, the whole system was easily able to hold me up without
budging... that 230lbs!

Now I'm not settling on the bumper mount bolts as they are to be the end of
the story. I wanted to add some strength to the system for when I finally
get around to getting the 2 rusted out captive nuts repaired. However, until
that happens, it looks like this baby is gonna hold my little motorcycle
trailer just perfectly!
