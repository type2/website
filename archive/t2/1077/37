Subject: feeler gauges lost, mid-job

71, type2, just adjusting valves, and wham ! GAUGES missing.
I remember reading something years ago about the cover of the John Muir 
Idiots book being .004"

searching web, seems an  aluminum soft drink can is .004  - all the 
refs are on gun sites!

any other suggestions before I cycle to FLAPS?
TIA
