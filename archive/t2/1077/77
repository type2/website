Subject: Fuel pump question

Have Del 40s on an 1.8L motor in my 74 Westy, and after crawling around
underneath it in prep for electric fuel pump and reg, ...thought, maybe I am
'reinventing" the wheel, and maybe the stock mechanical pump might put out
enough fuel pressure to run the 'Dels".  Can the stock fuel pump do this?
Can't find data in my manuals.  Any response appreciated.  Cheers.
