Subject: Getting the lights off the nose

Hey Type 2ers-

  I'm stripping down the body to (as practically as I can) bare metal
currently.  I've got 1977 Transporter and while working on the lights on the
front, I've run into some real head scratchers.  First, the blinkers are
riveted on.  Eventually, I broke the plastic trying to figure out how to get
them off (patience really is a virtue).  However. there's still the wire that's
connected to those blinkers.  It's got a rubber boot over the actual
connection, and I can't for the life of me, figure out how to get that off.
Also, how in the world do the headlights come off?  I don't see any screws or
tabs or anything.

  I don't really want to get going on any other parts of my resto project
until I get the nose all ready.  I seem to have this problem of wanting to work
on everything at the same time, which is resulting in a lot of half finished
things.  :)  Now that I'm a bit more focused though, I seem to notice I get
stuck a lot more often.  Go figure.  If I can just figure out how to get the
lights off in front, I'll be a happy camper.

Cheers,
Paul
