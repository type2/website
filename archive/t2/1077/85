Subject: Re: [T2] Just a question (front tire- Marcus, note?)

I saw camper  VW buses in Germany- on the road and in the Museum, that 
had the spare mounted in a special pod attached to the front bumper (it 
may have been part of the bumper?  Marcus, you there?

  The front mounted spare is ONLY to free up space in the cabin, and was
  offered primarily in the U.S. as a dealer installed item. VW NEVER
  installed a front mounted spare from the factory.
