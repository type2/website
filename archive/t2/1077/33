Subject: Just a question

Was having a "chinwag" with some other VW bus owners, and they asked me why I
persist in mounting spare on front of bus.  They said having it there negates
the purpose of front bumper, because spare would 'impact' first, and push nose
in before bumper had chance!  Now I am tempted to take entire front mount off
of bus, and "squirrel" away the spare inside somewhere.  Mine is a '74, and I
know 'later" Westys stored them inside behind driver.  Thoughts?  Cheers
