Subject: RE: [T2] vw bus question head spacer

numbers are in,
deck height .645mm and cc are 58cc. i plugged it in the super duper calculator
and it tells me i need 2mm spacers.(aprox)
which would run me at anywhere from 7.3:1 ~7.4:1(i am factoring in the unknown
factors.....ie.  measurement differences)
it amounts to the using the 8 spacers (2 per cylinder) supplied in the gasket
kit....which works out awesome.

To answer your questions, i am from Alberta Canada(right next to the Canadian
Rockies)  I am a CF-18 mechanic. I come twice a year to southern California
for our guys to use the ranges down there. Hopefully next we are down in cali,
it would be awesome to come and see one of your club meetings. Another one of
my buddies has a 78 westy and we should be there at the same time, im sure we
would do the 5 hr drive for a weekend thing!!!(oct-nov timframe; and no we are
not allowed to take our westys with us...)

I cant thank you enough, the information provided to me has been exceptional.
Cheers to all, and i will most likely be posting again....because i am a
newbee...lol

Thanks agian
Frank

hi,

sorry, i did forget to tell a bit more my story



1979 bloc, crank has been checked by machinist and is good. Cam has been

replaced, cam gear as well. I put stock 2000cc cyl and pistons from
cip1.ca,

heads are from a rebuilder in California.




Are those mahle pistons and cylinders?  94mm, correct?  Did you get
everything balanced?  Btw, where are you located?  I'm in Long Beach...



here are pics of the heads

Looks like they've been cut - I'd definitely CC the heads unless
the rebuilder told you the head chamber volume!  If you just assume
it's the same as stock, you could end up with a CR that's higher than
stock!  Also, make sure that when you put the barrel into the head,
does the top of the barrel seat nicely on the head, or do the fins
hit?  There should be a gap between the top fin of the barrel and the
head.





Here is how you check your deck height:

I would recommend just using a steel bar bolted across the cylinder
instead of a plate as it gives you more places to stick the feeler
gauge under and average out the measurements.  Make sure that your
steel bar is thick enough (1/2in) and smooth.  DO NOT just bolt the
cylinders down on the fins - they'll break!  When you initially check
your deck height, do it without any spacers underneath the cylinders.
You can put shims underneath if you really want to, but it'll change
your measurements and you might have to pull the cylinders off again to
change the barrel spacing with different shims.

Instead of using the syringe, I'd use a burette instead as it will
yield *much* more reliable measurements.  I bought this one and it
worked great:

When you drill your hole in the plexiglass, put the hole off to the
side of the chamber - makes it easier to get the bubble out.



The site recommends using water, but I would highly recommend using
rubbing alcohol with a few drops of food coloring - cleanup is MUCH
easier and you don't have to worry about the water promoting corrosion
on your head parts.  Also, don't forget to put the spark plug in the
hole... .. . . yeah.... kinda makes a mess... don't ask me how I know ;)





Here's some more neat stuff as well:

A few other things - I prefer to have my pistons, rods, crank, (pretty
much everything that turns or moves) all balanced.  It will make your
engine run super smooth!



Once you have all your measurement numbers, post 'em to the list and
then we can calculate your required deck height.  This is the site I
used, but it might take a bit of help to know what to put where:
