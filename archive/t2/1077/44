Subject: Anyone know the advance curve for the 74-75 Beetle Distribitor?

The VW parts number is 0231170034
BusDepot claims it's the same as the Type 4 (my 78 FI bus) distributor 
with the #1 notch 180 deg opposite- anyone have this who can verify the 
curve, since the later FI engines need over 40 deg advance, while the 71 
(also listed in their application list) I think is 28 deg?
