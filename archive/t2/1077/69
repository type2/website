Hi Folks,

This is a follow-up on a post I made a week ago.  I was having trouble
with the brakes pulling to the left.  I had several good suggestions from
list members, but it turned out more obvious than I'd expected.  I pulled
both wheels.  And I found that the right wheel bearing seal was starting
to throw grease.  It wasn't too bad, and I was able to get it good and
clean.  At the moment the brakes are working much better.  I still need to
flush the brake lines, which I hope to do this weekend.  So my mistake was
in believing that since I'd just had the wheels off and inspected
everything, and because the parts were pretty new, that the problem wasn't
in the wheel.  I should have pulled the wheels first thing, even if they
were just off a few hundred miles ago.

Thanks for the suggestions.

Best,
Jerry
