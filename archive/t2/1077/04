Did you see Little Miss Sunshine?  :)

Check your fuses.  I had a bad connection on my fuses that was causing a
similar issue in my dash.

My 71 bus has developed the following problems. LH signal makes the horn
work.
Now the wipers don't work - they were fine till the signal problem
started.
Now I have headlight problems too.  Headlights work on low but not on
high.

So, what do I do.  Have never had any of these problems before.
