Subject: Re: [T2] fuel pump

There are lots of ways to secure it and mute the vibrations. The CIS  
fuel pump in my wife's cabriolet is encased in a foam rubber insulator  
much like one of those soda/beer can chillers; ("Koozies") then the  
whole assembly is clamped to the frame of the vehicle. I can't see why  
that wouldn't also work for a bus.

This is what I am talking about:

Added bonus: Installed correctly it could also help protect the  
electrical wiring.
