Subject: carb leaking

Greetings,

I am putting my bus back together after a rebuild and after doing the cam run
in I noticed a fuel leak coming out of the right carb (73 2.0l dual solex
carbs) at the front of the throttle housing assembly.  I am into my 5th or 6th
carb pull to try to fix this problem and have had no luck.  The leak appears
to be coming out of the front of the shaft that goes through the throttle
housing assy.  I checked the archives and found little help.  This are the
things I have done:

replaced main body to throttle housing gasket
replaced manifold to carb gasket
removed and disassembled throttle housing (no apparent o rings to replace)
replaced with spare of unknown condition
tested solenoid (clicks with 12v)

Carbs have been sitting for about a year.  Please help.

Thanks,
Tom
