Actually, it doesn't.  I had a new battery with a cold-start relay and 
it still didn't start...

If you really want to fix the problem, find the issue that's actually 
causing the problem.  Usually this is corroded terminals, old wires, 
etc.  I would first start by looking at your battery terminals - are 
they nice and clean?  How do the battery clamps look - are they nice and 
clean?  If not, replace them!  That alone can make a world of difference.

If you really want to improve your starts, replace the main wire that 
runs from the battery to the starter as it's nice and old and probably 
pretty corroded under the battery clamp.  An easy one to change is the 
ground wire that runs from the battery to the chassis.  Clean up all of 
your connections at the starter (disconnect the ground wire first!) and 
put on new main battery terminals.  Be sure to clean the ground strap 
that runs from the transmission to the chassis as well.  I did all of 
that on my bus and it was amazing how fast it cranked over... *every* time!
