Subject: airs help in Helena Mt

My son is in Helena Montana on National Guard duty with a possible bad 
alternator in his 71 Riviera.
He has limited mechanical experience and tools.  He should have the money for 
parts etc but needs someone with a little experience in Type I motors to give 
an assist.
I'm out in Oak Harbor Washington working, I'm not much help since I can't lay 
eyes on his rig.
So far he says O'Reilly's tested the alternator and only registered 13volts. 
I'd also suggest testing his battery after a recharge since he's run it dead.
I have sources where he could get a used or rebuilt alternator w/in a day or 
two but he can't change it out on his own.
Any assist would be greatly appreciated and we would pay for time/fuel.
His name is Tyler Olsen, pls pmail me and I'll fwd our phone numbers.
thanks in advance for any help
