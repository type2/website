Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel pump question

It's not about pressure so much as volume. I ran the stock fuel pump in my
slightly modified (hp in the mid 70's) 1.8l for years (5) and never had a
problem with fuel supply. The only thing I didn't like about the stock fuel
pump was access to the top nut that holds it to the engine. I ended up
cutting an end wrench short just for this purpose.

If you don't have the Dellorto manual, you should get one, especially if the
carbs have not already been tuned for your engine. They are amazingly
generic out of the box, and have many adjustable features. They were hands
down my favorite. Now I'm fuel injected and California compliant (and slower
even with 200 more cc's).    :-(

One caveat: If the pushrod for the mechanical pump is worn down (shorter),
the pump volume will be lower. Get a new rod if you can before you install
the pump.
