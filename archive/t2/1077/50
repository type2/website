Hi Mike,

Are you looking for the part number only or are you actually looking  
for the part itself?

I have a trailer-load of parts I have been trying to flog at local  
swap meets and I know there is a usable 1975 throttle body or two in  
the pile. If the weather is good tonight I will dig it out and get a  
pic and part number for you.
