Subject: RE: [T2] vw bus question head spacer

hi,
sorry, i did forget to tell a bit more my story

1979 bloc, crank has been checked by machinist and is good. Cam has been
replaced, cam gear as well. I put stock 2000cc cyl and pistons from cip1.ca,
heads are from a rebuilder in California.

here are pics of the heads

and if possible i would like to know how to measure the cc, so i can have
peace at mind....
cheers, i really appreciate the help

Frank
Live to fly another day
