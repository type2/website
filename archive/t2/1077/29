I forgot you had ran a cable to the engine compartment - that would rule 
out a problem with your rear wiring.

Soooo.. what you could do is try pulling off the ignition plug up front 
and short out the wires and see if it kicks over.  Looking at the wiring 
diagram for a 78 (because I'm guessing you have something around a 78), 
you would want to short out the red wire (+12) to the red/black wire 
(starter solenoid).  If it kicks over the starter, then you know it's 
the switch.  If it doesn't, then you know it's the wiring... in that 
case, a relay at the back might help...
