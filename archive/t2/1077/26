Hi folks, I almost got my front end back together on the weekend,
except the lower shock mount nuts. I can't find a nut that fits. I
can't explain it. I have 2 nuts that look like they should fit...but
don't. I contemplated re-tapping them, but I thought I
 should ask, what is the CORRECT size and pitch for these nuts?
I want to pick up new hardware tonight, so that I can finish
 the install tomorrow. FWIW, with the new shocks in place,
 the van is definately taller now. Damn.


 ------------------------------

It is a BUS..... not a VAN!!!!!



The year of the BUS matters:

68-69 lower nuts are M10, part number N 11 010 4



1970-79 lower nuts are M12 x 1.5, part number N 11 020 2
