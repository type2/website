Subject: Re: [T2] Just a question (front tire- Marcus, note?)

My trivia is still evolving of course...

I believe you are correct, the ones in the museum were bumper mounted  
but not fastened on the nose. The bracket was designed to use the  
bumper's crash rating and leave the spare "floating". The others were  
aftermarket. But my trivia is limited to US spec buses for the most  
part. The DOT crash safety standards wouldn't allow for importing with  
a nose mounted spare, but it didn't keep dealers from throwing them on  
thousands of buses. The various European market crash standards may  
have allowed it as a "from factory" item.

I think we can thank ASI (makers of the Riviera) for popularizing the  
nose mounted spare in the US.

The spare tire mount offered from CIP1 and others is a nice  
compromise. http://www2.cip1.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=C27-J12975 
  but still expect some nasty damage from bumping into the wall in  
your garage. They do allow the spare to be used as a stepping platform  
though.
