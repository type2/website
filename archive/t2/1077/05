Subject: starting problem

since the weather has started getting warmer, and a few really hot days, I am having a starting problem more often. The starter will not engage with the switch, engine is cold, first start of the day. I ran a wire from the starter into the engine compartment and leave the key on, short the battery positive to the starter wire it cranks and starts. I can run at highway speeds all day long and if I keep the windows open and the cabin cool, it will start after I get fuel, if it's hot inside and the engine is cold it won't start. It's a '78 Federal. ???
