Subject: Fuel filler Problems

All of California's gas stations are putting in hoses with short nozzles. It
is impossible to fill up my 74 transporter because the nozzles will not
extend far enough into the filler tube and the fuel backs up and goes
everywhere or the nozzle shuts off. I'm considering making some kind of hose
extension adapter. Have any of you California bus owners found a solution
for this?
