Subject: vw bus question head spacer

Hi all,
new member to the awesome world of vw buses, i found a 79 westy in rough shape
and am planing to hopefully do what many of you guys and girls manage to do. I
set myself up, took the engine out and found no compression. Got a friends
bently manual, read up on the many articles and now i am rebuilding the
engine.
Going through the Bentley manual, i found it to be ambiguous weather or not to
install the shim between the cylinder head and cylinders. I also read what
richard atwell wrote about the subject and am still confused.
So please if possible, help me out on this one. I have stopped rebuilding the
engine just in case. Oh, and i have new clyinders, new heads(rebuild) and i
have put the shim at the bottom of the clinders...


Thanks,

Franky Cyr
