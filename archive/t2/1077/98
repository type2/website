Ok, so you measured a deck height of 0.645mm (0.025") - is that with or 
without any shims underneath the barrels - doesn't really matter because 
you'll still need more (see below).  Since you have a stock setup, your 
piston bore is 94mm, crank stroke is 71mm, and piston dish is 15cc, and 
you said your head chamber volume is 58cc.  Everything sound correct there?

Now, using the following numbers will yield a CR of 7.3:1:

Cylinder bore: 94
Connecting rod length: 0
Gasket bore: 0
Piston clearance: 0
Cylinders: 4
Head chamber volume: 58 (I believe this is actually the stock volume)
Piston dish: 15
Cylinder stroke: 71
Intake close ABDC: 0
Gasket thickness: 0
Top ring height: 0
Deck height: Inch(0.0295) (I put it in inches because everyone here 
measures shims in inches)

This means that you need a FINAL deck height of 0.7493mm (0.0295").

The CR that you have now based on your deck height measurements above) 
is 7.37:1.  If you put the stock 0.254mm (0.010") shim under the barrel, 
you'll end up with a final deck height of 0.889m (0.035") and that will 
give you a CR of 7.22:1.  If you want to be on the safe side, put the 
0.254mm (0.010") shim (which usually comes with the gasket kit) under 
the barrel and call it a day.

In my case, I purchased new heads that were brought down to 49cc, so I 
had to use 0.060" worth of shims to bring my total deck height to 0.084" 
so I'd have a CR of around 7.3:1.

Make sense?  Please double check my math as I could have gotten 
something wrong as I am getting different numbers than you did...
