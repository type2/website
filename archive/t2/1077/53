Actually, the bus (well, a 78 in my case) runs a max 41 degrees.  When 
you're driving at cruise speeds with at least 8inHg of vacuum, you will 
get an additional 11* of advance.  So, for example, when I'm driving on 
the freeway at around 65mph, my vacuum is hovering around 10inHg, RPMs 
are up in the 3000s which means that I have 32* of mechanical advance 
and another 11* of vacuum advance (41* total).  Remember, however, that 
vacuum advance is zero at full load and you're running only mechanical 
advance.

If you're curious, when you're running lean mixtures, you want to 
advance your timing (because the burn is slower), so that's why the 
timing is advanced.  If you keep leaning out the mixture, you can 
advance the timing more.  Contrary to popular belief, leaning out an an 
engine actually makes it run cooler.  I leaned out my engine to 17-18:1 
for a freeway run and the temps were hovering around 360 at 70mph!!  It 
didn't run very well in other gears, but that's just a matter of 
additional tuning and seeing if I can push advance the timing a bit 
further.  I don't want to do anything until I get my electronic 
stethoscope, though, so that I'll be able to hear knock if/when it 
occurs.  And... when you're running richer/hotter/high load/boost, you 
want to retard your timing.

You might want to read this thread - it's very informative on the topic:

I have recently switched over to electronic ignition control with the 
MegaSquirt so that's why I know all of this stuff.  Probably more than 
you really cared to know, but I thought I'd post it anyways ;)


btw, what is the application?
