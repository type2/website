Subject: Re: [T2] Anyone know the advance curve for the 74-75 Beetle  

Are we mixing up vacuums here?  Is this manifold vac vs something elso 
like throttle? When I posted that I was only getting around 28 deg 
advance and asked whether this was sticking weights or lack of vacuum, 
no one responded.  I checked the vac line to the distributor and got 
harly 5".  I checked the distributor canister and with a pump, got full 
distance after 10".  I replaced the vac line (indeeed frayed and cracked 
at the tight bend where it goes behind the throttle) it would climb into 
the 20" with the fullest throttle! Now the distributor works to about 40 
(counting the initial advance).  I did order the Mexican SVDA (Single 
Vac Dual Advance) from Bus Depot, asking here whether this can work in 
the FI busses, and Karl mentioned this was for Mexican beetles (listed 
for 74-75 bug here) and  total advance mechanically is not enough (about 
4-5 deg down).  Jim Thompson here said it was OK....stay tuned?

  get an additional 11* of advance.  So, for example, when I'm driving on
  the freeway at around 65mph, my vacuum is hovering around 10inHg, RPMs
  are up in the 3000s which means that I have 32* of mechanical advance
  and another 11* of vacuum advance (41* total).  Remember, however, that
  vacuum advance is zero at full load and you're running only mechanical
  advance.
