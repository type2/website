Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel filler Problems

I have a 76 Ford F150, and it has horrible problems with that. What a lot of
the 150 owners do (myself included) is by a foot or so of 3/4" ID fuel line
and keep it in the back. You have to listen for the gurgling that tells you
the fuel level is getting close, and it helps to know how much to expect is
going to go in there. But it's much easier than trying to finagle the nozzle
without it.

Hope this helps.
