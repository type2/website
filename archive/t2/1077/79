Well, pretty easy to tell if it's rust - do you have crap in your fuel 
filter?

Otherwise, if it's plugged (and the filter is clean and dry), siphon out 
what you can and then poke something in the fuel outlet of the tank and 
see what comes out.  Also, you might try draining the tank through the 
return side if you haven't already tried that.

If it is really bad, pull it out and bring it to a radiator shop to have 
it cleaned and dealt with...
