Subject: RE: [T2] Just a question

I would never again mount my spare on the front of my bus ... I do not
believe it will save you in an accident (except maybe at some slow speed
during which you would not have been that seriously injured anyway) ... when
the joker ran out in front of me and I hit him the repair cost like
$3,800.00 Cdn .. if the spare had not been on the nose I bet the damage
would have been just a new bumper .. I'd guess the impact was in the
neighbourhood of 20 kph.

The damage you see is almost 100% caused by the spare on the nose ...

BTW .. the other guy ran a stop sign so thankfully he was at fault.
