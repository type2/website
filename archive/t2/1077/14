Subject: pop-top hold down

I currently use turnbuckles to hold my top down ... I hate them ... the
rubber westy things won't work .... I need something better I would love to
come across some short bungee cords... the black rubber kind maybe 4" long
... or 3" long ... I'm looking for ideas as to what would work ...
