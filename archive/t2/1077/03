Subject: Signal wiring problems

My 71 bus has developed the following problems. LH signal makes the horn work.
Now the wipers don't work - they were fine till the signal problem started.
Now I have headlight problems too.  Headlights work on low but not on high.

So, what do I do.  Have never had any of these problems before.
