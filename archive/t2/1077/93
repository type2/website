wondering if I should have my head examined or is this not that big  a deal

more complicated than you might think  later mark  d

      Jon, this is a tough thing to say yay or nay, most would say nay


John
Well, I would like to thank everyone for the responses to my Tranny Question.
After a long time to think about it and a short time in the "hospital" (this
was decided when I had my head examined and they found out I owned a VW.  Not
to worry, everything is OK now.  I only hear Ferdinand Porsche talk to me 2- 3
times a day TOPS!!).  I have decided to Just get a rebuild.  I believe that
would be the best thing, as John mentioned I would need jigs and other tools.
If I were going to do more that one maybe, but at this point it wouldn't
justify the cost of tools.   Thanks again to all.
