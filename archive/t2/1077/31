Subject: Exhaust valve guide (?) problem in head

Hello List,

I've got the engine out of my '79 CA bus for cleaning and to install  
fuel injection (I'm finally saying goodbye to my Weber carb).  Just  
last night I removed all of the accessories from the engine and  
discovered something slightly disconcerting on one exhaust port of my  
3-4 cylinder head.

What I found is that the valve guide housing (the area cast into the  
head through which the valve guide penetrates) on cylinder 4's exhaust  
port is broken.  You can see the issue in the pictures at the  
following link.  I've included photos of the #3 exhaust port to show  
what the unbroken one looks like.

How big of a problem is this?  What can/should I do about it?

Thanks a lot!
Zack

P.S.  Is there a proper name for this part of the head?
