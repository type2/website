If you enjoy sitting by the road and trying to
burb coolant systems that include about 30 hoses.
 I don't know a vanagon owner who could say that,
honestly.  And anyone who told me that, I would
assume they have one for sale. 

I remember talking to Karl Mullendore at Everybus
about his TDI syncro.  Great rig.  And Karl has
forgotten more than most mechanics know.  When
someone asked if it was reliable, he replied
"....... well......"

Unadulterated VW corporate BS.  If it was the
green stuff or an American only problem, why did
VW South Africa switch to the Golf 4 cyl or
straight 5 cyl?  For that matter, why did VW
germany not use this wonderful design in the T4? 
Everyone I know, including those blue only buffs
like Karl Bloss and Ken Wilford, blow head
gaskets regularly.  Both of these guys had the
failure on a road trip.  The van gave no signs of
failure (like a slow leak or coolant loss) prior
to failing.    

Look on vanagon.com's faq page for an explanation
of the inherent silliness of the wasserboxer head
gasket design.  Gasket failure is guaranteed from
day one and gasket failure always results from
corrosion underneath the gasket where coolant is
held against the head.  Head repairs (welding) or
head replacement are always required.  

Here a detailed explanation:

I love diesels too.  I wish all vanagons and EV's
were diesel and that VWOA stocked diesel parts. 
They don't.

So reliable that there are a few hundred threads
everyone month of people with bucking vanagon
syndrome or no starts.  So reliable that most of
the list gurus on vanagon.com employ digitools to
attempt to track down gremlins.  The vanagon FI
is digital and drastically different than the AFC
found on an aircooleds.  But you'd know that just
by the ECU, right? 

The wasserboxer is so reliable that people are
willing to pay $3000-$7000 to put a subaru or
golf engine in the van just to get rid of that
pathetic wasserboxer.

A few hundred?  I'll buy the kit today and sell
them at the next event.  Who's selling them that
cheap?  

When I checked last, Ken Wilfy was much cheaper
than Bus Depot.  Here's a link with the schematic
of those silly hoses.  

http://www.vanagain.com/19lchc.htm 

$495 for all manual pipes
$595 for an automatic

Shipping extra.  

These hoses are NLA and Bus Depot (Ron's a good
man) and Wilfy (good man too) are selling NOS
pipes that have themselves aged on the shelves.  
There isn't enough demand for those old hoses to
interest the usual FLAPs hose suppliers. 

So you buy a set of hoses for $500-$600 and also
buy a spare set because there is no place in the
US except Vanagain and Bus Depot that have them. 
If one breaks on the road, your out of service
until Ron or Kenny get you the part.  

NOTE: this does not include those long pipes that
are no doubt rusted out on any vanagon that
hasn't spent it's life in Arizona.  As I recall
those are $300-400.  

Yes, vanagons are faster and ride much, much
better than a loaf bus.  And the later models
have decent airconditioning and power gizmo's,
but I'd buy an E150 or an Astro before I'd have
another.
