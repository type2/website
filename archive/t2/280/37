Subject: Bus auto Tranny's (auto owners opinions wanted!)

Hi guys,

It looks like I will be picking up a 79 westy with the auto tranny.  I've
actually driven this bus a fair amount already(its a friends bus) and I
really like the auto tranny.  I'm just curious as to just how strong they
are and if they have any particular problems, whats the long gevity like?
Down the road I could see building a bit bigger engine for the bus, and
don't want to have particular problems with it.  And lastly what is the
performance diff between an auto and 4spd, is it negliable?  thanks
Mike
