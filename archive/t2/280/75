Subject: Re: OK, sold 79, now I'm after a vanagon

I'll chime in here a little since I now have both a diesel Vanagon (makes
busses seem fast!) and a 2.1 wasserboxer.

A good, solid Vanagon will give you many miles of solid enjoyment. A poorly
cared for one will drive you crazy. Head leaks on the wasserboxers are a
concern, but only if the wrong coolant has been used - if it's green keep
looking or plan on eventually replacing the head gaskets (or even the
heads). Stock diesel's are slow as sin, but a 1.9TD bolts in the back with
zero mods. My 1.6 NA diesel gets in the low 30s while my 2.1 gets in the low
20s. Subtract 20% for westy's. The FI is pretty simple and reliable if it's
been taken care of - same as with the aircooleds. The hoses ARE the big deal
since there are many of them and eventually they wear out. Hose kits from BD
are a few hundred and that's $ well spent.

Golf engines WILL bolt into the back easily, but mods are needed to the
sheet metal or the engine hatch. Also, don't plan on dragging it into any
mechanic once you've done this - some will look at it and some won't. There
is also a South African engine kit from TIICO that requires no mode, however
parts are SA specific and it's not legal in CA.

Vanagons drive great provided they're wearing the right tires and there is
TONS of room inside. Good ones are mucho expensive, especially for Westy's.
I've seen plenty sell for up to five figures, although if you get one that
needs work the $ plummets. If it were me, and I had the time/$$, I'd get an
86 or newer Westy with a bad head and put the Golf engine in it.
