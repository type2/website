Subject: re New 1600cc engines.

I am inviting commentary from listees who have had experience with BAP
Import Parts in Arizona-they offer an all new(except for rebuilt con rods)
single port 1600 engine for $1095 outright. Looks great, anyone have any
experience or comments about this company's work or reputation? My
preference is for a single port, since I have the manifold and all other
parts for them, and prefer the design.
My other option is a new Mexican dual port longblock. Price is about $200
more with this, but you get a doghouse cooler with it. BAP says they use
Brazilian and German parts on their engines. I know a number of listees have
Mexican engines, including George Lyle.

Any commentary on this is welcomed, vis a vis the quality of the product and
companies involved. Tom
