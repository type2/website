Anyone know where to get the oil pressure relief plug version?
---------------------------------------
Audi 5000 Coupe has a oil pressure relief sender, fits Type IV so it will
fit others.
You need to buy some copper washers to shim it out but it is accurate.
Copper washers come from banjo bolts on Mazda RX7 oil cooler.
