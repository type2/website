One reason that stuff builds up there is that the threaded boss for the
drain plug extends upward into the plate, creating a "hump" for the heavy
particles to get caught on as the oil drains out.  It would be interesting
to modify a plate with the boss on the bottom side and see if the debris
still builds up.
