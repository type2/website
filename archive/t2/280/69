Hmmm, just about every engine I have seen with an oil filter also has a
screen on the pickup.  Why should a type 1 with an added oil fiter not
need one?

The first place a dislodged piece of metal goes is into the sump.  If
there is no screen, that piece of metal will likely go through the pump.
Steel might not get sucked up, but aluminum or magnesium are much more
likely to stay in suspension long enough.

The chances of a screen becoming clogged are very small, and removing the
strainer also eliminates the stagnent zone below the strainer, another
place where debris can sit harmlessly.
