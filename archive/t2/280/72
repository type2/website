I actually just ran across the Oil Temp in the Relief Valve while i was
thumbing through the Larry's Offroad catalog the other night.  Its listed on
their website at http://web.inetba.com/larrysoffroad/item105853.ctlg.  I've
never tried this but am curious?  I've got an email off to them about how it
works.
