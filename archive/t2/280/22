Hi Chris, & Craig,

    You might give this a try. While laying on a creeper, have someone
"bounce" the corner in question up and down. While the noise is happening,
very carefully "feel" each joint on the side making noise. There should be a
roughness, enough to feel in a dry or rough bushing, bearing, dry ball
joint, etc. Again be very careful where you put your hand/fingers.
    Once you find the culprit then you can make up your mind if you want to
fix it your self or go back to "Brand X" auto repair. This could be
something as simple as a dry bushing you can lube.
    Good luck.
