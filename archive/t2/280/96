Subject: Slider Adjustment ?

The track is there if I understand your description. I believe you are
describing the dog leg bend or J at the front of the track that should
pull
the roller towards the inside of the bus when closed. when the sliding
door
is closed the bottom front corner sticks out about 1/4" more than it
should.
If I lean on it I can push it in the 1/4" and feel the roller touch the
backside of the track. If the door is open 1/2 way I can push/ pull the
door
the same 1/4 inch against the track. It's as if the track is too wide or
the
roller is worn down to fit loosely in the track. I don't have anything
to
compare it to so I don't know if either is true. does anyone know the
dimensions of a new roller?

Thanks for the reply Tony, I can use all the help I can get.
