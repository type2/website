"the magnets may be strong, but there is a danger of them being removed by
accident.  When they are, a gout of metal particles will go through the
system all at once.  Not a pleasant thought."

Very true, but on the other hand, they still should have to pass through the
filter (assuming that you have one). Hopefully they've clumped together
enough that the filter will catch them. For the "unfiltered", I agree its
not a pretty thought, but I think the benefits outweigh the possible
negatives.
