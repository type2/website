Subject: Re: [T2] Thieves hit my westy! Help replacing front window!

When I lived in the big *hitty, I found that the best thief protection 
was to leave nothing in the vehicle worth stealing and leave it 
unlocked.  Experience taught me that whatever was stolen was *always* 
worth less that the amount of damage done getting into the car. 
ALWAYS! $25 stereo = $250 worth of damage. $10 stereo = no damage. (Not 
worth stealing...)
