Probably a good choice.  Vanagon manuals are
cursed with a weakness in the 3/4 gears and often
loses those gears.

I can only speak for the wasserboxer.  17mpg,
city, highway, uphill, downhill, loaded,
unloaded, 17 mpg.  US gallons so you'll have to
do the math.

It depends on whether you can afford to replace
the 275 feet of hoses (the whole set is $500-700)
and, of course, the head gaskets every few years.
 Also the fuel injection is finicky. 

Other high failure items, the metal or plastic
coolant lines that run for and aft, the gas tank
will be rusted out on top, the rubber components
and filler neck will need replaced, the front and
rear heater blowers will need replaced, the rear
heater will leak.  Price this stuff prior to
buying a vanagon so you will know the total cost.
 

If I were buying a wasserboxer, and mind you I
cannot think of a reason I would, it would be a
2.1.  The hoses and fuel injection components for
these are somewhat cheaper.  Some of the 1.9
components are NLA.  Also, list member DArrell
Boehler makes a "digitool" to help you diagnosis
the various known fuel injection issues.

I'd be tempted to buy a vanangon with a blown
head gasket and put a golf engine in it.  There
are complete kits, including 0 mile engines
availalbe, as well as folks who will help you put
that used golf engine from your junkyard in
yours.  A diesel vanagon would be a good
candidate, as the golf engine bolts right up to
the diesel bellhousing (of course there are other
mods necessary).  

Others put a subaru engine in their vanagon.  

I posted a few of these links this week when
someone asked about bolting a diesel into a loaf.
 Also, the vanagon.com list discusses these
issues weekly, if not daily.  

Buena suerto
