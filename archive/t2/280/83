This would be a great wrecking yard business to start, or a lot of
restorables out there. Hidden treasures everywhere. Vehicles are in various
stages from complete to just a shell. Some need just engines while others
need everything with a perfect body to start with. Don't let this pass you
by. Lots of treasures. 

Located in the Sacramento area (Rio Linda).
