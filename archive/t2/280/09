Be sure to ask the Vanagon list the same question as there are more of your 
type of vehicles there.

Were the suspension bushings replaced with rubber or nylon type bushings. 
The rubber type are OEM and the nylon type is aftermarket "performance" and 
they make noise.

Did the noise start with the wishbone bushing replacement or was it doing 
it before hand?

I think there are rubber mounts between the spring and the suspension and 
body - maybe one of these is missing.

Have you verified that there are not grease fittings in there that need 
attention? The older cars had these that had that type of suspension.
