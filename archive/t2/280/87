Subject: Re: Oil Change Interval

>>BTW, I'm going to install a temperature sender I took from a 914 in the
sump plate and replace the leaky gasket there while I'm at it.  Someone told
me once I have to shave some of the end of the dipstick to get it to clear
the temp sender?<<

Richard -
I have all the necessary components (including extra dipstick) and have been
meaning to do this job for a couple of years now, but have been
procrastinating as you can see.  Anyway, yes, from my over-research on the
subject it seems evident that you will need to actually hacksaw about 3/4"
off the end of the dipstick to make it short enough so it doesn't hit the
914 sender when pushed in.  I haven't done this yet, but am told that it has
no bearing on the length you need to measure the oil level.  One time I
actually measured 3/4" off the end of my existing dipstick and it didn't
look to take anything vital off the end.

I think one of the reasons I haven't done this job yet is not wanting to
deal with the oil leak I predict to be inevitable when I remove the existing
sump plate and replace it with the 914's -- I have never had any leaks there
ever and I guess I don't want to chance starting one anew.  Anyway, please
let me know how this goes for you (and where you obtained a replacement for
your leaky sump plate gasket) -- maybe your success will get me going on
finally getting mine out of the way.  Thanks!

p.s. I vote for changing oil at 3k...
