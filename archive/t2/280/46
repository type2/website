I have one too...I love it. I searched the east coast for my van, and I turned
down numerous manual vans before I stubled upon mine 20 miles from my house in
Canada. Strange.

Anyway, I agree with Bob, the auto transmissions are getting old, but they are a
strong unit, and if maintained, a reliable unit. I tow with my bus regularly
(towed my split home a few weeks ago), I drive it daily, it climbs hills as well
as a 4-spd, coupled with a 2.0L, it accelerates as well as other vehicles. What
I love about the auto tranny is the smoothness, they are fantasitic. They are a
3-spd unit and I HIGHLY recommend them. I would not switch to a 4-spd if you
paid me.

But, all this depends on the health of the current tranny, does it shift
smoothly, at the proper RPM? Does it leak? Clunk?

If it drives well, it is worth it...
