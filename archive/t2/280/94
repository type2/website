Subject: airtight engine compartment?

Volks-

I went out to my '78 Westy today and was poking around at the engine when I 
discovered that I have "lost" much of the material around the engine that 
seals the engine comparment from the elements, etc. This stuff is like some 
type of foam, and its all disintigrating when I touch it. Is there a 
replacement sold or should I try to stuff something else in there?
