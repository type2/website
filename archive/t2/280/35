Subject: Sapphire radios found!

Hello there!

I hope someone can point me in the right direction...

You see, I never pass up the chance to investigate a salvage yard
I find secretly holding old a/c VWs.  Today, I found an old
country road wrecker with a number of square-window Bugs, a
couple Squarebacks and a really, really sad Splitty.

All of them had Sapphire radios, ranging from Sapphire I to XI.
Could you point me in the direction of a VW Sapphire FAQ?

I thought that I might go pull those old radios and make them
available to restorers here on type2, on thesamba.com and and
Ebarf.  Two things being accomplished: help someone find the
radio they're looking for & make a few bucks to fund my own Westy
restoration.

I'm looking specifically for info on...

What years/models had what model of Sapphire?
How much are they generally worth?
Are there any that are particularly in demand?
Are there any that aren't particularly in demand?

Just thought I'd take a stab at it...

Thanks for your time.
