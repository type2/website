Courtney,
With an automatic and a Westy version, I recommend getting a water cooled
model.  The Vanagon is much heavier than your current bus.  I like my air
cooled Vanagon Westy, but it's so slow it's dangerous on on ramps and
hills.  The slightest upgrade has one down shifting, and this is a on a
fresh re-build (by me) that was reported as "strong" by a VW engine
re-builder after he set up my rebuilt motor.

I'd personally consider doing an engine conversion to start - either Suby
or VW in-line. There is a yahoo group for the suby conversion - KEP is
one of the companies that sells a conversion kit.  Tiico, sells a in-line
VW kit with a new motor.  Either is not totally turn-key, but heck
neither is putting in a re-built motor for that matter.  Boston Bob might
have a higher out-put WasserBoxer to put in it also - that might be the
easiest route - but Bob only sells motors, does not install and set them
up to the best of my knowledge.

Check www.vanagon.com and www.bcn.net/!LiMBO for info and ads.

Like all busses, it is probably most economical to find the best bus that
you can afford - although one with a fried engine might be a good find
for a conversion, but 100 other people are doing the same.

My $0.02 - your mileage might vary
