Steve,

Might be lots of things....check wiring and voltage regulator first....

but!  just unhook the generator electrically(cover hot wires with tape for 
sure) and then pop the belt off of it.

Start the engine and run on just the battery for less than 2 
minutes....cause no cooling fan.

Then you know if it is engine or generator.

I have had a generator lock up in the middle of a parade and made
the engine seem like it was locked up....wouldn't turn over or anything!

Cheers, dave
