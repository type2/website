Subject: Subject: re New 1600cc engines. 

I recently bought a 1600 engine from BAP for my
71 Type 2 camper.  I have 3000 on it so far.

I spent the extra money to have a new engine, complete
with cooling shroud and alternator.  I previously had
a generator.

I did end up changing the intake manifold because
I need the port for my brake booster.  I received
the engine within five days, packed nicely in a plywood
case.  I picked it up at the trucking company and
they used a fork lift to load it in thru my side door. 

So far...I'm happy....I think my total cost was around $1835 with
shipping to New York.

It started up right away.
