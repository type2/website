I agree with the vacuum idea. Compressed air can blow the grit deeper
into the engine. After removing as much as possible with a vacuum
consider using an aluminum safe solvent to wash things down such as carb
cleaner. Be sure that where ever you spray the solvent that it runs off
the engine, NOT deeper into the engine. If you are using solvent on any
steel or cast iron parts finish the cleaning with a clean well oiled
lint free rag. Constantly check for grit in the rag, you don't want
to scratch any machined surfaces.

    I have seen the damage sand can do to an engine in short order. Once
helped rebuild a type 1 engine that ingested way too much sand dune in
Yuma Arizona due to a backwards slide down a too steep, tooo tall dune
climb. Stuffed the engine in the sand and the oil filler cap popped off
admitting maybe a hand full of sand. The owner drove it about 2 miles to
the trailer. Not a pretty sight inside when we tore it down!

The moral of the story is be meticulous in cleaning out that grit. Do
everything you can to keep it from going any deeper into the engine as
quickly as you can.
Hope this helps,
Tom
