Paul,

I feel very badly for you :-( I read thru the other responses, but I
cannot recommend other than a complete teardown, wash, and reassembly.  I
would use solvent and lots of it. I would probably tear it down, bring the
bits to my machinist and let *him* wash them.  And out of politeness, I
would tell him what he was getting (he will probably not want to reuse
that solvent!).

I have never done this to an engine (sprayed it with sandblasting
material), but that stuff is *designed* to cut! and as you use it, it
breaks down into dust, as you have probably found.  Even the dust, tho,
will still cut.  I think you have to eliminate *all* of it or risk a very
short-lived rebuild.
