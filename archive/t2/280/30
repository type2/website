the magnets may be strong, but there is a danger of them being removed by
accident.  When they are, a gout of metal particles will go through the
system all at once.  Not a pleasant thought. George Lyle
----------------------------------------
I've been running my magnets for five years, I've never lost one (the
original one).
The material that collects in the strainer plate is also magnitized and
is fairly tough to scrape out.
I can't say that it could not get scraped off but after the breakin
period of 8000 miles, there just isn't much there at 3000 intervals on
oil changes.
If I've by hook or crook kept my engine from circulating the iron filings
for the first 8000 miles then Free is well worth it.
