OK, I knew this would draw some ire ... as always, be your own mechanic. In 
the meantime here's an excerpt from the Gene Berg article I refered to in my 
first post, copied and pasted from his company's Web site:

Oil strainer information. An area of extreme importance. The inlet or 
suction side of any pump is extremely limited in what it can do as compared 
to the pressure side and should never be impaired in any way, whereas the 
pressure side is capable of overcoming a great deal of extra resistance. For 
that reason, I have not used the stock oil strainer in any of my high 
performance street or race engines since 1966. I found that it often caused 
too much restriction on the suction side of the oil pump with a little 
higher performance and high RPM engines. This problem was traced to oil 
starvation and all out bearing and/or crankshaft failures from the oil not 
being able to pass through the stock restrictive oil strainer screen fast 
enough to provide adequate flow to the pump.

Contamination was a concern, however, all of my engines from 1961-on had 
full flow oil filters protecting the engine. Some concern about metal 
particles going into the oil pump before filtering was solved when I went to 
the farm supply house and bought a "cow" magnet that is about 1/2" round by 
3" long. I hose clamped it on the outside of the pickup tube extension for 
the larger sump. I have used this configuration successfully for over 30 
years. For those that do not know, a cow magnet is what they feed the cows 
to pick up metal (such as broken barbed wire) from the stomach and pass it 
out of their system.



... and, we are brought full circle back to the original thread, about 
magnets. Eggggcellent.

Your points are good ones, George. What you're doing works for your engine 
(and peace of mind) and that's what matters. But, if we agree that you 
shouldn't drop a bolt into your engine, then neither of us should need the 
oil strainer. There is, I admit, always a chance of a piece of metal getting 
pulled up into the pump but let's face it, if that happens you've already 
got some problems. If it fits through the pump, the filter will catch it, if 
not, new oil pump. But then you'd probably be taking the case apart anyway 
to find out where that honking chunk of steel/aluminum/babbit metal came 
from, right?
