Subject: shift linkage bushing for 83 vanagon

Have an 83 vanagon, which according to bentley has the
091 tranny.  Seems like none of the main suppliers
sell the replacment shift linkage bushings, i.e. they
all sell replacement bushings for the 091/1 tranny for
80-91 vanagons when the 091 transmission and linkages
were used until mid 86.  The 091 has a LOT less parts
and only one or two bushings, but it looks different
than the diagrams for the older 091 trannies in the
busses.  Where can I find the correct bushings and/or
part numbers?
