Subject: Slider Adjustment?

L was looking for the cause of the wind noise on my 75 passenger bus and
noticed the sliding door is the cause. The door fits with an equal gap
all the way around but the bottom front corner seems to stick out just
enough to prevent the door from sealing. I have looked at the bottom
roller assembly and see no way to adjust it. I see where Bentley
indicates shims can be used but I think this only helps with up/down and
fore/aft adjustment of the closed gap around the door, not the in/out
adjustment. Do I need a new roller on the bottom bracket to pull the
door in tighter when closed? If so where might I find one?
Thanks
Tom
