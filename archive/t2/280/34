Hello all.  First let me apologize if this came through as HTML.  I use 
Compuserve/AOL so I can't turn it off.  If it comes through that way, I'll 
re-subscribe from a web-based mail service.

I'm not actually an owner, yet.  I know nothing about VWs and even less about 
air-cooled engines.  I'm a diesel and gas mechanic, I just have no experience 
with air.  I have my eyes on a nice 73 transporter.   I need a favor before 
anything else.  There is an ebay auction of this 1973 bus.  The owner ended 
the auction early due to a few reasons. (long story)  Here's the scoop on the 
bus.  I went to see it, drove it, and it is in very nice shape.  He described 
it very well in the auction, and he is a very calm, honest, Christian guy.  
There is no doubt its a good bus.  The question is this:  He wasn't too 
anxious to sell and had reserve in the area of $5000.  (I don't want to tell 
the reserve in case he re-lists it).  He is realizing it may not bring that 
much.  I wasn't sure if it was a Delivery or Campmobile (like I said, I'm 
clueless on Vdubs) but NADA puts low retail at $3600 for the Delivery and 
$6175 for low retail on the Campmobile.  How much should I offer?  How much 
should I pay?  Its ready to drive as-is.  He and I are talking around the 
number of $3000, but someone else is making an offer as we speak.  The 
auction number is 1871124686 .  If you just paste that in to the search 
window it will take you right to it.  I'm sorry if that's bending the rules 
about fleabay posting.  I'm not advertising as the auction is over, just 
telling you where you can see it if you want to give an appraisal.

Looking forward to meeting you all!!!
