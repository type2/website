Subject: Running Slightly Behind

A 40 foot container arrived from Europe this week - over 10,000 Volkswagen
parts.  It took us two solid days to unload it and put it all away.
Meanwhile, every inch of the shop floor was piled floor to ceiling with
stacks of boxes. We could barely even walk across the shop, much less ship
orders, until we put everything away.  Not surprisingly, this put us
slightly behind schedule on shipping standard ground orders.  We normally
ask you to allow 7-10 working days for delivery of ground orders, and have
generally been delivering much faster than that.  (In fact, until recently
we've been shipping most orders in about one business day.)  But for the
next week or so, we'll probably be running up toward that 10 day mark more
often than not on current/new ground orders.

Expedited orders (next day, second day, third day shipping) will not be
affected in any way, as they take priority over everything else we do in the
shop (even unloading containers).  In many cases it hardly costs more to
upgrade to expedited delivery, so as always, if you're in a rush that is
your best bet.

We expect to be caught up in a week or less.  In the meantime, it would be a
HUGE help if you would try to use the website and email for your orders and
questions, rather than calling, wherever possible.  (sales(-at-)busdepot.com)
Some of our phone reps are boxing orders to catch us up, and if we can bring
the phone volume down for just a few days we'll be caught up in no time.
Your patience and understanding is greatly appreciated.

This container had a bunch of '68-79 stuff - a few gems among them.  I'll be
in Vegas next week for the auto parts industry show, but will post a list of
the new goodies as soon as I return.  In fact, if you're getting ready to
order parts, but aren't in a big hurry, there's no harm in waiting 'til then
in case you want to add any of the new items.

Stay tuned.
