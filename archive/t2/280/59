Subject: OK, sold 79, now I'm after a vanagon

Well the 79 is moving on now to someone who will restore it , so I'm now on the hunt for a vanagon Westy and am asking the usual question, water or air, which year, etc etc. The only thing I am after definitely is the automatic tranny, and am curious about gas mileage and reliability of the vehicles. This is the last machine my wife and I want to purchase as it will be our retirement vehicle for travel around North America so has to be a good one. Can anyone review the various options in the years and the introduction of new features throught the Vanagon's production? I am NOT interested in the Eurovans. I would appreciate any info, thanks!!! Do the auto vanagons get decent gas mileage? My auto 79 Type2 got 20-21 mpg (big Canadian gallon) Muchos Gracias amigos!!!
