Subject: CA VW Electronic Ignition questions

Hi All:

I just received the replacement CA Ignition and FI system (thanks Karl)
for my 82 Federal Vanagon and want to test it out. I have some questions
about the ignition wires, rotor and coil to use.

Currently I have the Bosch 09171 wire set on my point based system with
the Bosch 03010 cap and 04033 rotor. I am using the Flame-thrower coil.
From Bentleys I gather that I need a new rotor, wires and must use the
CA coil (which I have).

Looking at Bus Depot catalog, I don't see another wire set for the CA
ignition. Is it only the rotor and coil that have to be swapped? Will
the 09171 wire set work? The newer Vanagons had complete electronic
ignition systems. They have to use the Bosch 09180 wire set. Should I
use this instead? What happens when the old coil dies, can I use the
Flame-thrower coil, and if not what other replacements are available?

Lastly I have seen post regarding leaving the advance/retard vacuum
hoses connected and disconnected when setting the idle/timing. My 85
Bentleys states both. Which should it be?
