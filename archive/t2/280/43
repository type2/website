Bob,

Let me take you on a history tour to show why I think the divider is
important, but that you can live without it.  Up 'til the mid 60s, *all*
vans were bench seat.  At some point during the 60s, walkthru becaem an
option, but even on the walk-thrus, there was a big muckin' panel welded
in behind each front seat.  Over time, that walk-thru became the standard
and the bench the option, but the bulkheads stayed to the maximum extent
possible.  In the mid 70s, with the introduction of the swivelling seat
in the Wesies, the bulkheads finally *almost* disappeared.  If you look at
a '78/9, tho, you will still see a triangular gusset welded in between the
B-pillar and the seat support.

As I see it in my minds eye, there was a running battle between the
engineers (that bulhead is *IMPORTANT*!  It keeps the body form
racking!!!) and the sales staff (that bulkhead is a major downer for
customers!  they hate it!)  and in the end, we all know who wins those
battles :-( I tend to agree with the engineers.  The bus is a squared off
tube with bulkheads at the front and rear (and even they have square holes
cut in them) and is subject to substantial racking forces. We all know how
dimensionally stable a box is, especially with the ends out of it.  Any
reinforcement you can get in the middle is a good thing!

I would advise leaving what you have alone, replacing what was cut if you
can, and living in confidence that it is not a total bus-wrecker if it is
gone.
