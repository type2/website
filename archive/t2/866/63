Subject: Re: [T2] spray on bed liner on undercarriage?

<<The Duplicolor bed liner I have seen was too brittle and broke away
from the metal. Conventional undercoatings are either a tarry substance
or wax. I had success with swamp cooler coating as it also contains rust
inhibitors.>> 




John,

Ya ought to gve Morton's Bed Liner a shot---

It's been on the bottoms of my Bus, & Vanagons for 5 years and hasent'
moved , chiped, faded, peeled, or cracked inthat amount of time--

Especially evident is in the wheel well area's and the traling arms of
the Vanagon's.
They still look as new with the Mortons Bed liner on top of them--and as
solid as a rock.

Morton Part Number 1420-13

You'll like it--it'll like you
