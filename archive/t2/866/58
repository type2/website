Subject: R key blanks

The black plastic-headed blank shown in the photo appears to be manufactured 
by Silca in Italy.  It could be either nickel plated brass or nickel plated 
steel.  Those destined for the US, when Silca was imprted into the US, were 
brass.  The rest of the world got steel.  We keep these in stock, though 
they aren't generally available in the US.  It's a good key.  We also 
occasionally get Borkey plastic heads out of Germany, and on occasion, see 
ILCO plastic-heads made here in the US.  Most locksmiths aren't going to 
have any of them, though.
