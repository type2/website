Subject: Re: [T2] Solex versus Brosol experiences ?

I am in the process of transcribing original jetting specs for Beetle, Ghia
and Type 3 carburetors to html to upload to my website.  I typed this chart
(talk about old school!) back in 1984 when a carb rebuilder wanted to know
what proper jets to use on his production line (he was a great rebuilder,
too bad he closed and retired).  If you will note, Beetles used different
(larger) main & air correction jets than the Type 2.  New Brosols these days
are coming with 127 or 130 main jets, ergo they're set up for the Beetle.
Different load characteristics of the Type 2 make this jetting profile a bit
on the rich side:

Beetle 1971 34PICT3 (MT or Auto)
Main Jet 130
Air Correction Jet 75/80z
Idle Pilot 60

Type 2 1971
Main Jet 125
Air Correction Jet 60z
Idle Pilot 57.5 (superseded to 55 as replacement)

Main jets are available thru any EMPI distributor.  Air correction jets
might be a bit harder to find (unless you have your old carburetor, in which
you can just re-use it).
