Subject: Re: [T2] Front (anti) sway bar clamps

West Coast Metric (WCM) sells the complete kit that is remade to 100%
original spec. It comes with the clamps, busings and brackets. They bolted
on perfectly to my 68 front beam and 79 front beam.

Part Number 211-101B for $19.75
It comes as a set for both mounts.

Hope this solves this mystery.
