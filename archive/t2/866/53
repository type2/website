I lucked on a few of these blanks at AAA Locksmiths in Dublin, CA. 
There's a VW dealer there I thought might be able to dup a few for me, 
but they sent me to AAA.

This key is NICE.  The ignition is in such an akward place anyway, this 
really alleviates key cut on the crankin' hand.  Much easier to get a 
grip on.

If anyone's really interested, I don't think he has any more, but he 
might be able to dredge up where he got 'em.  If anyone wants the 
number, p-mail.
