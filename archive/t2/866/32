Subject: Solex versus Brosol experiences ?

Has anyone on the list compared 'equivalent' Solex and Brosol/Bocar on
the same engine ?

OR Has anyone on the list compared a Solex 34 PICT versus a
Brosol/Bocar 34PICT on the same engine ?

And does anyone on the list have a Solex 34PICT for sale. That someone
should be willing to state on the list's honour that this 34PICT
regularly gave more than 20mpg in a dual port bus.

I get ~15 mpg on rebuilt stock 1600 engine with 34 PICT new Brosol

my previous 1971 same bus gave 22+mpg in the same town with a stock
Solex. Same commute similar fuel.
