I figured it out.  When I get the weatherstrip adhesive it should hold in there nicely.  Thanks....KR

>Hey,  Guys. I just got a new seal for my engine compartment door. Haven't had  one on it since I got the bus. Question is: which way does it go? I  tried it with the thicker part toward the engine and it doesn't seem to  fit. Does the thinner side go to the back and the thicker side fits  around the outside of the door? Also, what would be the best glue to  use on it? I'm thinking this will keep the engine compartment cooler.  Thanks...KR

See my photos for help:

Use weatherstrip adhesive.
