I think he got the Sunset Warranty..... when the sun
sets, the warranty ends.

Or the 30/30 Warranty.....  30 ft or 30 seconds,

Or the Taillight Warranty.... "as soon as I can't see
your taillights, the warranty ends".....

Guarantee" you ask, that is where "If it breaks in
half, you get both halves".
