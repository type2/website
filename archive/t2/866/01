Looks like no-ones replied so I'll stick in my 2cents. 'Sides I have three
engine stands.
The bench mount stand is good for assembling the crank and the bottom end, I
wouldn't hang anything heavier than a short block type one from it. To make
one from a rolling stand isn't that expensive or hard-Harbor frt and others
sell cheap 1ton stands and to modify a bellhouseing only requires drilling
one hole, plus now you can mount a starter and run your new motor.

If none of this works, you could use the cheap one to assemble the bottom
end and then move it to the bench to install the p/c's and rest.
