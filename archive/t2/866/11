I go 29 I get on at 64 W. 29 from there is real nice. They have changed it  
since last year so watch the signs. They cut out some town areas. I'll be  
leaving about 9 PM on Thursday so I'll keep an eye out for anyone in  need. I'll 
be in a bright green and white 67 pulling a little camper  trailer.
