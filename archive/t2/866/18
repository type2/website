hmmm,  a trip to Richmond may be in order...are they open Sundays?? are
they pick and pull or do you have to "know" what you want??  and of course
how are the prices?  hmmm, maybe link up with some other locals (Barry?)
and do a group scavange/recovery.  could share tools that way too. only
need one of each heavy tool.  (if it is like Crazy Rays it costs a $1
every time you run to your bus for something you forgot)
