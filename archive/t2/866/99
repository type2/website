Subject: Re: [T2] Are the Asian CV joints any good?

I have been running Asian-made CV Joints and Boots on my 84 Westy (same as
the 68-79 Bay Window) (all four joints) for just over two years now.  Nary a
problem with any clicking or clacking and the Boots have lasted far
longer than I would have expected, even more than some so-called "German"
Meiserwhatiz or Febi Boots I've used in the past.  My van has been sort of a
test "guinea pig" for these and I have very pleased with them.

VWG/Airhead Parts directly imports them from the manufacturer, who also
happens to be the OEM supplier to Nissan, Mazda, Toyota & Honda.  In
addition, they have a special section of the factory devoted to the OE
manufacture of CV joints and related for Volkswagen, both for their domestic
Chinese vehicle production and is now supplying replacement joints and boots
to VAG for worldwide distribution through their depots.  My employer, while
touring the factory also saw evidence that companies like Lobro are now
contracting with them for their replacement inventories for other vehicle
makes that Lobro originally supplied to.  Get with it folks, more and more
"OE" stuff is beginning to be funneled through Germany/Europe from sources
such as China and will increase as time goes on.
