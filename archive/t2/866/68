Subject: Re: [T2] [Q] Engine Smoking

<<The engine produces a good deal of smoke when coming down a hill (e.g.
taking my foot off the gas, leaving it in gear, letting the wheels drive
the engine).>>

Sounds to me as the oil is being sucked passed the valve guides during
decleration.

Perhaps the rebuilder by-passed the guide replacement.

I'd take a look at them first, install valve stem seals, have them
knurled or just replace them.

This will cure the problem.
