IMO - it just does not make sense to spray the underside of your own 
vehicles. I used bar and chain oil once and I'm sure it does a good job and 
it is pretty cheap .. likely under $25.00 - but it makes a real mess where 
ever you apply it and unless you have a hoist - it is really tough to get 
right under the bus and spray the stuff with whatever kinda wand you use. I 
say - just take your bus to Krown or another good shop and let them do it.
