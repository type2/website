Your jets are in the ballpark for a 32/36 on either 1.8 or 2.0 liter and definitely not too far on the rich side. at any rate you can burn a lot of gas with the progressive especially around town in stop-and-go. After double-checking timing and dwell, lean out your idle mixture screw counter-clockwise 1/4 turn at a time then test-drive and see if it doesn't die on you, tune for "lean best running idle." You might get by with a 55 main idle jet then you would have to back out the screw again. I wouldn't go leaner on any of the others BUT hint--there is an "extra enrichment passage" that can be plugged in the secondary to limit wasting fuel there, then you figure out a bigger sec. main (~165-170) to compensate. . . leave your other jets as you have them for VW:

no flames please. . . 

I might have a few of these jets laying around. . . just give me a call.
