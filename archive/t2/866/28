I'd contact the vendor about those clamps...The stock swaybar clamp
is a shorter in diameter at the front than at the back; it's also roughly
"D" shaped... The picture above doesn't "seem" to be the same...It
looks like a plumbing part (I could be wrong...) that's used as a clamp
over a repair patch on hard-to-reach/remove pipes...Any "real"
plumbers wanna verify that...Like I said I'm just goin' by the picture... ;-(
