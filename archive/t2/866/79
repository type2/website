Hi Dave,

    Is this a recent rebuild? Did he replace the pistons and cylinders? Is
it using a lot of oil? I'm assuming you have checked the oil level and it's
not over filled. Sounds like you have an internal engine problem.
    When an engine is coasting in gear, and as you say going down hill, with
the throttle closed. It produces its highest vacuum. Any place that controls
oil, rings, piston to cylinder, valve guides, etc that has to much
clearance. Will allow excess oil to be drawn into the cylinders and burnt.
    If it's smoking as much as you indicate, I don't think it's all coming
through the valve guides. There's not that much oil available there unless
your push rod tubes are stopped up. (most unlikely) Not to say the guides
aren't worn, but I would suspect the rings/piston/cylinders as your problem.
     Are you under some type warranty? Or did you get the "Oklahoma
Guarantee"? What's the "Oklahoma Guarantee" you ask, that is where "If it
breaks in half, you get both halves".
    Sounds like time for a re-rebuild, by another mechanic!

Good luck, let us know what you find.

Howard
