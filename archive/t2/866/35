Subject: Re: [T2] Solex versus Brosol experiences ?

it's also worth noting that if you have used a wideband on these
applications, you'll find the A/F was 11.5:1 in most cases, So change to a
50-55 idle to clean the mosquito fogger up a tad.

these carbs DO NOT NEED A 60 IDLE JET. People jet them pig rich so the
customer doesn't whine about hesitation, and they rarely complain about poor
MPG.
