Subject: spray on bed liner on undercarriage?

hello,
i was looking at the bed liner of my work truck and noticed the spray on
bedliner.  what would this look like on the undercarriage of my bus?  in the
wheel wells, etc?  my work truck bed gets quite abused and gets mortar,
grout, cement, acid, sand, tile and every imaginable type of trash in it and
it, the bedliner, looks pretty nice.  anyone know how this would hold up
against road salt and what-not?
