Has anyone tried the exhaust clamp for type1 AFM reading :

It looks like the O2 sensor is screwed outside the tailpipe, wondering
if it ever gets warm enough on the type1. For sure on the stock
exhaust, the tailpipe must be removed.

What is the temperature required for the wideband O2 sensor to work ?

instrument readings.
