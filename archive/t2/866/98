Subject: Re: [T2] Are the Asian CV joints any good?

I'm in the same boat: looking for CV's, and have done
quite a bit of shopping around. 
I think that the German Lobro kit
(joint+boot+grease+bolts) for $54.95 from Bus Depot
has got to be the best deal out there.

If you are selling your bus next month and have no
conscious for the next owner, the go Asian, but I'd do
the above if you want something close to OG quality
and reliability.
