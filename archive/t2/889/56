Are you able to seal around the engine in the engine bay, or do you see the 
ground?  This would be just as critical, for you will be sucking hot air 
from the motor back into the engine if this is not sealed up.  I did not see 
a post that said you had used the type 4 to type 1 conversion 
tin................or if you have a European bus with a type 1 motor in it.
