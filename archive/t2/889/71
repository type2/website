The key to the oil analysis is to look for trends.
Perform another test(s) at the same mileage interval
and compare the results.  Yours was with a new engine
so you may want to perform a couple more tests over
the next year or two and see how the results compare.
Don't include too many variables, like switching oil
brands, etc between tests.

It's somewhat like reading the results from a blood
test.  :-)  You have more information about what's
going on inside.

I used Performance Analysis Company in Knoxville, TN
a few years ago.  They tested my MB turbodiesel's oil
several times with kits which came in a three-pack.
The price per test was about $15, IIRC.

The results included Fe, Al, Cu, Cr, Pb, Sn, Na, "dirt",
"soot", fuel, water, "solids", glycol & viscosity levels
from the 1 oz. dirty oil sample I mailed them.
