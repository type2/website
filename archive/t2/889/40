Road trip!

;-)

The octane question has come up before. It's a given that under some
conditions you can drop a few degrees of head temps. The question is exactly
what conditions.

Without an elaborate analysis of each engine, it seems to me the dollar or
two per fillup difference is still worth it as a "just in case".

But pay attention to your bus! When I run super here in CO the Guac actually
runs worse. The mid-grade is ideal. So that's what I use. When I visited CA
I threw super in just to see. Ran better than midgrade. So you really need
to pay attention to what your bus likes and what conditions you're driving
in.
