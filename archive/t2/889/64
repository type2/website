sorry everyone.   i am very sorry. i did not mean to offend.  i am working
on a 78 transporter with a 2.0 l fuel injected.   the advice joe gave me
with the wooden dowel was the trick.  i just happened to have some 5/16
wooden dowel around the house,   i cut about a foot of it and hammered it in
the void and viola.   out comes the gear.  thank you very much joe, and mark
again i get in a hueey sometimes and forget the details.   i hope in the
future i remember my manners.  thenk you too mark
