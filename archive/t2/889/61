me out here.   anyone in the  athens georgia area out there.  i am having a
devil of a  time.



hello ???      first tell us what we are working  on, what year, type motor 
etc.  Type 1 motors you have to remove the fuel  pump and stand.  I have used 
pencials. screwdrivers, metal rods and blind  pullers that were made for this.  
You will have to twist the drive as you  pull it up. remember that there are 
washers on the bottom of the drive itself  and they can fall off . last sign 
your posts as a courtesy and so we know who we  are addresting later  mark
