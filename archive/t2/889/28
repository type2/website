Subject: Re: [T2] braided Brake Booster Hose

its probably goodyear Power Brake Vacuum Hose goodyear part # 65108 350 psi
rated.It would be a good replacement for your brake booster hose.I tried to
get my local napa to get me some but they would only sell me 50' cause they
had to order a whole roll and didnt expext to be able to sell it(besides a
few feet to me)
