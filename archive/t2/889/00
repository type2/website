Subject: VW Type2 on XBox 360

OK.  I am not a gamer but after my wife and kids for years have been
harassing me to get a game console, I finally broke down.  My wife is
getting an Xbox 360 for her birthday this week.

Now comes the real question...  Are there any good games out there with
VWs (especially VW Type2s and Type1s)?

I thought this might be a good obsurd question to ask on a Monday.  :-)

Thank you all,

Michael Martin
