Subject: RE: [T2] Oil Analysis

Hi Volks, I have been using oil analysis for the 1776 I built since it's
inception. The procedure is to drain 4 ozs.of hot engine oil into the
supplied plastic bottle. Send it to the company and in about a week, you
will receive a report that tells the metal content of the various kinds of
metal in the oil. My 4000 mile oil report showed a little more copper than
average; however, the report credited this to the break-in of the engine.
The oil analysis has made me feel a lot more comfortable about the
functioning of my engine and confidence in the engine's durability. Well
worth the $25.00 the test costs. Ted
