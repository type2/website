This is an interesting observation, but beware of the single data point
syndrome.

Your subaru engine computer might well be adjusting the timing to match
the increased octane of the fuel, something which won't happen on an
aircooled VW without major mods.  If the knock sensor senses incipient
knock it will retard the timing to prevent it, which in turn leads to an
increase in operating temperature.

Now, this is just conjecture, but knock resistance is the only parameter
of high octane fuel that is really different.  Otherwise high and low
octane fuels are virtually identical.  There really isn't any difference
in the way the fuel burns as long as pre-ignition doesn't occur.

It's kind of a double-edged sword.  If pre-ignition occurs, temperatures
go up.  If ignition is retarded, temperatures go up.  However, if the
engine is tuned to run on low-octane fuel without pre-ignition, then there
is no advantage to using high-octane fuel.  For example, my Mexican engine
wouldn't knock if I ran it on tequila!
