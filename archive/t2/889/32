Subject: 72-79 Pick-ups?

Hello,

Many of you may not be aware, but in North America you have a better chance 
of finding a split window Single or Double Cab then finding a 72-79 SC or 
DC. The 72-79 pick-ups were never brought into North America, due to 
regulatory reasons. So where is the best place to search for one? Mexico, 
UK, etc...


Thanks
