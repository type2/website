The reason was the 25% tariff (aka "chicken tax") imposed on imported  
pickups. VW could bring them in but stopped when the big 3 acquired  
their 0-25% instant no-cost discount vs. any pickup VW could offer.  
Based on US sales, it made no sense to build a local factory and I  
guess the unibody made it difficult to skirt the rules.

Europe has the greatest selection. There are several importers who  
scour Europe for them and resell them. With the exchange rate right  
now (1.26 USD -> 1 EUR) and the cost of fuel bring a bus over by  
container is really expensive in my opinion.

Another disadvantage is the British pound which is strong and so the  
prices of vehicles are priced for export to that market which is VW  
crazy and pay a premium for rust free vehicle.
