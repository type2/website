To say the least!  Brake parts (of indeterminent origin) in their catalog
were 50% higher than the locally sourced ATE parts I just installed in my
Beetle.  And that was before shipping!

You pay a lot for those purty catalogs.  My wife gets catalogs from them
like clockwork and has never made a purchase from them.  They must have
gotten her name from registration records or something.
