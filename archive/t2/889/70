I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but your 1600 is not going to last to
long without coming up with some conversion tin.  You will burn up the motor
in short order.  Gaps in the tin around the motor= Burnt up motor.

Unfortunately, it seems to be common practice on the old busses, a newbie gets
the bus, knows that the motor is air-cooled, and thus does what you have
inherited.  The motor will not last without being sealed, period.   I
guarantee you, that besides those tins you have already mentioned, that you
are missing the tiny tins that are near the exhaust on the cylinder.

Plus, whomever the PO paid to do this work is an idiot.  If they were worth a
hoot, they would have known the above.


The only way that you will get heat in this 1600 configuration in a late bay
bus is to add a gas heater.   It is not possible to switch the fan shroud and
heat exchangers to accomplish this.

You should find a good running 2 liter with the tin, and work out a trade..Or,
pull the motor, find a pre-72 bus without a motor, and stick it in.
