Andrew,david,Jim and karl 
  thanks
   
  ok so little late getting back to this but now here i am.
  We were headed to brew bus in rosman nc and as we packed up the bus this was a issue.
  eager to go and been planned for months we were somehow going even if it was in the beetle and sleeping in a tent.
   
  I found that i had some double thick water hose here(commercial red water hose)
  i was able to clamp a piece of old brake booster hose with the wire in it in the end of the water hose and put a clamp on it and putting that onto the carb body and male connection there.
   
  the other end i had to run through the tin  and connect on the other side the other piece of brake booster hose.
  the piece i was using as a connection tube wasnt all that and by changing it i only had a old bowden tube here that i keep as a spare and connected the two now water hose and the brake booster hose together....through the tin.
   
  wallahhh i crunk her up she had now a steady idle and checked timing and was good to go....
  so prayed for the best and set out through the foggy mountains trying to find the campgrounds, was indeed a nice ride the mountains always have a spirited look to them but with the fog they have it certainly.
   
  made it there and had a decent time even though we dealt with the rain showers and Rumbles from around the mountains surrounding us and the grounds and everything was wet we did get in some tubing time down the river about four hours + coming back and kicking back tired but rested,
   
  leaving day checked oil little low but understood since we were hauling a load and came up some pretty big mountains not getting out of 2nd gear at some points taking our time feeling the trailer hold us back like a ton of bricks dragging the ground...
   
  after the hills she did fine.
  expected no less out of her on the way home.
   
  said our good byes and off again never stopping to get gas going straight home except for a small on the exit over the road back on the exit jump out and fix the pop top kinda thing. was raining badly before we left and i tried to drop it and latch it all in a down pour so its understandable  i guess LOL....
   
   
  so getting back safely no bad reports thank goodness.... get yalls replies and call around today and look for big bore hydraulic line and also 1/2" oil cooler hose that is at least 300 psi + capable....
   
  nobody has it as i figured....
   
  one guy at Napa though says that he has some 
   
  15/30 seconds ----- 1/2 inch vaccum hose
  1.32 a foot
   
  part # H 470
   
  now i told this fellow larry that i needed it for brake booster hose and he swore on this and i also explained to this fellow that  it can colapse , saying this to him i just went ahead and got all the info on the hose and figured i would throw it back to the list and see hmmmm?
   
  would what larry has be good for our vw's?
  for my 76 weber carbed bus?
   
  he did say he had the hydraulic house also but i would have to make fittings or something on the ends of this...
   
  this isnt complicated but all these parts stores around me just dont do vw's they are so rare in my area it is really sad cause makes it harder for knowledge to be abundant or even to get parts in this town.
   
  i get alot of whats and naw thats not what you need or thats not what the computer says that your vehicke calls for and so on.... so like part numbers ...
   
  i got a real run around when i replaced my main tank to gas cap hose .... no one could help at all but finally i was able to take the part number from richard atwells site and call napa and get the required or could be used hose to do the job. 
   
   
  so any help with this further would be awesome and thanks for already the info already passed forward.
   
  If what the napa guy has the house i above listed then i will go get it and use as brake booster hose but i dont want it to mess up and want it right. i do alot of traveling and brakeing and starting and stopping ....LOts~!~ and hopefully soon more and more camping...~!~
   
  one more thing what is the little black plastic piece that is right behind tin running on that side of brake booster hose? i cant find that at bus depot or in the manual?no reference or picture anyone got a name for this part or a part number ...? connects in the brake booster hose behind tin.
   
   
  peace

  The problem with 1/2" (12mm fuel vapor/smog hose is that it is not wire
reinforced to deal with the large vacuum pressure exerted by the servo when
the brakes are used and it sometimes collapes. Thick walled fuel hose means
nothing unless it is reinforced to withstand 300psi fuel pressure and then
you would not have this potential problem. Karl is right that the plastic
tube is used on Late 74-79 Type 2s (and subsequently on 80-91 Vanagons), but
it's not usually immediately available even from the local VW dealer (I know
it's not from mine two blocks away).

I have been using 1/2" Oil Cooler Hose for over 15 years now on my
Power/Servo Brake applications regardless of the year. In addition this
size is also used on Type 1 68-75 Auto-Stick Transmission Servos from the
Intake Manifold. Oil Cooler Hose is more than adequate in reinforced wall
strength that it won't collapse/implode under large vacuum pressures. Oil
Cooler Hose is a lot more easier and less expensive to use than the factory
VW Reinforced hose.

Just my 2 cents worth.
