Subject: Short underneath dash

Good Day People, 
 
I posted this few months ago John Baker Help me out, thanks John... Lost the
post to reply....... Still need more input....

Basically.. I have a short somewhere underneath the dash...when I get into
accessories I have all the following:

Front beam
Flasher
Hazard flasher
Dome lights..
 
 
When I try to start it (all the way)... nothing..just the sound of the
pump... the fuse blew, sometime the fuse don't blow, That is when, I seen
thick gray smoke coming from underneath. I figured that I would check where
the "fire" was.. could not see it in time..Could I do that on purpose to se
where it come from again..?
 
wouls it be the ingition switch?


any help would be appreciated...

NOTE this is not urgent matters..
