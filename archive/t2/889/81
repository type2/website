Subject: Re: [T2] Wire harness

Thanks for the help.  

I just spoke with Bob at Wiring Works, and he has no '72 wiring harnesses available until November.  He suggested that MAMW may have old RMMW inventory, and yes indeed, they did.  I shall have new wires to convey my electrons, and a I shall devise a new means of protecting the harness.
