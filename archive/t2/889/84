From Orginal Message:

One final question - is there only way to test the mechanical fuel pump
other then putting it on a bus and going for it?
_____________________________

I tried to test it with a modified air presure gage... Did work far as I
know. It showed the right amount of fuel.. I think it was 65psi or something
like that... I just added a rubber hose to fit the output piece and a can to
put it in...

Not sure if it a "right" way to do it though..

Cheers
