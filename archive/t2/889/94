Subject: RE:Parts engine (fuel pump test)

My father taught auto mechanics until he retired. Way back in the '70s, he
used to use a pump lobe from a Chevy mounted in a drill to check mechanical
fuel pumps. He would set the drill to stay on, then holding the pump in his
hands force the lever against the spinning lobe just enough to mimic what
was going on in the engine. It seems to me, he just put a finger over the
output hole to check for air pressure. If it could pump air, it would pump
fuel. I suppose you could do the same thing with a copper pipe cap with an
off center hole mounted to a bolt and chucked in a drill.
