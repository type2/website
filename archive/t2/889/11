Hi Darren,

I was always wondering if using some heat reflectors (something like 
http://www.novitherm.com/installation.htm) above the exhaust  would help 
reflecting the exhaust heat.

I was also curious in using some painting like this one 
(http://www.usehickson.com/BlackKnight/Roofing/RVHeatReflectorRoofCoating.shtml) 
to reflect the  heat.

What about helping the small oil cooler with a small fan ?

One thing you can also test is the Vietnamese way of cooling their 
engine, they have big water tank in the top of their root which  bring 
the water drop by drop to the engine trough a hose ..... ;-)
