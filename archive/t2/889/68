I don't have a photo, but below the cylinders there are 4 or 5 pieces of
tin.  There are two small pieces that are attached to the rear (RIR)
flange of the cylinder tin with two screws each.  The right rear lower
piece comes in different shapes to accommodate different breather and
heat riser arrangements.


There are also two large
J-shaped pieces that are attached to the front flange of the cylinder tin
with two screws each, to the oil sump with two screws, and to the heat
exchangers with two screws.  Sometimes the right side part of this is in
two parts to allow access to the thermostat.

Also in this region is the heat riser, a short piece of sheet metal tube
that goes from the rear of the #2 cylinder up through the breast plate
near the dipstick.

HTH, George
