over a number of years of testing and checking I find that I need to run
89 Octane in my 78, why ??? but on 87 it will knock on hills under load.
maybe when engine was rebuilt (it was supposed to be stock) it got a
little higher CR, maybe some carbon build up, maybe the auto tranny puts
more load???

not sure why but know for sure to put 89 in it or shudder ever time it
knocks...

YMMV
