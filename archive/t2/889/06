I've pondered the different pulley idea for quite a while.  Some say that
the pulley has a different offset on a 38A bus generator, but I have my
doubts.  My bus had a stock 38A setup with the belt perfectly aligned.  I
switched to an alternator setup, using the same pulley, and the belt was
still perfectly aligned.  I did have to swap the tin and fan hub with
Bug components.  Later I replaced the pulley with a generic
pulley (not thinking of any difference) and, lo and behold, the belt is
still perfectly aligned.  Either I'm exceedingly lucky with parts mixing
or there isn't much difference between the pulleys.

Also, the Bug pulley doesn't have that much thickness to spare.  You can't
really make one more than a few millimeters thinner on the generator
side.

Could someone please measure a 38A generator pulley and verify that it is
of a different thickness?  It might same someone some ghost-chasing!
