Subject: AIRS REQUST - Harrisburg PA Ignition Issues

Hi Volks,

Jamie Auch is stuck on Rt 15 Just North of Harrisburg PA. He's a  
stone's throw from the intersection with 850 West.

The engine burned up a set of points in the 009 distributor, and his  
replacement set have turned out to be crap. He found another set that  
looked like they would clean up OK, but when he tried to static time  
the engine using a test light the test light won't go out.

The test light is connected to the negative side of the coil, and is  
being grounded to the case. Chris Cybulski, Adam Narraway and my Dad  
and I have all thrown our best ideas at the problem but Jamie's still  
stuck.

If there's anything you can do to help, please give Jamie a call.  
This is not the time or place to bash his use of the 009, he has a  
custom 1904cc dual-carb engine that was designed to run with that  
distributor.... Up to now it' never been a problem.

Jamie's Cell # is 336-782-6009


Happy trails,
