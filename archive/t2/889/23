Subject: BussDepot ??

Hi ,
has anyone had trouble ordering from the BussDepot?
I'm trying to buy an engine from them,for my  '77 westy, I'm looking for a
complete rebuilt  2.0 L  along with the tin. I've sent them 2 e-mails in the
past week and 1/2  trying to get a price for them to ship it to B.C. But I
can't get an answer somehow.Maybe I'm sending it to the wrong e-mail address.
If they don't ship to B.C. ,that's ok. But if I know I'll phone someone else
right away to get one.
Thanks for any suggestions.
Bernie,
Fort Langley, B.C.
