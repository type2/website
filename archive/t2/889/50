One caveat on vehicles even 25 years and older.....

In California, those neat 72-79 VWs (actually 76-79 is the most
critical) will have to have all of the necessary emission controls required
to pass our infamous smog test as related to vehicle engine requirements of
the time period at a US FEDERAL level.  In otherwords, if Fuel Injection
System (75-79), EGR Valves/Filter Boxes (73-79) and Catalytic Converters
(usually 79 only) were required on Federal Models of the time period,
California will certainly require a visual & sniff inspection before
allowing it to be titled.

In otherwords, if you bring in a 76-79 VW whatever from wherever with a
1600, single carbureted engine factory installed, it won't pass the smog
requirement.  It essentially has to be the 2.0 Fuel Injected engine (in the
case of Type 2s).

There *may* be additional states that have this requirement, so check first
before you leap ;-)
