  Also, the pushrods which actuate the pump are notorious for wear.  The pump my pass the thumb test but the pushrod may be worn and the engine will not run, or will run and then QUIT running at the most inopportune time.   AMHIK.  Check the specs on the pushrod to make sure it's ok before you button it all back up.  greg
