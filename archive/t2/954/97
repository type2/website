The Vent Seal is available from a number places...

Bus Depot:

Cheeper at Wolfsburg West:

WCM has 'em too.

The Vent Assembly in good shape.  Well.....that'sa bit tougher.  I use to
collect 'em to refurbish and sell, but that was over a decade ago.

Try Chris (-at-) Busted Bus (303 545 5084)
or Derek (-at-) Wayout Salvage (479 665 4126)

Or do like Bob says, convert to the window to all glass (the right side
glass works perfect) on the left and get a seal for that.
