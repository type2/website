Ken, do you do glass work? My wife does it as well. We have a large kiln in our garage, and she makes the most gorgeous bowls, sushi dishes etc. I take my hat off to the artists out there. Her latest trick is to make clear glass bowls with beautiful rocks imbedded them on the bottom.

And glass--we have an anealing kiln made 
 specifically for glass here. It is computer controlled and it 
 "ramps" down temperature slowly over several hours.
 
 Glass would probably make a very poor thermostat I expect.
 
 Cheers,
 
 Ken
