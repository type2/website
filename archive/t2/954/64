The 77 Westie officially moves to the running list, clutch works, brakes 
work, drives and runs just fine, and I haven't even tuned it up yet.  Took a 
little while to flush the fuel system.  BTW, the gas tank strapped to the 
cement mixer trick is fantastic.  I didn't have any gravel, so I used some 
rusty old bolts, and I not only got a like new on the inside gas tank, but I 
got like new bolts as well.
