Absolutely. Every 5 firings, I heat anneal the brass I use in my target 
rifle to soften it. It work hardens due to the firings, and the annealing 
brings it back to a useable cartridge case. I suspect you are right about 
the soldering, that it will eventually give up. My next thought is epoxy 
like JB Weld, which stays flexible and can handle a LOT of pressure. The 
trick will be to get a good bite onto the brass thermo body. It will have to 
be scrupulously clean.

 Can you anneal that which has work-hardened? I suspect
 it will fail beside your solder joint - or on the next
 crease. It would be interesting to track - how many
 cycles are you willing to sit through with the hot
 water? -BaH
