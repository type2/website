Hi Paul,

I asked about the Hubcap on the Buskatier's mailing list and got the  
following reply... If it surfaces again on the Buskatier list I'll  
try to find out where it is and see if we can arrange a Type2 list  
member to get it back in motion once again.


Happy Trails,

Hey,
While you folks are out there doing your long distance race from Key  
West to
Alaska keep your eyes open for a lone bus hubcap and a suitcase full of
paraphernalia.  Does any one know what ever became of the hubcap that  
was
supposed to "tour" North America?
