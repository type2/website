I have an N.O.S. one of these retracting side steps that I brought back with
me from Germany many years ago. Very rare item, of course.  It had been a
dealer return, and on brief inspection it is missing some of the ancilliary
hardware (1, 7, 8, and 10-14 in the diagram, it appears) but is of course in
nice condition.  I'd sell it for $140 as-is if someone wants it. Email me.

I also carry repros of the later style larger non-retracting side steps, for
$129:
