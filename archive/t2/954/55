Actually,

I prefer the ignition switch in the dash.  Wasn't '68 the first year  
of the locking steering column?  I'm assuming before that the  
ignition was in the dash.

Now that I think about it, I guess I like the ignition anywhere but  
the steering column.  That would include the dash like a '68 Porsche  
912, and by the shifter like a Saab.
