If you ever try to weld cast iron, your choices (besides
silver solder for hairline fills) are to work so fast the
piece more or less never gets hot, or pre-heat the piece(s)
then weld hot then carefully manage cool-down over, say,
a couple of days.  It is for this reason that what little
of it I've done I've done in the keep-it-cold way though
that tends to be a poorer finish and is likely to have voids
(at my skill level, which is decidely mediocre).

Correct me if I am wrong -- it is hard to be real right about
something you shy away from doing...
