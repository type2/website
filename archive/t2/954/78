Michael, You never mention black smoke and you refer
to backfiring (popping) wheezing and bucking. No black
smoke and no chugging or "chug-chug-chug" which are
the first symptoms I recognize for running rich - rich
enough to stall. The black plugs are all that indicate
rich and that could be occurring seperately from the
core problem.

I don't think it is related to the AFM as the most
common symptom for worn tracks is when you drive along
a level road with little wind at a steady throttle at
normal cruising speed (what would relate to say,
60mph) and the engine just stops running with no other
indicators - it just stops powering the bus. If you
move your position on the throttle, it runs again. If
the bus slows down enough, it runs again. Not related
to your problem.

Does it rain a lot where you park your bus? Have you
checked the rubber elbow at the gas filler? Just stick
your finger in there and feel all around. Is there a
tear in the rubber elbow? Rain water has a tendency to
run in there and, water in the gas has more of you
symptoms than running rich. It doesn't however, have
the key one, that it occurs when thoroughly warmed up.

Other places to look for a problem when warmed up are
condensor and ignition coil.

You replaced the fuel pressure regulator. Remember
that at low vacuum it raises pressure and at high
vacuum it lowers it. Easy to see if it is functioning
by blocking its vacuum and see if RPMs rise.

If you ARE experiencing black smoke, then maybe it is
the wiring to the head temp sensor. On one of my
engines, the FI harness was cooked so badly that all
the wires were extremely brittle. Where I caught the
problem was at the CHT sensor - there was a wire that
was broken inside the insulation and it worked fine
until it didn't, then it didn't work until it did!
Very frustrating. Wiggle wires while it's running well
and see if you can find a spot that causes a misfire
with some repeatability.

If you want to eliminate the CHT (you already replaced
it, I know) you can pick up a 2k resistor at any
electronics store (even Radio Shack) and solder a
couple alligator clips on there and plug it in in
place of the CHT sensor. Just to be safe, get a
half-watt resistor rating although I think a quarter
watt should be fine. For that matter, At operating
tem, you could likely jump directly accross with no
resistor and see if it makes a difference. {The more
resistance, the richer it will run. An open circuit as
in a broken wire scenario is infinite resistance and
should always produce black smoke and chugging, but
not popping and wheezing. As the engine warms up, the
resistance values drop so a warmed up engine should
have much less than the 2400 ohms at 70 degrees. I ran
extra resistors on mine to enrichen it at freeway
speeds and so had variable resistors, or
potentiometers, "pots" for short. I added another 2k
(2000 ohms) for freeway driving. If I forgot to take
the extra resistors out of the circuit when I left the
freeway, my bus layed down a smoke screen you wouldn't
believe. The engine had no power and chugged like a
steam locomotive trying to start out! It never
backfired or wheezed - those are symptoms of a lack of
fuel.}

Hard to identify wires without knowing the colors!
Brown is always ground. Brown with a tracer color is
also ground, but may sometimes not be directly to
ground. Any other color should not be ground.

What year is the bus?

Where are you located? If you're within say, 50 miles
of me, I'd gladly come over with testing tools. Many
other list members will do the same if they know where
you are. The way to proceed is to state your general
area in your posting, but make next level connection
via personal e-mail and finally by phone. That way you
aren't giving your housekeys to a million strangers!

And get up off your knees, for gosh sakes!
