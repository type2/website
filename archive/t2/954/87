Subject: RE: [T2] Replacing lifters!

Todd,

The lifter that is soft is losing hydraulic fluid and is bad. The lifter
that is rock solid is good. It is good you are replacing all of them as a
set.

All of you Febi lifters need to be pumped up solid with oil before you
install them. You have to disassemble the lifter in a can or bucket of 30W
oil and reassemble them to eliminate all the air. It is time consuming, but
worth the effort. See the Bentley or the Type 2 Library for good write-ups
on both your questions.

I made a tool for the job. Take a clamp, cut the swivel foot off of it.
Smooth the clamp end with a file and clean it so there are no filings or
dirt on the clamp. Then when you reassemble, you just clamp the lifter back
in place and snap the ring back in. It makes it much easier than using a
screwdriver or a spare pushrod.

Good luck,

Jon Stiles

Hey guys,

     We'll, I'm in the middle of replacing all my lifters for my GEX rebuilt
motor (yeah, I know...) with a new set of Febis.
So far, I'm pretty sure I have now figured out that this is definately the
problem caused by the severe rattling (not a knocking).

Of the two lifters I've removed so far, one of them is VERY easy to
compress,
the OTHER one doesn't compress AT ALL... even with a pair of pliers! (don't
know how to explain that). I'm only done with my second, so we'll see. So
far,
the most difficult part has been removing the tubes.

Anyway, thought I'd post a quick question. What is the BEST way to adjust
the
valve lash?


Thanks!!!

Todd
