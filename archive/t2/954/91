Being totally new to the type one motor, I don't know what is normal. When I
first start the truck I get a puff of blue, which clears up right away.
After that white smoke until warm and then no smoke. I haven't checked the
compression but the last time it was checked very few miles ago (and four
years) it was around 150 on all cylinders.
