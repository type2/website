Subject: hose clamps on FI intake

If you hose clamp the boot to the intake stack.. and it "backfires" back
up the stack you stand the chance of hosing the air meter box.. I blew
the flap right out of one on my 76 bug... many moons ago. After that
I never used a hose clamp. This car had a habit of doing that now and then.
I never did figure out why.. but after removing the hose clamp it would
just pop the boot off but didnt harm the airbox.
