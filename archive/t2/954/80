Hi Volks,

I heard back from Al on the Buskatiers list. The hubcap is no longer  
in Columbia. Apparently it changed hands at BNNTA and was supposed to  
go to Havasu. Did anyone see it there?  If anyone knows of a Gregg  
Modul (sp?), perhaps they can drop him a line and see where it is or  
where it wound up.

Maybe someone could move this thread to TheSamba and see if there  
have been any sightings. It would be nice to get the HubCap back in  
the hands of the Type2 list again.


Happy Trails,

If it truly is there, a pickup can definitely be arranged.  I could  
bring it
to EB along the way for show and tell, then get it started to the left
