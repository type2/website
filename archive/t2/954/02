Yes Mark, that was what I did as mentioned in the first few sentences. The 
solder did work to stop the leak, but I'm just wondering about related 
stress , now that it will have to constantly contract and expand. I think 
these thermostats get work hardened after so many expansion/contractions and 
then crack. When I load match-grade ammunition, I anneal the case mouths to 
prevent cracking and make a consistent pressure build as the powder burns. I 
wonder if some propane work and consequent quenching would return these 
thermostats to a softer, less crack prone condition.
Take care,
Courtney

 So have you tested it in 90 degree water yet? Watercooled radiators
 are soldered; why shouldn't solder work on your thermostat?
