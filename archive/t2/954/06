OK, i do this (tire balancing) for part of my living (full time firefighter, 
part time mechanic, tire balancer extrodinaire)

Without having one in my posession, I am almost dead certain that the hole 
will fit one of the adapters on a computer balancer.

>That's right, both are the same bolt pattern.

the diffrence is in the size of the bolts going thru the hole.  If he 
drilled it to the larger size it would wobble or get off center for the Bug 
rim.  I'm so sure it will work that as a professional tire balancer I would 
order some for myself if I hadn't found ours this afternoon.

I have no affiliation with the adapter dude. recieve no kickbacks, or profit 
in any way from the sales of said adapters.
