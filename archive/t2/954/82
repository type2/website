Subject: Replacing lifters!

Hey guys,

     We'll, I'm in the middle of replacing all my lifters for my GEX rebuilt
motor (yeah, I know...) with a new set of Febis.
So far, I'm pretty sure I have now figured out that this is definately the
problem caused by the severe rattling (not a knocking).

Of the two lifters I've removed so far, one of them is VERY easy to compress,
the OTHER one doesn't compress AT ALL... even with a pair of pliers! (don't
know how to explain that). I'm only done with my second, so we'll see. So far,
the most difficult part has been removing the tubes.

Anyway, thought I'd post a quick question. What is the BEST way to adjust the
valve lash?


Thanks!!!

Todd
