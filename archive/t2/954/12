hello Don     The splitties had a couple of different  types of these. I have 
2 of them and they are slightly different. I plan on  putting one on my 23 
window when I get it done.  It has a petal that you  push on and the step will 
slide out by itself , you then just push it back and  it locks itself till you 
release it again  later  Mark  Dearing
