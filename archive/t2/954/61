Feelin' groovy? Perhaps it's because an Oscar-nominated movie and a far-out
TV show have taken you on a little head trip back to the flower-power era
via vintage Volkswagen buses.

In *Little Miss Sunshine*, the dysfunctional Hoover family hopped in a
yellow one for their trek to the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. And on
Wednesday's *Lost*, Hurley (Jorge Garcia) stumbled upon an old blue model
buried in the brush.

*Lost*'s transportation department picked up two VWs in Oahu, where the show
films, and fitted them with the Dharma Initiative logo.

"The VW bus seemed like the perfect fit for (Dharma's) hippie esthetic,"
co-executive producer Edward Kitsis explains.

Adds co-executive producer Adam Horowitz: "We also wanted Hurley's discovery
of it to affect him in a positive way. The VW seemed to immediately evoke
feelings of optimism, freedom and hope."

Brian O'Kelly, head of a California chapter of the Vintage Volkswagen Club
of America, says: "Everyone is nostalgic. Back then, families didn't have
DVD players and iPods. When you traveled in a bus like that, you traveled as
a family."

The yellow bus in *Little Miss Sunshine* was manufactured from 1968 through
the mid-'70s, and *Sunshine* producer Peter Saraf fell so in love with the
bus that it is now parked in his garage. "I actually bought that bus after
we wrapped," he says.

That comes as no surprise to O'Kelly, who has been watching vintage VW buses
gain popularity: "You can still get your own used bus for about a thousand
bucks and restore it yourself."
