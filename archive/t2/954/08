Subject: Fresh Air Vents

So I've got my new 78 bus (giddiness all around)!  I'm slowly making a
prioritized inventory of what to replace/fix/upgrade...whatever.  I'm stumped
on the fresh air vents.  I've found sources for the missing flycatcher but I
was trying to find parts for the vent flaps themselves.  They are pretty
rusty, one of the mounting brackets is shot and does any one know, are there
supposed to be some sort of seals on these things?  Right now when I open and
close them, they clank pretty good and that doesn't seem like they'd make a
good seal.  I looked at the schematics on Richard's website, but couldn't make
it out.

Thanks.
