Event Info:



On March 7th, 20007, beginning at 11:30 am. join us at the Wesley Bolin
Plaza near the State Capitol as we gather to celebrate great cars and enjoy
the company of our fellow hobbyists! 
We have asked Govenor Janet Napolitano to officially proclaim March 7th
Arizona Collector Car Appreciation Day to celebrate Arizona's contribution
to automotive heritage. 
The govenor and numerous state legislators have been invited to attend the
celebration and enjoy some of Arizona's most beautiful collector vehicles.
Lunch will be served and hobbyists will have the opportunity to bring the
issues that are important to them directly to their representatives in state
government. 
Hagerty is dedicated to promoting favorable pub;ic policy for the collector
vehicle hobby, and we want your legislators, the media and enthusiasts
across the country to know that you are too. 
Please visit www.hagerty.com/advocacy for updates on Arizona Collector Car
Appreciation Day. If you plan to attend, please contact Rory Carroll at
231-922-8805 or Rcarroll(-at-)hagerty.com. Thank you for your support and
commitment to the collector vehicle hobby.
