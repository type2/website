I've had grooves worn in my AFM resistor network
which resulted in poor contact at the wiper arm.
Loosening the mounting plate for the resistors,
nudging it over a bit and retightening it made the
wiper rub on a path next to the grooves.  Better
contact.

The resistor network is screen printed onto an alumina
substrate.  A pattern of gold, palladium silver,
carbon and glass pastes are screened on  and fired
in a furnace, like ceramics.

In the photos you may see the olive green rectangles.
These are the thick-film resistors with overglaze.
And the dark lines are where the resistor was trimmed
using a laser beam.

Whenever I put the lid back on the AFM, I put a small
bead of silicone sealant.  I figure it will keep
'false
air' and dirt from getting in there.   I digress...



As to the original post, it may be a bad temp sensor
on the cyl head.
