Subject: Vent Window

Uh Oh. I removed all of Pumpkin II's windows for a
paint job, and destroyed the rubber seals in the
process.

The left reat vent window (by the rear bench
seat)turned out to be pretty rusted, but I can't seem
to find either a replacement seal or a new vent
window.

Any Ideas?

TIA
