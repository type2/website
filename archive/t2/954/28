Ah, I stand corrected. I don't know much about brass. It is just the opposite with steel. And glass--we have an anealing kiln made specifically for glass here. It is computer controlled and it "ramps" down temperature slowly over several hours.

Glass would probably make a very poor thermostat I expect.

Cheers,
