So I made it home alive with my new to me 68 single cab. Very strange
experience, what with the difficulty finding 1st and 2nd, (someone put in a
weird aftermarket shifter), the front end looseness, the front brakes
pulling to one side, the lack of heat in -2 weather, and to top it off the
engine won9t idle because nothing has been done to it for four years. I went
as far as replacing fuel lines, fuel filter and oil (also not changed in 4
years), but I had a ferry to catch and the plugs and points sat in my
backpack. And the other strange phenomenon was the rear window - at night it
is reflective, and reflects what is going on out the front window. So when a
car approaches with it9s lights on, in the rearview mirror it looks like
someone is passing me at the same moment. More than once I had to stop
myself from veering away, heart in mouth.

So at the barest minimum, a tune up, brakes, and replacing that damned
shifter with the stock one needs to be done ASAP. As well as find out what
in the front end is so wobbly. Oh, yes and that damned awkward steering knob
HAS to come off.

But  few questions: what kind of seatbelts are supposed to be in this thing?
For the passenger side there are regular ordinary seatbelts, but on the
drivers side there is just a shoulder belt that almost looks like a military
thing, with a kind of hook and eye thing that I9ve never seen before.
Somebody tell me that9s not stock and there are proper seatbelts for this
truck?

Also who carries the best quality aftermarket parts for restoration? The PO
showed me a mirror he bought a couple of years ago from CiP, and the metal
was all pitted and rusted. I will also want some new tin sections for
underneath so I don9t want flimsy crap.

Thanks all. It9s good to still be alive :)
