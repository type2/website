it's how good you are with a grinder!

These are soon to be the middle seat in the Guac. Seats from a 99
Caddy STS. I've welded them together and I am in the process of
fabbing the stands.

Yes, I still suck at welding. But they're functional! This was done
with a HorribleFreight 120v flux core wire feed welder. It works
awesome, though with some nasty splatter.

And it's oooohhhh sooo fun! I love this stuff! Especially now that I
have an autodark helmet. heh
