WARNING:

Although CIP1 does SHOW 211 609 625, it clearly shows in the description
line that they say it fits Beetles, Ghias & Type 3s with no mention of Type
2.  And here's a possible reason....

The Type 1 & 3 applications actually use 113 609 625 which is smaller and
readily available from VW Dealers, many aftermarket shops, etc.  CIP1 may be
using an incorrect part number - Buyer Beware.

The 211 609 625 is a little bit larger for the larger diameter spreader
spring.  And it was NOT superseded to the 113 609 625 when it was
discontinued by VW.
