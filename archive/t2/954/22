is that legal, and if so, do you really think it would be just as safe 
as having the seat installed in the rear of the van?

I thought about this as well, because as you know, in a westy you are 
just SO far away from the back seat area. It would feel wierd to see 
your child way back there when your up front driving, especially without 
someone else back there to keep them company (save maybe for the dogs.)

A child seat installed in the rear facing front passenger location?

(going backwards) to hold the seat.  Justr as strong as any other seat and
safest option if you want to be next to your child."
