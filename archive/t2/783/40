Subject: Type 2 in France and Switzerland

My uncle and his two friends travelled there in the 60s to ski in the alps
and do the Europe thing. They had two different buses. The first one was
bought from two Schoolteachers returning home to Vancouver. I don't know
what happened to that one. The second one was a 1960 cargo van they bought
from a French Winery it had vineyards painted all over it they took it under
a bridge and brush-painted it blue to detract attention from the fuss. The
dilemma was paperwork, so one guy wrote his father with the chassis number
and asked him to register it down at the dmv. In a week Rhode Island License
plates arrived in the mail. They screwed them on and drove all over europe
for a year with no problem except once at the Morrocan border for a few
hours. They used the pedal guard compartment for their dope. I remember
visiting them in Lesin when I was 5 in 73, they were living in a hut - when
you went out you peed to the left and gathered snow for the spaghetti from
the right. One time they were in a nice chalet and had to sneak the motor
inside to do a rebuild without the landlord finding out. another time one of
them picked up Tim Leary hitchiking and brought him back to the place.
I remember going to the club vagabond for fondue in the bus sittin in the
back among the skis and boots and there were icycles on the inside by the
vents. They took it back to the states where it sat for years in a driveway
in Harmony RI with a 'broken clutch cable', we kids would play in it. I
remember coming back each year to see it. Around 1980 it was foolishly
disappeared to the junkyard. alas, alack, alamp - how did you get buses
imprinted on your brain?
