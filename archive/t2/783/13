HUH? Hhat?  I am dead flat certain that the housings, axles, bearings, and
seals are the same from '73-'79 and that the bearings, axles, and seals
are the same at least thru '83 (altho the V'gon housing is quite
different) and had always "known"  that this was true from '68-79.  If it
isn't, PLEASE someone post!

OOK!
