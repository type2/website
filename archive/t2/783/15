 are the same at least thru '83 (altho the V'gon housing is quite
 different) and had always "known"  that this was true from '68-79.  If it
 isn't, PLEASE someone post!

Housing:
Left:
211 501 253  start of 68 model year to 210 2300 000 [end of 70]
211 501 253B   211 2000 001 to 211 2300 000 [71 only]
211 501 253C   from 212 2000 001
BUT ETKA says:
211 501 253E   from 211 2000 001 til the end of 79

For the Right side, all the numbers are the same except 253 becomes 254.

Not sure what VW did to make the E replace the B and C......

Hub:
211 501 619  from 211 2000 001 [71 model year went to composite drum and hub]

Stub axle:

Outer bearing:
68 to end of 70   
211 501 283
71 up

211 501 283D see workshop manual H-100 2/1973
