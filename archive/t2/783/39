actually I think this is all correct. The two terminals 1 & 15 are the
ends of one of the coils. If you connect something to the 1 side and
have power going to the 15 term then that closes the circuit and you
should see 12v. This is how the test light works with standard points.
rotating it to it just goes out is where the "spark" will occur.

What I would do is use the small notch in the upper ring of the
distributor body to set TDC for #1. then fire it up. From here you can
time it the correct way. Also when moving between an 009 and the SVDA
that aircooled.net sells the direction the rotor points to when at
#1 tdc is 90 degrees off from each other.
