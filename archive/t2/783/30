Peter,

A picture???...please...this is interesting!

Yes, I have an input shaft that I use like that.  It was cut from a bad 
trans many many years ago, before the clutch folks included a plastic one 
with practically every clutch kit.


Maybe someone found it in the street, saw the VW symobol and thought it 
had fallen out of your bus!...LOL!

Cheers, dave

 I just had a thought - don't some people use an old input shaft as a
 clutch alignment tool?
