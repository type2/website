Subject: Re: [T2] '72 distributor in a '68

Always go by the distributor being used NOT the engine.  The
distributor out of that 72 Bay is actually for a European 1968 Only
(Except German Market) Type 2

Specifications:
0231 137 027  (VW 211 905 205 N)
Distributor, VW Type 2 1600 1968 Only (Europe except Germany)
Points:  01013
Condensor:  1237 330 119
 Note:  Superseded to 1237 330 069 (02007)(Short Wire) or 1237 330 245
(02069)(Long Wire [models w/AC])
Cap:  03001
Rotor:  04006
Vacuum Advance:  1237 121 279 (07024)
Timing Set At:  0 (Zero) degrees TDC Static or (-at-) 800-950rpm w/strobe,
w/vacuum hose disconnected and plugged.
Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum (Advance Only): 17-19deg (-at-) 1.3 In. Hg,
32-35deg (-at-) 3.2 In. Hg

Interesting note:  Even though a different Bosch/VW number than what
was used elsewhere in the world, the vacuum can and timing specs are
the same for all three markets (Europe, Germany & USA).  In addition,
the German & North American Market used the 0231 137 021 (VW 113 905
205M) distributor in 1968.

Hope this helps
