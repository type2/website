Subject: Window-unit A/C install... Anyone got pics?

I just watched a tape of the 'Motor Week' show that was rerun maybe 2 weeks 
ago. One of the segments deals with idling of large Diesel trucks while parked 
(for crew sleeping, mainly).  Their point: It is dumb to run a huge engine for 
the purpose of powering a small A/C unit.  The segment showcases a system 
available at a number of places where the truckers refuel, shower, and sleep.  
The truck is issued a filler panel specific to his passenger cab window; the 
driver then pulls into a slot, places the filler in the window, and hooks up a 
large hose, maybe 12" diameter or so.  This hose brings in cool air in summer, 
heated air in winter.  The filler panel also includes a monitor and speaker, 
allowing the trucker to watch TV programs.  I think they also said it has 
Internet hookup available!

Bottom line...... why knock yourself out making some kind of support to hold a 
window a/c unit in your passenger window?  Why not make a free-standing support 
for the a/c unit... then connect the input and output to your Microbus with 
flex hoses.  If nothing else, it could save dented bodywork and scratched 
paint.... all you need is some easy carpentry, some flex hose of suitable 
diameter, and Red Green to apply the Duct Tape ;-))

I'm in the process of designing a (removable) window-unit a/c mount
for my '79 Westy, for use while camping. My plan is to fabricate a
mounting system for the passenger-side front window, but I'm trying to
makee surre it goes in and out as easily as possible, and I don't want
to have to make any physical mods to the bus. It seems to me I've seen
a pic or two of this sort of thing over the years, have any of you
tried this?
