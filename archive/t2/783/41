Actually the listing is right; the full VW part number is actually 021 119
295 01C. The 01C suffix is simply a color code (01C denotes black). Not sure
why VW bothered to add a color suffix for this part, as to my knowledge
there were never any other color choices anyway.  (Hot pink, maybe? :-)

There is a section on deciphering VW part numbers on our Links/Resources
