I did it many years ago, took out the double.
put the tire on the front of the bus (flame war bait)
bolted solidly a seat there, don't remember where I got it, don't even
think it was a bus seat.
took a sabre saw and cut out some of the backrest down to the top of the
seat base.  didn't cut that.
smoothed the edges and put something on them and drove for many miles.

I wanted walk thru....
