Subject: Those with Kadrons ...

So here is a bit of a specific question to Kadrons.

I finally saved up my pennies and spoke to Boston Bob to get myself  
one of his wonderfull engines. Now this is going to mean going from  
my 1700cc engine to a 2L and I am definately going to have to re-jet  
my Kadrons. Getting them right the first time was definitely some  
trial and error and some pointing in the right direction from Jon at  
aircooled.net. With this soon to be mine 2L I want to get this as  
close as possible the first time round (paranoid now).

I thought I would ask some thoughts based on my altitude here in  
Calgary,  1049 meters above sea level, with OFTEN trips to 2000  
meters. I do find myself dropping down to sea level occasionally  but  
I've always had a smaller set of mains and idles with me in those  
situations (though it would be really nice to know what some of you  
sea levelers are running for jet sizes on a 2L)

I suppose it would be of a little note that it DOES get cold as (-at-)#$%  
here and I DO drive my bus year round too


So, I ask your thoughts to help me get in the ball park for jets.

Thanks !
S
