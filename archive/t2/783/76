That is an excellent Idea,, I never though about a syringe..   i use a syphon
hose and compressed air to start the siphon...

I have extracted almost a full mason jar of fluid from some boosters,,, I think
you call that a quart.... which converts to about 500cc  ml  same thing iirc.

I haven't had any problem with fluid damaging the booster,, and still wonder
what to look out for after the booster is drained.... will something in there
fail soon?  Mine hasn't in 2 years 50,000kms .......
