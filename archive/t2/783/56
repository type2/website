Subject: '72 distributor in a '68

Hello Y'all, I am trying to do a tuneup on a friends 1968 Bay. It has
what appears to be the stock crankshaft pulley, with a notch at TDC, and
a couple non-stock nicks at 12 and 15 degrees BTDC. The distributor is a
stock SVA from a 1972 Bay, # 0-231-137-027 or 211-905-205N.  Does the
later distributor determine the timing advance , or should I go with 0
degrees as is recmmended for the '68 engine?  Thanks again, Timo
