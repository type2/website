Subject: Who bought my heater a couple years ago? Large Floor Panel!

A couple years back I sold my heater setup on my Westy to someone off
this list and I have the large sheet metal protector piece that goes
under the bus that I never shipped out. We talked about it but you
weren't in a hurry. Anyway I'd love to ship it out to you now. If you
can email me then we can get it out. If anyone needs this piece (it's
that large sheet metal piece that bolts under the bus floor covering all
the heater and pipe connections, drop me a line and I'll put you on the
waiting list!
