Subject: Bus advice

Hi, gang, it's been awhile since I've posted. 
Ok, I've done it, I went and bought a dog of a bus. It's a 1974 camper bus with the pancake-style engine (1786cc?) with a dead hole. But I really love the Safari camper kit, so I'd like to keep the bus. Any recommendations on engine suppliers for this bus? As I understand it, the engine is underpowered for the bus even at its best. Is that correct? 
Any suggestions on up-grading to like a 2-liter? Am I going to pay out the nose no matter what? Any help or advice gratefully appreciated. Jason
