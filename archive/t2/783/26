Subject: Strange gift?

I thought I would save this until Friday, since it's not really a
technical discussion.

On Wednesday morning I found what appears to be a transmission input
shaft wrapped in plastic grocery bags jammed into my driver's door
handle.  I hope it was wrapped in plastic bags to avoid scratching the
paint.  I think it was in the door handle so I would notice it.

It took me a while to identify the part, as I've never seen one that
wasn't sticking out of the end of a transmission.  If I look closely
at the part of the shaft just before the clutch splines, I can see a
VW symbol and a G stamped into shaft.  I have no idea if this would
even fit the transmission in my bus (which is in fine shape anyway).

Anyone have any theories?  I can't believe that one of my neighbors
had this lying around the house, noticed I had a bus and then decided
to donate it anonymously.  Of all the VW parts you might have lying
around, why this one?  Is this the first clue in a mystery I'm
supposed to solve?  Has anyone had something like this happen to them
before?
