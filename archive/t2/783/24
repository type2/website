as I was reading this I got to thinking about what could happen to
that cap that would cause it? Are we all SURE that the cap in not
actually moving? It's been a few years since I pulled one, but doesn't
the spring pressure always push against the cap, causing a person who
has not removed one to just assume that since it still has tension on
the cover it must not be unscrewing? They are fine thread IIRC so it
takes quite a few turns to make a difference.
