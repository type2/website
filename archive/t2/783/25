Agreed. The shift linkage from shift knob to trans is something I have done
battle with on every bus I've owned from 65-79.  Unlike engine diagnosis, I
find this to be one area to just throw (good) parts at untill you nail it
down.  New couplers, new bushings (that fit), lots of grease, just go over
everything as a system.  Patience under the bus.

Richard A. has described the shift linkage here as a "house of cards".  I
totally agree.  When I got my '65, which has a metal coupler with a set screw
holding the front and rear shift rods together, there was no screw, and only
light California rust holding it together.  I shifted like that for two months
before I found it.  Then I took the entire system out of the bus, cleaned,
painted somethings, greased everthing, all new wear parts.  What a pleasure
afterwards.
