Subject: Window-unit A/C install... Anyone got pics?

I'm in the process of designing a (removable) window-unit a/c mount
for my '79 Westy, for use while camping. My plan is to fabricate a
mounting system for the passenger-side front window, but I'm trying to
makee surre it goes in and out as easily as possible, and I don't want
to have to make any physical mods to the bus. It seems to me I've seen
a pic or two of this sort of thing over the years, have any of you
tried this? Has anyone posted a procedure or materials list anywhere?
I'm planning on documenting the "build up" and install, so at the very
least the info will be available in the future. Any help or advice
would be much appreciated. Thanks-
