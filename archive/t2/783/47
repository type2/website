I to was also going to use the POR-15, but the multi stages and the
seemingly finicky application and topcoating thing was a bit of a turn off,
not to mention the greater expense.  Rust Bullet comes highly regarded on
the Samba site.

I still plan on the POR -15 treatment of my gas tank as per Richard Atwell.

I have been getting great results cleaning carpets, and vinyl  and plastic
parts with a product called Pink Solution.  It is enviromentally friendly,
non-toxic and cheap.
