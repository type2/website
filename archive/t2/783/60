Subject: Stage 2 - how big is a westy ?

Quick question if anyone has a tape measure handy could they give me 
overall dimensions of a '71 westy (I guess '68-73) will do and be sure 
to include the door mirrors in the width . although I guess we'll fold 
them in for shipping.

The shipping company need to know the dimensions.

'71 westy (not quite mine yet, but getting closer)
