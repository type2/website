just a thought, having not seen what they stuck in your door handle, but
the tranny pump shaft in an auto tranny has a bad habit of falling out.
there is the possibility that someone was towing an auto tranny bus
without it's engine and this fell out on the street (heck it could be the
one I lost during a tow a few years back)  someone saw it and said "Hey he
has a bus maybe he can use it."

the auto tranny pump shaft is about as big around as a little finger and
maybe a foot and a half long....FWIW
