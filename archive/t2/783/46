Stephan,

I've done it in a similar way a loooong time ago.

Please believe me, it is so much easier with a jack, that is is almost 
worth any amount of time, begging, borrowing or money to have a jack.

Plus!  When you get ready to put it back in, you can almost  roll it right 
in.

*please* get a jack!

The case *is* strong enough, but please consider a jack!

Pull the engine ,then place the 4x4's on each side under the engine as you 
let it down toward the floor.


Cheers, dave

 After years of avoidance, my first engine pull is going to happen. It is 
 a well covered topic, but I have what I think is a new question. Do I 
 have to support the engine under the sump plate as all the books say, or 
 can I put supports on  either side of it (they would press against the 
ribbed part of the crackcase)? To be more precise, I have cut a 
 foundation block so that two foot long pieces of 2 inch square timber
