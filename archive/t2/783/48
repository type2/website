Not quite the same, but similiar,

Several months ago, I opened my front door and there
was a book about 5 x 6".

An old Jokeswagon book, 1966; very nice shaped.  A
collection of cartoons about VW's; very funny !

I've asked all my neighbors, none claim to have
dropped it off; to this day the mystery remains !

Somewhere I here something about bus karma...
