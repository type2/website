M10 x 1.0, extra fine 10mm, sort of hard to find but a good Ace hardware
and I mean good or machine supply place should have it.  In a pinch you
can "make" a tap to chase the threads or even cut new out of an old worn
out T4 valve adjusting screw.  Just grind/file 2 or 3 cutting edges into the
screw and grind the end to a bit of a taper.  I used one of these for some
time till I finally broke down and bought one.
