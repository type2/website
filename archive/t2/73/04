Steve,

I hate to say it<grin> but you need to get out more<double grin>.

This is one of those deals where you need to be in a club and do a group
buy! 

I have found that my local "ace" hardware has lots of metric fasteners and
stainless as well.  When I need some fast I just go and check their
bins...they are yellow "specialty fasteners" bins.  Not cheap, but easy
and immediate.  This is from a guy that *used* to consider a slow Sunday
morning just wandering in the hardware store a real treat.  No time for
that these days though.

Cheers, dave
