As usual my plug for gear2000 brought to you by type2.com.

Seems like maybe I need a gear2002 update at this point, anyway
it can answer all your questions, get the ratios out of Bentley.  If you
got excel on the computer should start right up off the www page.
Put the 4.57 box ratios in the top the 4.86 ratios on the bottom and
compare tire sizes at will, etc.
