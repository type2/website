Hi Mike,

How does a 205 series tire wind up a smaller diameter than a 185?  As I
understand it, the 3-digit number is the tire width in millimeters (1 inch =
25.4 mm), and the second number is the sidewall height expressed as a
percentage of the tire width. I may be wrong in this interpretation though,
and would welcome an expert correction if that's the case.

With this formula a 205/70 tire has a sidewall height of 143.5mm, whereas a
185/75 tire has a sidewall height of only 138.75mm.

I ran a set of 14" 185/60 series sport tires from a BMW on my 1973 Westy for
a few months.  I needed tires and they were free to a good home, and it was
a while before I had the funds for something more reasonable.  They put the
bus about an inch closer to the ground and improved acceleration immensely;
but the top speed and fuel consumption took a major hit. I got rid of them
as soon as I could afford a half-decent set of 185/75's.

Right now my westy is sitting on its rims in my garage, when the weather
warms up I'll be slipping on a set of C-rated 185/75 Kumho's so I can ride
nice and smooth down to EveryBus this spring. Last year's under-rated 185/75
Dayton's have now gone to my Dad's Ford Tempo where they (and he) are much
happier.

If you need a smaller diameter tire you'd be better with a 185 in a lesser
sidewall rating, like a 70 or a 65, but you'll probably have a very
difficult time finding one with the right load rating.

Happy trails,
