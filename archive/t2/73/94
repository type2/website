The number is only a guideline to a range of dimensions.  If a tire 
falls into the range, it gets that size.  That's why dimensions tend to 
vary between brands.

I think that the 185/75s will be too small, and the C range is not high 
enough in this size.  Check the sidewall and make sure that the Maximum 
Load is 1540 pounds or greater.

You want a straight 185 section tire, which has an 82 aspect ratio.
