Subject: 6 rib trans into 74 bus.

Hi All. I have the chance to buy a 2l fi engine and 6 rib trans to replace
the 1800 carbed engine and auto trans I currently have in my 74 bus. What I
need to know is how much drama it is going to be to make this combo fit with
the 6 rib trans? I remember seeing some where that a 3 or 5 rib trannies are
the only ones that will fit into this model. Why is this? is it something to
do with the trans to chassis mount? if so is it possible to fabricate an
adaptor? I am not worried about setting up a shifter or the FI etc at this
stage, just whether I can bolt this setup in.
I Have searched the archives and gone through the library drive train
section to no avail. any info would be much appreciated
Regards to all.
Paul.
