Subject: interior floor project - carpet

Hi everyone
I'm in the process of replacing the rear carpet and plywood floor
in my bus and I hope you guys/gals could give me some ideas.
I really would like to add some sort of sound proofing
material with the carpet. I've considered adding carpet padding
but i'm worried about it absorbing any water, drinks that are
spilled on it.  I do not want to use any roofing material etc...

So here is a few ideas i've come up with for layering
1) metal floor / plywood / padding / 6 mil plastic sheeting / carpet
2) metal floor / plywood / padding / carpet
3) the last option would be either of the two with a way to pull
the carpet back to clean or remove any trapped water.


I'd really like to just secure the carpet and leave it.
But with the option to be able to reomve the carpet to clean
would be helpful. I don't know how i'd go about that though.
Using glue or staples to secure the carpet would be permanent.
Any ideas how how I could secure the carpet, not permanently?

-details-
The carpet i've bought is indoor outdoor carpet from home depot. Fairly thin
The padding i have is just plain carpet padding
plywood is 1/4" (two layers, first layer used to level the floor out)


Any thoughts or experience on this would be very helpful to me

thanks a bunch, and have a good rest of the holiday
