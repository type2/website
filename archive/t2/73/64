Hello Mike,
and Hello Overpowered Itch,

I'm doing this battery size fit on both of my buses;
with NewBus even being rigged for dual battery where both batteries are 
size 24 deep cycle.
Size 24 selections work awesome for camping power and plenty enuff left 
over to start on the coldest of the next mornings...... How do I know? heh heh.

Play a few tuneys, Read all night,
Camp in the booneys, Seep real tight......Vrrooom,,,,,,,, Start good the 
next morn.

BTW
Mary Beth and I were speaking of you just the other evening.
Take a moment to p-mail us, and let us know how you are doing.
So, is Dave doing VW wrench gyrations in your garage?
