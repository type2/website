Well, it turns out that the DMV was *closed* yesterday so I looks like I
won't be able to register my car...


.... until tomorrow!



IT PASSED! IT PASSED! IT PASSED! IT PASSED! IT PASSED! IT PASSED! IT

WOO HOOO!!!!!!!!!!

Yup, it passed smog.  They toyed with it a little and now it's running a
perfect 14:1 air/fuel ratio at 15 and 25 mph so that makes me pretty
darn happy :)

This has been the most annoying struggle, and has lasted, I dunno, 5
months now.  Aw man.. whew!  Thanks to everyone that helped me out with
this all.  I really, really appreciate it!

Now it's on to rebuilding the original engine that I blew, and then
rebuilding another after that :)

thanks again!!
Mike
