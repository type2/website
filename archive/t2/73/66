It will work fine.  If you're going that route, why not get the group 27 
(105 amp/hr if I know the brand you're talking about) instead?  Only a 
couple of bucks more, will fit in the space and better dollar-per-amp/hr 
average.  Cranking amps will be no problem for either battery.  If you have 
a membership to Costco, they have Motocraft RV/Marine "deep cycle" in group 
27 for about $50.    That is a good battery that I have personal experience 
with.  Others that are also made by Johnson Controls (Autozone's brand, 
Interstate) should have a good service life also.
