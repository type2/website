Hi Paul,
        Never counted the ribs and can't directly answer your question. However the 002 transaxle  used through 75 and the 091
transaxle used 76  through 79  have compatible bell housings that will mate up to the type 4 engine.  They are also all nose
shifters. The 091 (80-83.5)  and the 091-1 (83.5 -91) have compatible bell housings but are  side shifters. It is also possible to
swap bell housings between models.
    I use a South African 5 speed bell housing to adapt the 091 transaxle on my 78 westy to an i5 audi engine.

Darrell
