Subject: Yeehah!  Sliding Door Is Tuned Up!

Hiya All,

First off, thanks to all who responded to my earlier post about my balky 
sliding door.  It just wouldn't "seat" itself into position so that I could 
lock its latch with the handle.  I got comments and suggestions from David, 
Tom, Chuck, and Courtney.  Thanks folks - you are what makes this List so 
great.

The response I received from Andrew however, got me to thinking.  He 
mentioned that he had just installed new seals in his bus.  So had I.  And 
that started me wondering...........  I got my wife to sit in the second seat 
and try closing the door.  I figured this would be a true test 
because.........well, because she throws like a girl.  If she could get the 
door to completely close, anybody could.  And from the inside too!

All I did before I gave her the green light was to open the passenger side 
front door.  She closed and locked the slider shut with ease!  The air 
pressure in the durn bus was keeping the slider from closing (You were 
dead-on right Joey!) all along!  So, just to see how much air pressure was 
generated in this operation, I closed the front door after I had rolled down 
the window.  I had her close the slider again while I stood in front of the 
open window.  The blast of air blew my toupee into the next door neighbor's 
yard!  Well, it would have if I'd had a rug.  I knew VWs were airtight, but 
this is ridiculous.

My advice?  Clean and lube the latches and hinges, adjust the door, and roll 
down a window.  Wooohooo!
