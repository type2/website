I'm drawing a diagram for some additional circuits for my 74 bus and I'm
wondering if anyone can tell me what the amp draw is on the blower fan
mounted overhead in the engine compartment. Also, if anyone happens to know,
the amp draw for one of those bilge fans used in the heating system?

Thanks,
Dave
