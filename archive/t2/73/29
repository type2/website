Subject: Re: [T2] Calipers - Rebuild or Replace?



> I'm thinking about rebuilding the calipers on my 71 bus, but the 
Bentley manual makes it seem fairly complicated.  Is this something 
that can be easily done without all the special tools, or am I better 
off just purchasing remanufactured ones?  I have decent mechanical 
skills, if that makes a difference.

I've done it and it isn't particularly difficult.  _Don't_ separate the 
caliper halves from each other!  You don't have to do this to rebuild 
and if you leave the seals undisturbed you won't have to replace them.

I used a small pair of vise-grips "backwards" to grip the piston from 
the inside.  I made a tool from PVC pipe to use with a C-clamp to seat 
the dust seals.  Other than the dust seals being a bit hard to seat, it 
was not difficult.  Be sure to replace the brake hoses at the same time!

After you get the pistons out, inspect the cylinders.  If you find 
corrosion pitting, it's time for new calipers, so don't waste your 
effort in putting in new seals just to have them leak.
