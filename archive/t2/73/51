I've got one of these.  The directions specify how much air circulation you need, and show it being used in a tent.  Check the archives for LONG discussions about 
death by O2 deprivation in a bus, but I think with the windows cracked it would keep you warm.  I prefer to have a toasty warm bed (plenty of down) and use the 
heater only when getting ready for bed or getting up.  Otherwise I usually have a fire going outside.

And on cold, rainy days I don't camp, having already got my merit badge in that particular activity. ;-)
