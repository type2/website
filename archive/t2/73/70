Subject: Sliding Door Tune-up

Greetings All,

I'm trying to get my sliding door (70 Bus) to function as it should.  Or at 
least the way I think it should.  My take on this is that the sliding door, 
when moved forward, should "pocket" itself in the door space so that it can 
be latched in place.  Am I right so far?
I've had to push the rear end of the door into the door space so that I could 
latch it in place.  Of course this makes closing the slider from the inside 
of the bus impossible.
So..............  I took out the center rear sliding hinge link and cleaned 
and rebuilt that thing.  As a matter of fact everything at the rear of the 
door is cleaned and lubed.  The door has been adjusted ala Bentley.  The fit 
is perfecto!
However the door still doesn't want to move into a latching position.  It 
will do so if I really reef on the door and send it forward with a slam.  
But, it seems to me, that I should get the "closing action" with a lot less 
force.  
Any kind souls out there have any helpful hints for me?

As always, TIA

Mike
