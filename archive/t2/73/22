Subject: Calipers - Rebuild or Replace?

I'm thinking about rebuilding the calipers on my 71 bus, but the Bentley =
manual makes it seem fairly complicated.  Is this something that can be =
easily done without all the special tools, or am I better off just =
purchasing remanufactured ones?  I have decent mechanical skills, if =
that makes a difference.
