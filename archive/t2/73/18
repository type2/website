Subject: 1974 Westy main cabin lamp

First I'd like to thank all who helped me with my search for the fuse for the "house loads".  It was located on the positive lead to the AUX batt.  To my surprise the reefer and DiHydrogen Oxide pump work, however, the fluorescent lamp is still inop.  I got 12.37vdc on the leads and replaced the bulb but still no worky.  I checked for continuity on the circuit board components and found all ok except for a blue, round component I think may be a capacitor.  Does anyone know for sure? Or does anyone know where one may purchase,barter, or otherwise procure the entire assembly?
                             Thanks in advance,
                              Denny Weaver
