Clark, Eddie:
Maybe this is a little late. Clark is darn near right on the factory (Bentley)
method of removing the hub. The factory tool is a big "C" shaped washer that fits
between the hub and the seal and transmits the pressure around the nose of the
case equally.
I don't have one of these tools, just use 3 big flat washers and bear down equally
till it pops off. I usually put the center bolt back on loosely to catch it. It
really comes off with a bang. I'd definitely use all three bolts.
