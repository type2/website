   Mine was a tad small also. Took a dremmel tool with
a grind bit and enlarged it with no damage to the
original covering material. Soooo you realy cant tell
and I suppose if you wanted to reinstall an original
radio you do a little shimming? But why? The original
is great for a show bus but... If you actually use
your bus why not have good tunes?
  There is a vinyl cover over some thin foam then the
metal. You can enlarge the hole without butchering the
dash vinyl.
  JMHO
