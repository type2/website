Hi,

I see what you mean about how it would be nice to be able to pull up the 
carpet.  I would try using velcro.  You can get it on large spools from 
craft supply stores or a fabric land.  I am not sure what the best way to 
fasten the velcro to the carpet would be but I think you would get the 
results you are looking for.  I am not sure how your van is set up but on 
mine there isn't allot of clearance between the bottom of the fridge door 
and the carpet, just something to think about when you are layering.... I 
think if you went plywood-velcro-shag carpeting you would probably get nice 
results.
