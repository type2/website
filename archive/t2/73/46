After days of thinking about just this question, I ended up cutting mine. I 
cut several vertical slits into the bottom bit of metal (using the blade of 
a hack saw, without the handle bit), and folded them back with a pair of 
needle-nose pliers. I cut myself quite a bit.

When I bought my bus, though, the original radio was in the dash and beneath 
the glove box were several drilled holes which had held some kind of 
jury-rigged box in which a nice cd player had been installed. (Old owner 
took the cd player with him.) My dad had done the same thing in our old 
Buick when I was little, but I never liked how it looked, so I gave in and 
hacked up the dash a little. I decided I'd rather have a good-looking 
(though not 100% stock) dash, than a big, ugly dangling thing.

Another thing I've seen (in a Bel Air) was a radio mounted in the glove box. 
You lose some storage space, but that worked nicely, and let you keep the 
stock radio in. (One thing you could do is run your nice radio to new 
speakers, and keep the original working on the middle dash speaker.)
