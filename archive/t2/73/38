Hi all
I'm trying to add a CD/Radio unit into my 79 Westy

Chuck,
Not sure of the dash similarities to my '70, but I had a CD/Radio installed
and there was MINOR trimming of the cutout.  I think it was about 1/8"
total (or 1/16" on each side) leaving about half of the hard plastic
before the padding.  The other options are the glove box or a custom
under dash/center console enclosure.  The stock cutout was the best for
me.
