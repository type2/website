The two side catches are mounted on the grey metal bracket that the seat =
itself screws to.  They are spring loaded so that they latch in place =
and are stamped metal.  They're about 4 inches long and from the end are =
U shaped (see ascii art). =20

They sort of look like this from the side.  The break in the =3D is =
where it engages with the pin.

From the end they are U Shaped, with the open end facing down.

These pieces are mentioned in the 70 Westy manual =

Hal,
I'm unclear as to what you are referring to when you say "side" latches.

As for the 2 latches that secures the rear seat down when in the normal=20

I have a couple of these catches that screw into the underside of the =
seat.

I picked them up at a "you pull" junkyard this past Summer, but have =
never=20
got around to installing in Casper, as I really feel no urgency to do =
same.

Looks to me like these "hold down the seat" latches don't do too much.

If you feel as though you really need them, I could photo and send you a =

jpg picture so you could see what you really are not missing.
