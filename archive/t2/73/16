Subject: The Very Best to All--

It has been a most difficult year for many of us--Yet we still have a lot to
be thankful for--No doubt a Special Thanks to all, who stood up for America
in so many ways--

In our own dimension of VW Busland, we thank all of those who are
responsible for having this list in which to communicate-- It has not been
easy for them--And I know all of the listees appreciate their work--

Perhaps we can show our appreciation of what this Year In America means to
us--By reaching out, to touch, or help, our Fellow Americans with an act of
kindness?
Hopefully, uj
