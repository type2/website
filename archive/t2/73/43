Dear John.

In Great Britain, there are or at least were, combination nuts cum cinched 
washers, available in stainless steel, in most common metric sizes. I intend 
to find out more about them for my own purposes sometime. I don't know 
whether they made any with serrated washers!

VW Heritage Centre advertised stainless steel exhaust manifold studs a few 
years ago.

Regards.
