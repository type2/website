Temperature is the other killer for "stainless" steels.  But I've been using
304 to assemble exhausts with flanged serrated nuts for some time and
they discolor but hold up well.  Got to use antiseize profusely though as
most 300 series are "soft" and tend to gall easily.  Still nice to be able to
have the fasteners still recognizeable 5 WV winters on from their install.
5/16 of course as I'm not keen to pay for metric stainless for all the joints
on Vanagon exhausts.  I would love to find some stainless 8mm serrated
flanged nuts for the headers though.
