Check your dwell.  This could be caused by point gap closing up due to 
rubbing block wear.  After this happened to me after many trouble-free 
miles. I now check my point dwell every oil change.  It's a matter of 
simply switching the meter to a different setting as I am already 
checking idle speed and timing with the same hookup.
