Bill,

I'm still fighting that one in my 78 that sat for 8 years.

Yes, the black goo is gasoline turned to "varnish".  It can get hard as
rock(or harder) and the only thing I found that would dissolve it was
lacquer thinner(very slowly).  Lacquer thinner is probably bad for every
other part in your fuel system and highly explosive.

I dissasembled/replaced *everything* that was touched by it, except the
gas tank.....wishing I had done it also now, but it required removing the
engine and I wasn't ready for that yet.

Cheers, dave
