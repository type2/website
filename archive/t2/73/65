Some deep cycle batteries are rated for starting service, and a VW 
isn't exactly a heavy load for a battery.  However, the economics of 
deep cycle batteries are not good.  They cost a lot money and have very 
little warranty.  When I was running a "camper" battery I put a group 
24 starting battery in there and it worked fine.  They usually lasted 
about 3 years in this service, but new batteries cost about $25 after 
the 6-year warranty pro-rate.  Real deep-cycle batteries didn't last 
any longer, but were out of their 12-month warranty by the time they 
died.  $25 for 3 years versus $125 for 3 years was pretty easy to 
figure out!
