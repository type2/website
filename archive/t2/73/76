Subject: Tire sizing to gear down tall tranny for 75?

I'm still vacillating whether to put a 77 tranny (all I have/can afford)
in a 75 bus with stock engine (1800cc?).... any tire sizing wizzes know
whether using a 205 tire in the back (lower diameter than 185) would be
worth it to help lower the taller than stock gears??
