=====================>
Hal,
I'm unclear as to what you are referring to when you say "side" latches.

As for the 2 latches that secures the rear seat down when in the normal 
passenger rear acceptance sitting in the seat position,
I have a couple of these catches that screw into the underside of the seat.

I picked them up at a "you pull" junkyard this past Summer, but have never 
got around to installing in Casper, as I really feel no urgency to do same.

Looks to me like these "hold down the seat" latches don't do too much.

If you feel as though you really need them, I could photo and send you a 
jpg picture so you could see what you really are not missing.
