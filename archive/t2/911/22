Hiya John,

Well, this is just another shot in the dark, but it produces the exact 
symptoms you describe.  Are you absolutely sure that the electromatic cutoff valve 
is getting juice from the coil?  If it is not, the engine will start and run 
fine but will not idle - at all!  Without the ECV hooked up the engine will die 
as you coast to a stop.

I'm assuming here that since you changed out carbs that the connection to the 
ECV was made, so could it somehow be possible that juice is not (for some 
reason) flowing through that line to the ECV?  Or that the ECV is somehow NOT 
grounded out?

Like I said, just a shot in the dark.
