Subject: Canuck Block Heater

I picked up a type 1 block heater a few years ago for my 60 - I'm not sure 
that it works better than the hot air popcorn popper but it does work.

I have a couple of pics of it here:

You'll notice that on column 1 the block heater is the 9th pic down and on 
column 2 it is the 7th pic down - the rest of the pics were taken 1) at my 
mechanics shop in Lansdowne ON, 2) at an air cooled VW shop in Fredricton 
NB, and 3) a wrecking yard in Picton ON with a bunch of barndoor buses.
