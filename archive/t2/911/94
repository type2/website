Thanks for all the replies...Got plenty of old batteries to practice
with...;-)

BTW, my buddy bought an 18V Craftsman from Sears a while ago and
when the "same" kit went on sale, he bought another...Wrong! Same
looking kit, but the factory in Taiwan musta been changed 'cause the
gun looks the same but the batteries aren't interchangeable...Grrr...;-(
