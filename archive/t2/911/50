I did all the hoses last summer except this hose.  I'm not sure how I
missed it but I did.  I agree with you, though.  I actually plan to
replace all the hoses again in the spring but, I've been looking for
the absolute best hose I can find before starting.  I also have some
other stuff that I want to replace first.

Take care,
