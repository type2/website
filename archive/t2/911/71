Condensor (capacitors) should have infinite resistance. However, they may
show some residual resistance/votlage until they are fully discharged. If it
had zero resistance your bus would not start at all since it would shorten
the points to ground and possibly fry you coil in the process if you leave
the ignition on for too long.

 The condenser shows very close to ZERO resistance, though, I'm not sure
what it should be.
