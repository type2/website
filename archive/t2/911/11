Hmmm, that's a thought.  How would I check for a vacuum leak at the head?  I
figured a compression test would indicate a leak there.

Also the idea about the fuel tank venting is worth looking at, because I know
the cap isn't vented.

Thanks for the quick responses!

Something else to try is raise the idle enough to get it to actually
run, then pull one plug wire at a time and see if any of them don't
effect the rpm? Did you double check you don't have a vacuum leak at the
head?
