mine has  about 30,000 on it but I am having a intermittent loss of power
problem  that is driving me nuts,  has anyone heard of a Pertronix that

don't  work nothing in between.   now as soon as I can find that .009  I
know is in the garage I think I will do a entire dizzy swap to see if  that
has an effect....



hey Bob  I had one that acted up like that. I was thinking that the  bus was 
vapor locking and it turns out it was the pertronix  later   Mark Dearing
