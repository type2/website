Subject: Vacuum leak check

I replaced the accelerator cable in my 77 FI Westy this passed
weekend.  It ran better than normal which I'm sure was some sort of
anomoly (not that it doesn't normally run pretty well).  However, it
smells to be running rich and I am having to massage it to get it
going out of a dead stop.  Under load, at higher RPM's is seems to be
running pretty well though maybe not a smooth as normal.  I have a
hunch that I either knocked something loose to bump a hose that was
ready to go any way.  So, the question is:  How do I perform the
compressed air vacuum leak check?  I have a compressor and I'm just a
bit concerned that I might damage something if I just start blowing
the blow gun into the plenum.

Thanks in advanced,
Ken
