Subject: UPDATE: Re: Vacuum leak check

I found a link from Richard Atwell's site that suggested 3PSI.  I
cranked my compressor back to 3PSI as accurately as possible.  I don't
find any leaks but I can hear air passing constantly.  However, I
don't see any bubbles from the soapy water test and I don't feel any
air unless I disconnect a hose.  Should the throttle body and AFM be
air tight?  I suspect not but, at 3PSI, I'm not sure that I'm going to
produce enough pressure to create bubbles if the air is passing freely
back through the Air Flow Meter.  I could block off the inlet of the
air filter assembly but, I'm not sure whether that would create an air
tight setting.  I suppose I will try it.

Thanks, again, in advance,
Ken
