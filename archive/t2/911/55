Subject: Fwd: RE: 34PICT03 accelerator pump question

Tom: The fact that the inside of the accelerator pump mechanism is 
wet with fuel leads me to believe that the passageway from the float 
bowl to the pump diaphragm is clear.  Would you agree?

After I posted,  I tried to blow air into the other little hole in 
the pump mechanism - which I take to be the fuel outlet - and no air 
comes out of the pump injector tube. So I think I have localized my 
blockage in this passageway. Unfortunately, no amount of blowing or 
sucking has relieved the block.
