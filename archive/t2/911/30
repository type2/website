	In a forerunner of what may turn out to be a sustained 
campaign, I mention one use of inlet manifold vacuum guages  - 
preferably on the dash.
	A good one will show shudders in the needle at or near idle 
caused by a vacuum leak  -  within a certain range away from the 
nozzle to the guage.  If you have seen little or no shudder on that 
needle in normal idle, and a bad vibe develops correlated with 
increased difficulty idling, that is good evidence of a vac leak.
	Then actuate one of the ingenious/dangerous methods of 
locating vac leaks  ...
