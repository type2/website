Subject: UPDATE: Re: Vacuum leak check

Well, Tom Young made a suggestion (offline) that I followed and I was
able to locate 2 leaks.  I happened to have some hunks of hose that
allowed me to fix the leaks but, that just changed the symptoms.

I now have very poor idle until the engine is warm but, it seems that
I MAY have slightly more power.  I tried adjusting the idle air
mixture screw but that really didn't make any appreciable difference.

Any further suggestions will be greatly appreciated.  I'd going to the
FLAPS to pick up new points/condens0r.  The condenser shows very close
to ZERO resistance, though, I'm not sure what it should be.  I've had
too many problems with points/condensor to skip this exercise.

Once again, thanks,
Ken
