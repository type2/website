Good question.  They knew what I was using it for but, I just called
them to confirm.  Its good to 700PSI.  The shop calls it "European"
hose, I think, because it 7mm I.D. and braided.  If I have to replace
this new hose down the road, so be it.  I recently noticed that the
existing hose is shot at the fuel rail (right above the heat
exchanger).  I gotta get that fixed!

I've had your same thought for a while.  I replaced the points on my
old Triumph GT6 with a pertronix and never had any problems with it (
I wish I still had that car).  The kids are going back to school so,
right now,  I can only afford to replace points and condenser but not
an electronic ignition.  Maybe after I get the heat straightened out
for winter time.

Thanks,
