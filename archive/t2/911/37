The most impressive thing about it was that the bus ran amazing.
Started easy, and power was outrageously awesome.
How many busses in the states have a block heater?

Yep - until you've experienced 40 below - you have no idea how cold that is 
- you cannot not describe to someone what 40 below is like.

I drove my 60 around Winnipeg a few times when it was 20 below - I'd use a 
hot air popcorn popper under the engine to heat the oil up enough so the bus 
would start - but then - when you live on the prairies - minus 20 is a nice 
winter day.
