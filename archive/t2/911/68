Subject: Re: [T2] Camp Trailer

Don asked: How is the interior? (No pics.) How does it tow?

The interior is what you would expect for a 40 yo camper that used to
be well taken care of, but then left in the yard for 8 years...

I'll have more pics of the interior as i get in there to start the
retrofit.

as for the Towing, the PO followed me around for a few mins while i
"test towed" it, and he said that he was having trouble keeping up
with me :D ... It's really  firm while being towed with no sway and
no rocking.  The title says it weighs 3000lbs but I think it's closer
to 1800 or so.

The best part is that I only paid $400 for it, with new tires.

Im pretty happy about it.  Hope to have it done for the John Brown
Busses event.

Dave
