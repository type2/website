"I know Radio Shack used to sell a very nice micro torch."   Fuggedaboudit.  If it doesn't pertain to a cell phone, PDA, or  some radio controlled toy, they won't have it.  They've gotten  away from their core competencies and core customers...people who  actually work on electronic stuff for themselves.  Oh for the days  of Lafayette Electronics and other stores they ran out of  business.  I'm waiting for somebody to step up to the plate and  fill the void.  Partsexpress.com and other online places are the  only thing I know of.  But if you gotta have it now, you're  screwed.  Cheers...KR
