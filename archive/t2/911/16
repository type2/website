Subject: UPDATE: Re: Vacuum leak check

Doesn't look like my response to Mike got through to the list:

I've used this technique in the past and I just hate it.  It scares
the crap out of me.  My good looks are fading but, that's still almost
all I have going for me.  haha! That's why I'm trying to get the
pressure test well in control, I figure it should be more reliable
also.

Thanks again,
Ken
