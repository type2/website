mine has about 30,000 on it but I am having a intermittent loss of power
problem that is driving me nuts,  has anyone heard of a Pertronix that
acted up intermittently??  I've always heard they either work or they
don't work nothing in between.   now as soon as I can find that .009 I
know is in the garage I think I will do a entire dizzy swap to see if that
has an effect....
