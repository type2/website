Subject: Camp Trailer

I finally found a camp trailer for behind the bus.

Its a 1966 Schiebout Little Gem #7590.  I bought it from the original
owner on Wednesday, and now im going to start the rebuild.

It's in great shape outside, and the interior is fair.  It needs some
work, and major updating but really, not bad at all.

I've never heard of this trailer, and I cant find any information on
it on the web, so if anyone has anything about it, I'd love to hear
it.
