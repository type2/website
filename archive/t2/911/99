There's a serious jump in power, but you'll still be doing the flashers
thing sometimes. If you have the dosh, a Raby engine would be a better way
to go. Even if you just buy a kit and build it yourself.

The hill climbing east out of Vail in the Rockies is an adventure in 2nd
gear even for my 78. The 1700's revability (new word?) might actually help
there. My 2.0's power drops off considerably after 4000 rpms. But the 1700
in my 73 was happy running at 5000 and still pushing. But the rest of the
time the 2.0 is awesome.
