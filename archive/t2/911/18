Subject: PopTop PullDown Strap

On my 76 Westy, the OEM strap (aft of the poptop lock-down pin) is broken 
near its driverside fastening. The broken element is the foot-long steel 
band that extends between the mounting bolts and is covered by the black 
rubber cushioning tube. The pulldown looks like a streamlined suitcase handle.

For 30 years, I used this strap to pull the poptop down the last few 
inches, which allowed the locking pin to slam forward into its receiver.

Where can get a new/used unbroken strap? Obvious generic answers are: 
Salvage yards, swap meets, other listmembers.

Without the strap, I had to devise a way to push the poptop down those last 
few inches.  This posting will document the new closure method, and will 
ask list members to suggest alternative methods of accomplishing final closure.

I asked my SO to climb up on the top of the vehicle and sit on the front 
edge of the pop top.

Worked great.

SO suggests replacing strap.
