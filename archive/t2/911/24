  Greetings,

  A colleague of mine is looking for some engine / transmission technical
  and/or dimensional drawings for type 1 or 2 air cooled vw engines.  Any
  idea where these might be available in hard copy or AutoCad or
  Solidworks or other common format.

  Specifically manufacturing and assembly drawing including mounting hole
  sizes, bolt hole circles and other information that would be required to
  design components to mate to the engine and/or transmission for use in
  new experimental aircraft.

  Best regards,
