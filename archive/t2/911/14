Hey Ken,
Here's Jason's reply to another email that can help you find leaks:

Standard disclaimers about using flammable liquids in am engine bay 
apply here but.....With the engine at as low of an idle as it can run 
(not below standard idle speed) you take some starter fluid and spray 
shots at all joints (manifold end to heat, center section to manifold, 
etc) If the engine speed increases, the it appears you have a vacuum 
leak (the starter fluid richens the mixture). Some people use WD-40, but 
for whatever reason I never had much luck with it. Either way it works 
very well, just keep in mind that you ARE spraying a very flammable 
fluid on a hot engine.
