Heat is BAD for batteries.  I believe you can buy the tabbed versions in 
bulk, online from some vendors.

OK, any of you 'lectrical types know how to "affix" metal tabs
to rechargeable batteries? My portable drill/driver needs new
battery packs and it irks me to be charged over half the cost
of the kit for one battery pack...I unscrewed the pack and it's
just 1.5V nicad batteries in series, BUT with tabs to connect
'em...I've got access to plenty of new Panasonics cheep but
no way to easily/safely connect 'em...Any "conductive" glue
or micro spot welders... ?-)
TIA
