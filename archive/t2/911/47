You did get high-pressure fuel injection hose, right?

Also, you might want to look into compufire or pertronix as a points 
replacement.  I've been running compufire for 40,000 miles now and it's 
one of the best investments I've ever made.  Timing is rock solid and 
has never needed adjustment.  Just a thought....
