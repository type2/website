Subject: RE: [T2] Idle problem - update

Just called the mechanic to pass on the ideas you guys have mentioned, and I
was surprised (glad?) to hear he's already done a smoke test on it, noting no
leaks.  That makes it a little more weird, I guess, but he's leaning towards a
fuel delivery problem at this point and his next step will be to disconnect
the lines and do a volume test.

So maybe there's something to that idea of the tank venting...  Unfortunately,
he's not going to get back to it until Friday, so I'll have to sit on my hands
at least until then.  This is killing me...  I want to drive it!!!

Later,

John
