Good morning everyone,

We're in the final stages of packing up the vans for departure to the "Buses
Nowhere Near The Arch #21" event today.  Our personal supplies and all of the
event gear are loaded and the buses are tuned and eagar to go.

We can't believe our luck again!  The holiday weekend weather forecast is
fantastic, again!  For the second year in a row, the daytime high temps
throughout the weekend are forecast to only hit the LOW 80's!!!  I can hardly
believe that I can leave the window A/C unit at home and enjoy just the
weather au natural!  And nightime lows will be in the mid 60's (perfect
camping/sleeping/campfire weather).  No rain or showers forcast until Tuesday
of next week.  Man did we get lucky!

So if you've been riding the fence on this one, worried about "global warming"
and heat or humidity, scramble out to the garage and pack up the VW with your
camping gear and point the nose towards Mark Twain Lake in northeast Missouri
for a long weekend full of Volkswagens and family camping fun.  Check out
http://www.bnnta.com for more info on all the activities and directions.

The first VWs to arrive are already there with several more arriving today,
and then the bulk flowing in on Friday.  One VW buddy even flew in from
Australia and is borrowing a Transporter to attend, so you have no excuse!  We
hope to see many of you very soon around the campfires, and we hope that
whether you'll be joining us or not for this literally "cool" VW event, that
you have a safe and fun Labor Day weekend wherever you are!
