Subject: FWD fr. Germany: AC query; jalousy comment

I met a nice Westy owner while in Germany; finally got together by
email, and he had a query I can't answer because I don't have AC, and it
seems not to have been an option there?  I'm sure some listees with AC
can reply-
     Note also the comment that there were (stock) covers to the edges
of the jalousies so you don't get scratched bumping into them?

<<Hi Michael,

same situation to me, I was searching for your e-mail address too. I
remember our conversation and thought about a few things you said. I?ve
got
one information for you with the sidewindow. The german version has
aluminum
covers around the edges of the three parts of the window because they
were
to sharp. I?ve read in an article of Bus-club-newspaper that the
american
buses had airconditioning, how did that work, where were all the parts
stored?
