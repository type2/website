Subject: ok, yet another question...thermostat

Ok, yet another question.... sorry, I can't think to ask all of
them at once....

77 Westy, original engine: I was able to see my thermostat very
clearly because the lower cooling tin was missing on the right
side of the engine. Does the thermostat contract as it warms up,
pulling on the cable and opening the flaps? Or does it contract
as it cools, closing the flaps. I can't picture how the system
works on the pancake engine and haven't yet installed a working
version on my upright engine to know from experience. It would
make engineering sense to design it so that if the wire breaks,
it would fail in the flaps-open position so as not to burn up the
motor, but maybe those clever Germans knew more than I can
see.....  Also, the thermostat seemed like a little torn on the
bellows. Is it a sealed device or can it operate properly like
this?

BTW, thanks to all for your informative answers to my endless
questions! You folks are pretty quick to answer and no one has
gotten fed up and said "RTFM!!" It's on order....  ;^)
