Subject: Main Harness - how difficult to replace

While I have my 71 bus apart for the engine rebuild, rust repair, paint,
etc, is it a good idea to replace the main wiring harness. I have a brand
new one on hand and there are some cuts and splices throughout the
electrical circuitry. 
I guess the real question is how difficult is it to replace the main
harness?
