===========================>
I was sort of expecting this question.

These are small plastic "caps" used to slip on the end of electrical or 
pneumatic instruments to keep debris from entering them during shipment or use.

They are used on tubing runs to serve as a seal under vacuum or very low 
pressure applications.

They are also used to cap off vacuum lines, unused carburetor connections, 
etc. in automobiles.

JC Whitney part # 12AU9031B
$4.49 for a set 50 in various sizes

They always seem to find unusual uses from myself.
