the pulley nut takes a fair amount of torque (46 ft-lb?)  Make sure that
the screwdriver is firmly between the pulley slot and the boss on the
generator.  You might try having one person hold the screwdriver and the
other work with the wrench.  Use a long handle and consider what will
happen if the nut lets go suddenly!
