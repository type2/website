Hiya Robert,

I'd agree with Theodore concerning the taking of "before" pictures and 
cozying up with a COLOR Bentley (the newer editions are all in B&W) wiring 
diagram (or hit vintagebus.com).  But I'd also suggest that you find a a 
pretty much stocked-out 71 in your area.  Then take pictures of that set-up.  
Having a "model" to go by is simply invaluable when you are contemplating a 
job this intricate and you are, basically, starting from scratch.
