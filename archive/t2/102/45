William,

If you laid the crank out as shown in the book and then put your rods on
with the markings shown by the book, you are ok....

The big thing is that you got the cam and crank gear markings(the 3
dots) lined up properly before you buttoned up the block....sounds like
you did ok on that though.

The only thing that would make your engine run backwards would be the
wrong cam.

You probably have one(or more) of 4 things wrong.

Valve adjustment, spark plug firing order, ,distibutor out 180
degrees, points adjustment.


Remember the 4 cycles?  suck, squeeze, ingite, exhale.

Find top dead center by having your son rotate the engine while you watch
the valves on number 1 cylinder and then compare everything from there.
Remember the cycles!

Then compare where the rotor is with the pictures in the book.

Good luck, dave
