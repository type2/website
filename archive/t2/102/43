Subject: Stupid mistake?

I'm new here, but me and my son are redoing a 1970 bus.

Here is my problem. After re-building the engine and putting it in the bus 
I started to troubleshoot it as to why it backfired and would not run.

When I took out a spark plug and disconnected the coil I noticed that when 
the starter turned the engine over there was no pressure coming out of the 
spark plug hole.  In fact I could detect a suction!!!!!!!!!!!!!

When I had my son to manually turn the crank counter-clockwise (opposite of 
what the starter does right?) I then could detect some pressure coming out 
of the spark plug hole.

I can remember that I aligned the two dots on one gear with the one dot on 
the other gear when I mated the camshaft with the crankshaft.

When I laid the rods and crank into the case did I orient the rods to be at 
bottom dead center instead of top dead center?

I think this means I am going to have to pull the engine, crack the case, 
and reset the crank and rods?  Right?

Any suggestions?

My son said we should get a starter that goes counterclockwise, but then 
the fan would not cool the jugs!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!!!?

Oh well, this project is more therapy and fun, so I don't mind the time and 
cost too much.

After you finish laughing, any guidance would be appreciated.
