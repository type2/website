Subject: Trade parts for child's cot

As EveryBus 2002 approaches it occurs to me that I have not a cot for my tot.

I need a child's cot for our 68 bus/Adventurewagon. I will take any 
1968 to 1979 Westfalia child's cot that mounts over the front seats - 
straight poles, good canvas and the brackets to mount it. In trade I 
have to offer a 1968 to 1970 Westy front window curtain in decent 
shape and a really nice cover for a 1968 to 1972 Westy camp stool.
