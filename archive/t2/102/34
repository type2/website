I have found this system to work the best for irregular cover's----

High tack the gasket to the cover--then mount the cover---works every
time---

Later,

[T2] Leaking Valve Cover 
My right valve cover leaks.(78' type IV 2.0) New gaskets, still leaks.
Cover looks straight. I tried putting the bail in a vise and bending the
ends to a tighter curve. Now the bail fits a lot tighter but the sucker
still leaks. Not a lot just enough to piss me off and stink up my heat a
little. Im thinking its time for bolt on valve covers, but before I
spend the dough on that I thought I would ask you folks.
