Thanks for the help guys.
David, I'm already using a similar method to the one
you suggested & have found it useful.
It is a definite pain in the rear end though......I
was proud of the fact that I could chart the fuel
economy of the Millie(our Microbus) through the
mileage she did on each tank & now, because of this,
she's making my wife paranoid again.
Unfortunately, Millie did an engine in June last year
and after a 7 week wait and susequent replacement of
the fuel pump & starter motor, my wife over-reacts
JUST a little when a thing like the fuel guage plays
up.
It also doesn't help that Daisy, the camper we used to
own, did a major fuse which wiped out the fuel guage &
indicators while we were on holidays.
My wife loves our buses but they scare her when they
don't run perfectly.....not a good approach when you
own cars that are approaching 30 years old :-)
Anyhow, thanks once again for the advice.
I'll keep you posted about the outcome.
:-)
Cheers
