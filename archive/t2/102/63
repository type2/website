Thanks for the help everyone...considering my need to get the generator 
out...I decided to just cut the Belt....and i will take the Generator down to 
a shop and use a torque wrench of somekind...however...I am missing something 
with respect to removing the Generator....I have removed the four corner 
lugs, removed the strap that holds the Generator to the Stand...it slides 
back towards me(the rear of the vehicle) but it doesn't want to come 
out....What am I missing....Thanks to everyone who has responded....
