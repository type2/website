Subject: Testing 71' Gas Sending Unit (Cylinder Type)

List,

Having had checked the T2 Library, list archives, and several google
searches, I come seeking unfound information.  What is the proper test
procedure for pre 72' fuel sending units?  I just pulled the tank out of my
71' Bay and am trying to determine weather the misreading of the fuel level
is the fault of the sending unit or the gauge itself.  I have read that the
Bentley Manual may have the info I seek, but amazon.com is taking their
sweet time delivering.
Any information anyone can give me about testing either the sending unit or
the gauge itself would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!
