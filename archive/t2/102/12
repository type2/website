Subject: Re: [T2] Main Harness - how difficult to replace


When you say main wiring harness just how MAIN do you mean? If you are
speaking of everything that hooks to the fusebox and goes back to the motor
then you are in for a big job. The big question is if the existing wiring
is brittle, or has really been Frankensteined...

While I have my 71 bus apart for the engine rebuild, rust repair, paint,
etc, is it a good idea to replace the main wiring harness. I have a brand
new one on hand and there are some cuts and splices throughout the
electrical circuitry.
I guess the real question is how difficult is it to replace the main
harness?
