I use a set of ramps to pull my engine. It gives me tons of room to pull 
my engine .  I have a cart I put the engine on and when I am ready to 
lift the motor into place I slid the jack  under  the cart. I then lift 
engine and cart with no problem. If your bus is not running jack up one 
side of the bus and slide the ramp under the tire and then do the other 
side the same way. I may have a picture of my bus up on the ramps in the 
garage. Let  me look around and I'll post  you a link.
