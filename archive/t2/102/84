refill your tank at *every* even hundred miles. that should always leave you
with a little, though not much, leway in case you forget. I also carry a
little extra with me for those times when I forget to look at the milage I
am at. Doesn't happen often, but when it does I am glad I have some spare
gas with me.

Best part? its a very cheap solution.
