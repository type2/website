While I fond the PB Blaster stuff to be pretty good, I have found Kroil
to be of superior quality, and will break frozen nuts and bolts
faster----real good for breaking frozen engines loose----

Later,

Although I don't have much experience with VWs (yet) I have had a few
run ins with rusty bolts/nuts. 
When working on my other son's Subarus we found that the best thing to
use on rusted bolts/nuts was PB Blaster. I swear by the stuff. 
I went to the web and copied down their web site. The parts stores in KY
stock it never found it in MI, MS, or FL.
