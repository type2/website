I would agree and add that you may have installed the distributor drive
gear improperly. The other way tou can find TDC for number 1 is to
carefully rotate the crank while peering into the spark plug hole with a
light a watch for the piston top to appear. You can use a long small
screwdriver and watch it come to its highest point and then start to drop,
but be careful not to get it jammed. Once you have definatively located TDC
for No.1 then set the distributor and drive gear if necessary. Then adjust
the valves on no.1, then rotate the crank 180 degrees and do number 2, 180
degrees no3... etc. Relax, read the book. Don't split the case until you
are sure what it is inside that is not right. Most likely you did all of
that part correctly. It is pretty hard to get that part wrong.

William,

If you laid the crank out as shown in the book and then put your rods on
with the markings shown by the book, you are ok....

The big thing is that you got the cam and crank gear markings(the 3
dots) lined up properly before you buttoned up the block....sounds like
you did ok on that though.

The only thing that would make your engine run backwards would be the
wrong cam.

You probably have one(or more) of 4 things wrong.

Valve adjustment, spark plug firing order, ,distibutor out 180
degrees, points adjustment.


Remember the 4 cycles?  suck, squeeze, ingite, exhale.

Find top dead center by having your son rotate the engine while you watch
the valves on number 1 cylinder and then compare everything from there.
Remember the cycles!

Then compare where the rotor is with the pictures in the book.

Good luck, dave
