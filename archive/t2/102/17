Subject: RE: [T2] Main Harness - how difficult to replace


If you have to take out the dash and are really getting into this project I
guess you may as well bite the bullet and replace the harness. I would try
and do it piece by piece. Only disconnect what you are ready to reconnect.
Kind of like doing plug wires on a V12 Jag... Take a lot of pictures before
you start so you will have some reference, and get really friendly with
your Bentley wiring schemes. Good Luck

Yeah, that's the one. Where it enters the engine compartment some brilliant
PO had cut the wires. The bus was not running when I got it so I have no
idea of the condition of much of the wiring. I did pick up a brand new
wiring harness for $50 though. I have the engine out now and the dash has
to
come out too for some rust repair under and behind the windscreen. I
figured
that if I am ever going to do it this might be the time.
