Alex,
    It's hard to know how serious those flakes in the screen are without
knowing
how long it's been since the screen was last cleaned.  I'd say clean it up,
drive the
bus and then make sure and check the screen again in a predetermined amount
of miles.
Then make your decisions based on that second, or maybe even a third or
fourth, screen inspection.
   As for the sound, it's hard to give advice without hearing it.  In our
old 77 the
rivets that hold the cam gear to the cam shaft failed at 132,000 miles.
That did make a noise for
a while before the actual failure.
