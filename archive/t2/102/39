Sorry about the long lines.
I've switched to 30 character
auto-wrap and plain text, not
HTML; hope that looks better.

Now then, the sound.....

My point of reference is a
wrist pin bearing from my '63
that ticked away merrily for
almost a year before one day
turning to that "emergency"
sound that you can feel
through the shifter. This is
not like that yet. It's more
like a knocking that I can
actually hear better while
driving than with my head in
the engine compartment. I
think it is louder while the
engine is under load and tends
to quiet down as the engine
revs up. I don't know what RPM
that would be, around 22-25 in
2nd gear I suppose. It is also
much more noticeable when the
engine is still warming up,
although it never disappears
when warmup is complete. I
know it's impossible for
anyone to know exactly what I
mean, but is that a little
more clear about the noise?
Any further thoughts?

.  small bits of metal in the
screen may not mean much as
the engine is
always wearing away little
bits (that's why they
eventially need
rebuilding)

.  you keep talking about a
"sound" but you don't describe
it....lot of
sounds are harmless, some are
"shut the engine off NOW"
critical.
