Subject: SW Gas Instant  Heaters

Anyone have any experience with Stewart Warners "Instant Heater" in their bus.  I have seen a few for sale but can't seem to find near as much info on these as on Eberspachers.  Anyone have details or stories to share about using the Instant Heater in their 12 Volt bus?  What was the heater most commonly use in 71 Westy's?  I thought it was the BN4, so I bought one.  But after looking at the spot to left of the engine compartment where it should go, there does not appear to be enough room to mount a BN4 here because of the spare tire well inside the back compartment protrudes down into this space.  Can anyone enlighten me??
