Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel sensor accessability

Andrew,
I also live about 12 miles from town, and I have the same model fuel guage:
reads well when tank is full but after 30 miles it reads empty. I am waiting
to fix it until I have to remove the engine anyway. In the mean time, I have
a post-it note on the dash on which I write down the mileage for the next
fill-up. To be on the safe side, I fill after 150 miles (250km?) even though
I get more miles than that out of a tank of gas. Just yesterday I filled up
after pushing the mileage limits a bit. The book says that the tank holds
14.8 gallons but the fuel pump registered 14.9! I guess I cut that one a
little close.

Anyway, just set yourself a reasonable mileage range between fill-ups and
fix the sender when you have the engine out for other work.
