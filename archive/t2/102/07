Subject: Re: [T2] oil breather hose diameter?


My local FLAPS has the correct braided hose but in a number of diameters,
from the e-mails I have been getting I am thinking it is 19mm ID. If 3/4"
fits well then 19mm should be dead on. Thanks to all..

Again, be sure about these replacement hoses. I can't say for sure,
but a hose built to carry water and antifreeze, might not be good in
an oily situation. My guess would be the maker isn't gonna overbuild
a hose for more than its intended use.
