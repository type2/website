Methinks the best thing here is clean, clean, clean.  The least bit of
grime on either surface OR the gasket will foul it up.  I run a nice
clean rag over the gasket, too, right before I put it in the cover.  The
little clips on the cover will hold it in place while you get it on.

I don't use adhesives, 'cuz I hate to clean it up later, no problem.
