more convienent for you, FWIW I have mine set at 78

do you have hyd lifters (78+) this could be a collapsed lifter not common
but I've had it happen and it sounds about the same as you describe, very
easy and inexpensive repair.

hmmmm.
.  does it sound louder when turning?
.  can you detect the area of the engine where it is coming from?
.  get someone to drive the van while you have your head stuck through the
hatch over the engine BE CAREFULL,  see if you can track down a location,
don't be shocked at how loud the engine is when that hatch is open.
.  does the noise stay in time with the engine RPM, or road speed??
.  is the noise louder in any particular gear, or neutral?
