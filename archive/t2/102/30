Subject: Don't forget to 'chock' wheels

Hi,

While we're talking about safety, don't forget to chock your wheels. You 
want to prevent the vehicle from rolling. Jack stands don't help if the 
vehicle can roll off of them.

There was a good story on the vintage list about someone being under the 
bus, and a friend pushing on the motor, and the bus rolling off the jack 
stands. Chocking the wheels would have helped here.

Another good tip is to lay your wheels under your bus if you have to 
take them off. This may not save your life, but at least you won't be a 
pancake.

Thanks,
Conrad
