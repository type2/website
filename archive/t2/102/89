Subject: cylinder head temp sender location

Volks,

Anyhow...  I am writing to Al Brase about valve seats and I said (as I
usually do) that temp was the most important factor in dropping seats.  A
corollary to this is that measuring and keeping cylinder head temps down
is a critical thing to do.  As I was writing to him, it occurred to me
that the air injection ports on the 1700 heads might be an ideal location
for a cylinder head temp sender.  Has anyone tried this?  I have only
owned 2L engines and have no experience with the 1700 engines or heads,
but if you could find the proper sender, those ports look like they reach
way down toward the cumbustion chambers.  Is this true?
