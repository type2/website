Try using some leverage. Use a piece of heavy pipe slid over the end of
your breaker bar. Watch those knuckles though...

Hello Everyone--

I am in the process of replacing my intake manifold on a 1600 dp and I need

to remove the Generator. However...I cannot loosen the Pulley nut...I am
putting the screwdriver in the slot...and turning the wrench
counterclockwise...but it will not budge...tried soaking in WD40 but
nothing....Just looking for some ideas...I have thought about cutting the
the
belt...pulling the Generator...taking the Generator to a shop and having
them
use an impact wrench on it? Good idea or no? Thanks everyone...
