Subject: RE: [T2] Main Harness - how difficult to replace

Yeah, that's the one. Where it enters the engine compartment some brilliant
PO had cut the wires. The bus was not running when I got it so I have no
idea of the condition of much of the wiring. I did pick up a brand new
wiring harness for $50 though. I have the engine out now and the dash has to
come out too for some rust repair under and behind the windscreen. I figured
that if I am ever going to do it this might be the time.
