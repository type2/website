Subject: Best rust buster I have used is PB Blaster

Although I don't have much experience with VWs (yet) I have had a few run 
ins with rusty bolts/nuts.

When working on my other son's Subarus we found that the best thing to use 
on rusted bolts/nuts was PB Blaster. I swear by the stuff.

I went to the web and copied down their web site. The parts stores in KY 
stock it never found it in MI, MS, or FL.
