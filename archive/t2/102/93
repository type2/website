Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel sensor accessability

I have my tank out at the moment and I think I mentioned the removal of the
trannsmission bolts and rear engine mounts allows you to drob the engine 2
or 3 inches without unhooking it.
I watched my fatherinlaw do the job without doing this and swore i would
rather drop the motor.
If it was a really mint bus I wouldn't cut the rear deck, if it was a bit
beat already I would (and have)
The late style sender seems to fail frequently enough that VW should have
added an access panel.
The earlier ones up to mid 73 I think worked better. Perhaps this is when VW
caught up with the other manufacturers and discavered "designed
obsolescence". Anyway...........................blabla
Good Luck
Brian
