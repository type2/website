Subject: [T2] Gas tank venting


I have a 72 with 1800/FI from a 75.
I recently replaced fuel pump.
This fixed my power loss at high rpm but I have had a sneaking suspicion
that there was a more basic reason for the old fuel pump failing.
When I put the  new pump in and fired it up it was doing the same thing the
old one was so I pulled all my lines and made sure they were clear, also
drained tank.
I put lines back on and voila, new pump sounds and acts new until today(2
weeks after job) when my &^%$#$%$(-at-) problem returned. This is my suspicion.
When I put the 75 fuel tank in , the filler tube vent on the 72 had no place
to hook up so I mistakenly assumed it would be OK to plug it with silicone,
to keep spillage from flowing into tank cavity on hard left turns.
When I checked the silicone a few weeks later I saw that it was swelling out
of the tube and ready to fall into the tank.I removed it as best I could and
asked around for a good product to plug this and was told Sealall would work
so I used it with apparent success. Now that my tank is exibiting symptoms
of having a chunky in it that intermittenty  obstructs my inlet, I looked at
my vent and found no Sealall on it but more silicone sticking out.
I think the remaining silicone forced my Sealall "plug" out into filler
tube.
Needless to say I am in process of removing tank for inspection and cleaning
.
My question is: Can anyone suggest an acceptable way to plug this vent?
I thought I would try a dust plug glued in but I wonder about the vaccuum
effect of the fuel level dropping  pulling the plug out and putting back
where I started.
Exasperating!!!!!!
Thank you in advance

As an afterthought, it occured to me someone mentioned pulling the tank with
the engine in, but lowered from tranny carrier. Any thoughts on
dis/advantages of this??
