Hello Guys  To find TDC rotate the engine in the way it turns and watch the 
number 1 intake , when it goes in and comes back up keep turning till the 
pulley mark comes up on the split in the case. Just checking the piston could 
put you on number 1 or 3 not TDC .   Later Mark Dearing Salem Import Service
