Subject: Fuel sensor accessability

Hi guys, 
The fuel guage on my 77 9-seater Microbus is pretty
unreliable.
When you fill up the tank it's fine & reads well down
to about half way.
Then the gremlin gets in the works and it goes on and
off like a yo-yo!
I took it to the auto-electricians yesterday and they
said they think it's the sender after examining the
guage.
Problem is, apparently the only way to reach the
sensor is either to cut through the floor or to remove
the engine, and to be honest, I'd rather avoid both
methods if at all possible.
I have nowhere to lay under the car at home & so I
really can't do the work myself.
Will the engine have to be removed to get at it or is
there a tricky way to do it without such a major
manouvre?
If not, should I just wait until I get the clutch
replaced(probably later this year) & have it repaired
then?
The problem about the fuel guage is that I live in the
country 20kms(12 miles) outside of town & each run in
& out uses a visible amount of fuel........I really
can't afford to not know how much is there.
Any clue would be a help.....
:-)
