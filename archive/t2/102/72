Was hunting around internet ages ago & came across a 
site where someone got an early syncro, stripped it
of all body, got a split window bus & stripped it and
put the split body on the syncro running gear. 

Really impressive at the end, looked neat. Not sure if
to believe everything you read on the internet, but if
you keep searching you might come across it. For the
life of me I can't remember the link, but I'll have a 
good look at home tonight. I know I would have started 
from google to find it though...

Anyway, might be another way of achieving the result 
you want
