'63 went south, there was metal everywhere inside the case. After putting t=

(dang I wish folks would TURN ON their word wrap it is very hard to answer
an e-mail when it is all one loooooonnnnnnnng line)

but if I can remember what you said.

=2E  small bits of metal in the screen may not mean much as the engine is
always wearing away little bits (that's why they eventially need
rebuilding)

=2E  you keep talking about a "sound" but you don't describe it....lot of
sounds are harmless, some are "shut the engine off NOW" critical.
