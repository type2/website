Matty, some day the '77 is going that way.  It will be a royal PITA
requiring a custom made tranny (but I got that worked out actually)
as using a Vanagon 091/1 pinion in a 091 housing with a custom
nosecone should provide a fairly easy way to get power take off.
Or sever chopping the rear beam to use a Vanagon 094/4WD.  I'm pretty
sure the front diff will work out alright behind the front beam, and that
making spindles for the front to keep the torsion leaf front axle will
be possible.  FWIW I rolled on the ground at the Wolfsburg museum
taking digital pics of what I guess is the last factory '78? prototype for
about 15 minutes to get an exact idea how they did it.  It is a monster
of a 4wd beast though, not viscous coupled, gigantic front diff housing,
halfshafts all use real universals not CV's and are slip joint splined
shafts to allow massive suspension travel and a significant lift, rolls
on 15 or 16" tires I believe, drum brakes all round.  The thing must
have been a formidable monster offroad, much more capable than
a vanagon excepting maybe the Euro 16" models.  Anyway no riot
from me, but it will be a long hard trip whenever I undertake it and I'll
guestimate about $10,000-$15,000 of todays money to do it right.
When I'm again gainfully employed for a few years again though it
will happen, it will be air cooled, it will go anywhere.

FWIW you can find early syncro's going $1500-$2000 now days if
you look so might as well just drive one of them.
