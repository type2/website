Come to think of it, when I removed the previous engine, I didn't =
actually
jack the bus up, I just lowered the motor and (after pulling the single =
carb off)
pushed the bus out of the shop (I may have had to lift a little to clear =
the intake,
I can't remember...)  =20

For installation, I thought I'd jack the bus up a little to give me some =
more room to work. =20
I wasn't sure if the bus needed to be jacked up evenly from a center =
point.  From the
responses I'm getting, it sounds like I should jack up 1 side, insert =
the jack-stand and
then do the other side.

Thanks,

Rob
