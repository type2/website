The small blue wire connects to the connector you describe there should be
anothe rsimilar guaged blue wire for it to connect to.  This wire runs
eventually to the idiot light for your charging system on the dash.

If it's the wire I'm thinking about, it actually goes to the starter.
The other wire w/ the plug sounds correct about going to the reg.

If no one else knows exactly what this goes to, I can check my bus
(79) later and try and see where it goes on mine.
