<echelon-> hello
<echelon-> notice you scanned my host
<echelon-> any reason
<neelder> just bored.
<echelon-> and tried to connect to a bot
<neelder> really?
<echelon-> yet this channel is passworded
<echelon-> so spit it out
<echelon-> why you really here
<echelon-> you obviously got the password somehow
<neelder> easy password to hack.
π neelder doesnt rememebr trying to connect to a bot, though.
<echelon-> really don't say
<echelon-> keen ttyp3 Aug 1 00:32 (216.160.69.153)
<neelder> ....?
<neelder> what is that?
<echelon-> thats a print out of a who command
<echelon-> now why not just speak and tell me you got this out of 
eggdrop.conf
<echelon-> why beat around the bush
<neelder> huh?
π neelder is logged into a shell box...lots of users.
<echelon-> FreeBSD genesis.digital-galaxy.net
<echelon-> you attempted to telnet into a bot on that system
<echelon-> you user on there is keen
<echelon-> you read it from eggdrop.conf
<echelon-> under /usr/games/.titanium
<echelon-> plus you are a admin of that
<neelder> umm?
<echelon-> uid=1000(keen) gid=1000(keen) groups=1000(keen) 0(wheel)
<echelon-> you are in the wheel group
<echelon-> which means you have access to root account
<neelder> ...and you have a point?
<echelon-> yes
<echelon-> why you spying on my ?
<echelon-> when you can just come to the conslusion that the system I'm on 
was hacked
<echelon-> when if you would have come to the point I would have told you 
that I have not
           harmed the system at all
<neelder> uh huh.
<echelon-> all I have done is placed a eggdrop in there for this channel
<neelder> why?
<echelon-> cause I'm building a small botnet to host for my art bell 
channel
<neelder> a what to do what for what
<neelder> ?
<echelon-> explain
<echelon-> The bot I have placed on you system is harmless
<echelon-> it protects my channel
<echelon-> thats all
<echelon-> keeps it alive
<neelder> just like all the others?
<echelon-> perhaps I can be a asset towards your system
<echelon-> yes
<echelon-> I have extensive knowledge in security
<neelder> indeed.
<echelon-> I suggest that you kill telnet access and replace it with SSH1
<echelon-> no need for telnet other then as a backup to SSH1 which then 
should be only allows
           via assigned ips
<echelon-> check the history logs and you will see that I've cause no harm 
to the system
<echelon-> I've only modified the account games inorder to gain access to
           /usr/games/.titanium
<neelder> indeed.
<echelon-> you are the owner correct?
<neelder> of what?
<echelon-> genesis.digital-galaxy.net
<echelon-> the box you are logged into
<neelder> ? not at all.
<neelder> I'm not even logged in.

<neelder> keen is a popular name.
<neelder> see /whois keen
<neelder> see also Commander Keen
<echelon-> you know you system flapping.oc12.net
<neelder> of course. i have a shell account there.
<echelon-> it's hackable
<neelder> indeed?
<echelon-> cute
<echelon-> you realize I am totally aware of you staling for time
<echelon-> and that craig is also a admin
<neelder> in what way do you think its hackable?
<neelder> why in the world would i be stalling for time??!!
<echelon-> look I already know you ready the eggdrop.conf file and found 
the password for
           this channel
<neelder> no, i didnt. but whats your point?
<echelon-> My point
<echelon-> #1 this password is not easy to hack
<echelon-> #2 Why lye
<neelder> it's not? three characters, all normal characters, one lower two 
upper.
<neelder> thats a pretty simple thing.
<neelder> and, i've not lied at all.
π neelder has no reason to lie.
<echelon-> yes but the combination isn't east
<echelon-> easy*
<echelon-> you where on the system
<echelon-> funny
<echelon-> well craig just messaged me
<neelder> so?
<echelon-> saying my account on Uniserve is terminated soon
<echelon-> YEAH big loss
<neelder> i see.
<neelder> what is uniserve, anyway?
<neelder> and why would your account be terminated?

<echelon-> titan09 bad bot
<neelder> ?
<echelon-> well anyways explain something
<neelder> sure.
<echelon-> you managed to enter this channel via the key
<echelon-> but what made you think it to be idc?
<neelder> nothing. random tries.
<neelder> its a pretty standard cross and down combo.
<echelon-> well yes and no
<echelon-> the up and down case in irc passes doesn't matter
<neelder> ...which means it'd have been even easier.
<echelon-> yes
<echelon-> well anyways I know how you got the pass so lets just not even 
go further on that
           one
<echelon-> and 2nd
<echelon-> what your syn scan show
<neelder> huh?

π neelder is not entirely sure what you're talking about yet.
<echelon-> you probed my system
<echelon-> I already am aware it was you
<echelon-> cause I don't have closed ports
<neelder> most everything it hit, i guess.  its already scrolled out of 
the scrollback.
<neelder> would you like another?
<echelon-> nah
<echelon-> anyways
<echelon-> I must be on my way
<neelder> i see.
<neelder> to where?
