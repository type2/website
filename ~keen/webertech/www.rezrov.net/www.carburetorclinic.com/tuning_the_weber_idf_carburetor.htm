Carbs on the VW Type 1 Engine</font></b><font size="5"><br>
</font></u><font size="4"><br>
</font>
<b>A fact</b> - Weber carburetors never come out of the box clean or jetted 
perfectly for your engine. If you order a set, they may come to you in the 
ballpark, but every engine is different, even two engines built with the same 
parts. You're going to be needing some different jet sizes. No way around it, if 
you want to get it right.  &nbsp; 
Buying jets is just part of it and you have to be ok with that if you want to go to the 
trouble to tune things well. Jets are expensive, so if you know someone that has 
a stockpile of them to lend you, get them and start tuning away. If not, you'll 
end up with a few sets that you can probably sell off for close to what you have 
in them.</font></p>
<p align="left"><b>&quot;Ok, well, I'm smart.. and I am handy with the drill bits..</b><font face="Arial"><b>&quot;</b>&nbsp; 
Well, good for you, sport.&nbsp; For the most part, stick to correctly sized and 
calibrated idle jets.&nbsp; The holes are SMALL, and small defects in your 
drillings will add up to big discrepancies in fuel delivery.&nbsp; If you want 
to get handy with the main or air correction jets, go for it, they're much 
bigger and will not suffer so badly because you sneezed.<br>
<br>
<b>First things first.</b>&nbsp; If you do not have an understanding of the otto 
cycle, go read about it so you know that what the engine does with intake and 
exhaust are not separate events from each other.&nbsp; The exhaust cycle 
contributes to the intake cycle.&nbsp; Given this fact and the carburetor's 
dependency on the health of the otto cycle, you must make sure that your engine 
is healthy before you spend any time tuning your carburetors.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>Your engine's health</b> - Are your valves 
correctly adjusted?&nbsp; Is your timing set correctly?&nbsp; Are you SURE?&nbsp; 
If not, find out.&nbsp; If you don't know what the right timing is, FIND OUT.&nbsp; 
Don't guess.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>Are your carbs CLEAN?&nbsp; Are your 
floats set correctly? </b>&nbsp;Clean the carbs and adjust the floats.
<a href="http://waitresses.servebeer.com:81/vwpage/idf/idfsetup.htm">Here</a> is 
a cleaning procedure that should clean out most carbs, especially new or fairly 
new ones. Older ones may need more attention.
If you slack on this step, the rest will be meaningless and frustrating.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">After you adjust the floats, you need to make 
sure your fuel pressure is about 3 to 3.5 psi.&nbsp; If it's too high or too low you 
will have poor results.&nbsp; Don't ASSUME anything about the fuel pressure.&nbsp; A stock 
pump under the wrong conditions can supply 10 psi of fuel pressure.&nbsp; I use an 
internally regulated 
rotary pump that runs about 3.5 psi.&nbsp; If your mechanical 
pump is pumping too much pressure you can add gaskets under it to get it right, 
or you can put a regulator in place.&nbsp; 
You also have to make sure you have the right pump and fuel pump rod 
combination.&nbsp; That is beyond the scope of this article.&nbsp; If you suspect there is 
a problem, deal with it and come back to this.&nbsp; I like the rotary pumps because 
you have instant fuel pressure, and your float bowls will be filled properly 
when you turn the key on.<br>
<br>
<b>Venturi selection</b> - For engines that rev pretty high (6000-7000 rpm), you are best off choosing 
vents that are about 2 to 4mm smaller than your intake valve size.<br>
<br>
For engines that are set up for torque, like bus engines, and other torque-happy 
applications, you can go a little smaller on the vents and get better low end 
response. For these, I'd recommend 4 to 6mm smaller than your intake valve size.<br>
<br>
So what happens if your vents are too big? You'll have reduced air-speed at low 
RPMs, which makes tuning harder. Air speed is one of the things that tells your 
different fuel circuits when to start to come on. It will be soggy down low.<br>
<br>
So what happens if your vents are too small? The undersized vents will restrict 
your engine's ability to breathe at higher RPMs.<br>
<br>
How critical is it? Not terribly, but if you're way off it will matter, and you 
will feel it. Putting 40 vents in a set of 44 IDFs with 40mm intake valves will 
be pretty soggy down low. Sticking with the 36's would be about right. Putting 
28 vents into a set of 40 IDFs on an engine with 40mm intake valves will limit 
your top end noticeably as well. A set of 44 IDFs, for example, can me made to 
work on many engine sizes with the standard 36 vents, but you might find that 
you could optimize them better if you are willing to spend the money and try 
some different vents that would be ideal for your application.<br>
<br>
<b>A few notes about jets</b><br>
More recently made jets are a little different in shape from the standard ones 
made by Weber, and there are some characteristics of them that could use a 
little attention. The key thing to watch out for when installing new jets is 
blockage and burrs. Don't assume that they're clean out of the package. Many 
have little bits of crap in them that will cause you misery if you just install 
them. Clean them out with carb spray and look in them to make sure you have them 
clean. Compressed air is very handy too for blowing them out after you spray 
them. Get them clean and dry before you install them. Many have burrs along the 
split areas where they compress to fit into your jet stack or idle jet holder. 
Inspect for this and get it cleaned off before you install them, or the burrs 
can chip off and fall into the stack or holder, causing blockage. Check it all. 
I like to clean them, install them in the holders or stacks, and then pull them 
out and clean it again, to be sure.. Then you know if anything was going to chip 
off it did, and has been cleaned out.<br>
<br>
It's wise to invest in a set of jet gauges to inspect the jets you use, to make 
sure they have not been changed. If you trust the stamped or screened writing, 
you might end up with results you do not expect. I've had them come to me sized 
wrong a couple times. While I don't like to ream jets, I think having a reamer/sizer 
is handy for checking them, and sizing them in a pinch. I personally think it is 
a wise (albeit expensive) choice to have an arsenal of correctly sized jets of 
all increments around the range that you need to use, but that's something you 
will likely accrue if you build a few different sized engines with some 
different combinations of carbs.<br>
<br>
<b>Idle jetting</b><br>
Once you've settled on your vents and your carbs are adjusted and cleaned up, 
you can choose your idle jet size.&nbsp; I've noted a formula in the books (basically 
1.6 * vent size) for idle jet sizes, and I have to say that vent size has little 
to do with idle jets, on the vw engine at least.&nbsp; More efficient engines can 
benefit from leaner idle jets, and less efficient engines probably need a little 
more. 50-60 is the range, and there is a trend 
toward larger jets for larger carb bodies. The throttle plate size is a key 
factor.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Idle jets are usually 45-65 in size, mostly 
in the 55 range. The rule is typically to multiply the vent size x 1.6 to 
arrive at your rough idle jet size, but what I've seen is that 50 to 55 is 
mainstream for about any 40 or 44 IDF. 55's will make sure you're not leaning 
out when you are tuning, so I start with those.<br>
<br>
<i>Before you do any more, MAKE SURE the air bypass screws are CLOSED.&nbsp; These 
are the little screws and lock nuts that are next to the mixture screws.&nbsp; If 
they are not closed, you'll probably never get it jetted right.</i></font></p>
<p align="left"><i><font face="Arial">Now.&nbsp; This article assumes that your 
engine is in top notch condition before you go about tuning the carbs.&nbsp; That 
means general engine health, timing, dwell, fuel delivery, fuel quality, all the 
way down the list.&nbsp; And all THAT's another subject.</font></i></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">After installing your idle jets, you close 
the idle mixture screws and unscrew them all about the same amount, maybe about 
1.5 turns out. Then, with your linkage disconnected, unscrew the idle speed 
screws (the ones the throttle arms rest on) until they are no longer touching 
the arms, and then turn them back until they are JUST touching. Now turn them in 
another half turn or so. Start the engine, and after you get it warmed up a 
little, see 
if it will idle ok. Now get your synchrometer (Unisyns suck, get a snail if you 
don't have one) and use the idle speed screws to even it out, and get you to a 
reasonable idle speed.&nbsp; Not too fast, keep the idle speed down for now, and get 
it even.&nbsp; If not then turn each mixture screw out another turn. If it STILL will 
not idle well, then your idle jets could be too small. Now get your synchrometer 
and use the idle speed screws to even it out, and get you to a reasonable idle 
speed.&nbsp; Not too fast, keep the idle speed down for now, and get it even 
using the snail.&nbsp; The snail readings at a proper idle should be between 4 
and 6 or so. </font>
</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Now go to each mixture screw one at a time 
and slowly turn it in (by slowly, turn it about 1/8 to 1/4 turn at a time and 
stop and wait for the response of the engine for a few seconds) until the engine 
begins to slow down (you'll be leaning out a cylinder). Now slowly back the 
screw back out (same method you used to screw it in) until that cylinder starts 
to pick up again and run smooth. <i>This is the critical point in the mixture 
adjustment.</i>&nbsp; Slowly open the screw a little more at a time until you 
reach a maximum idle speed.&nbsp; Don't go any further!&nbsp; If you're not 
sure, stop there, screw in back in until the idle drops, and then start to back 
it out again until you feel confident you have unscrewed the minimum amount that 
you have to in order to get max idle speed from that screw.&nbsp; Move on to 
the next cylinder. Do this until you have done all 4 cylinders.<br>
<br>
Now back to the synchrometer.&nbsp; Get them as close to the same as you can, and at 
the target idle speed you want.&nbsp; 800-900 is a reasonable range.&nbsp; Lower you can 
get and live with it, the better IMO.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">You're getting close now. Repeat the idle 
mixture procedure and when that is done, if your idle is right, you're done with 
the idle settings for now. If your idle is now off, go back to the synchrometer 
and idle speed screws.<br>
<br>
These iterations help you trim it out - you 
start low on idle, get your mixture right, and then move the idle up, 
and check mixture again, and if you have to adjust your mixture to the point 
that it messes up your idle, then you adjust that, and mixtures one more time 
and you should have it.&nbsp; If you don't have it by now, you are probably doing 
something wrong.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">So what do you do if two barrels on one of 
your carbs are not flowing the same? If it's only about quarter point or less, 
don't sweat it - it's most likely to affect your idle more than anything, maybe 
a weaker or more eager barrel at idle.&nbsp;&nbsp; If it is more than that, your carbs 
need attention, namely that the throttle shaft may be bent, or there may be a 
problem with the butterfly plate or its alignment, or something else causing 
different air flow.&nbsp; Some people recommend using the air bypass screws to 
adjust it, and this does help,&nbsp; but if it's more than a point off, it will 
cause problems that the air bypass can't account for. They need to be FIXED if 
this is the case. I never use the air bypass screws for more than about a point 
of difference.<br>
<br>
<b>Main jetting</b><br>
Now with the idle jetting done, main jets are next in line. Assuming F11 
emulsion tubes, your starting point for main jets is about 4.1 to 4.3 x the vent 
size. So for a 36 vent, your main jet should be roughly 145 to 155 to start. 
150's a good choice to start with unless you're feeling lucky, in which case you 
can start with a 145. With a 145-150 main jet, you'll be pretty close with a 36 
vent. Similar rules work for smaller and larger vents, though once you get past 
40mm vents, the rules don't seem to apply so well.<br>
<br>
<b>Air jetting</b><br>
Air jets are more empirical, but a good starting point for them is about 200 if 
you have 145 mains. If your mains are considerably smaller, like 135 or 115 or 
something, a 160 to 180 air jet is a better place to start. Start there and 
don't mess with them until you know the other jets are right.<br>
<br>
<b>Synchronization</b><br>
This is a topic that does not get enough attention. Synchronization is 
EVERYTHING after the jetting is done. Synchronization will such a difference in 
the way it runs you just can't believe it when they are right. Unfortunately all 
the linkage that is out there has certain characteristics that keep your 
synchronization from being perfect all the time, so all you can do is get it 
close and keep after it every once in a while.<br>
<br>
The biggest problem with synchronization is keeping the geometry correct. This 
is hard to understand without illustrations of why, but if you just trust that 
it's important, you can avoid all the rest.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>Linkage<br>
</b>There are different kinds of linkage out there, and a lot of people use 
crossbar linkage, while some others use bellcrank type linkage.&nbsp; Each one has 
its application, but I prefer bellcrank when I can use it and can get good 
linkage.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>Crossbar linkage: How to ensure that your 
downrods have the right geometry</b><br>
<br>
With your downrods, if you can position the crossbar arms so that your downrods 
are vertical (left to right), that will help matters, and complicate the 
situation less. Once you have achieved that, you can work on making sure that 
they are both at the same angle (leaning from front to back of the car). Use an 
angle finder, and read what the rods are, and use washers to get them the same. 
There shouldn't be a lot of difference to start with, if you have the right 
linkage for your setup. Different intake manifold types (offset versus straight) 
will use different linkage setups. If your crossbar is sitting at an angle with 
respect to your fanshroud, you have the wrong linkage.<br>
<br>
Once your downrods are at the same angle side for side, then your 
synchronization will be easier, because the throttles should now be offsetting 
the same amount on each side throughout the full range.<br>
<br>
Now, to synch your carbs, loosen the nuts on one downrod, and use the rod's 
opposed threads to set the carbs so they are opening at the same time. Be 
careful when doing this (I do it with the engine off) so that you don't open 
them a lot too many times.. you'll dump a bunch of fuel into the engine if you 
do. When you test, make sure that you are using the point where the cable 
connects to the throttle arm in the middle of the crossbar. If you twist at one 
of the outer arms, you will not get accurate results. Just push on the arm at 
the point where the cable meets it, so that you are applying the same force that 
the cable does when it pulls. If you put your hand on the crossbar and twist it 
using your thumb or something on the middle arm, you are still applying a force 
that the crossbar will not experience under normal conditions.<br>
<br>
Watch the throttles, and compare what both sides are doing. They should be 
opening at the same exact moment. Realize that as the engine warms up the 
geometry changes slightly so there may be some difference between hot and cold 
engine. I like to warm mine up before I do this. After you get them synched 
right, tighten down the nuts so that both the heim joints are centered to their 
positions. I rotate the joints so that they are both resting against the 
position they would be pulled to when you tighten the nuts, and then I tighten 
them. Be sure to not let the rod twist when you position or tighten them. You 
may find that tightening the nuts changes the geometry slightly, so you may have 
to compensate a little bit for this on the rod.<br>
<br>
After you get the nuts tight, check it again, and repeat if necessary.<br>
<br>
Why this matters so much: Once you get them synched perfect, you will FEEL how 
much better it runs, especially on low throttle lower RPM. If you have a head 
temperature gauge, you will see that when the linkage is not right, one side 
will run warmer than the other. If the left side throttle opens first, the left 
side will run warmer, especially at low throttle low RPMs.<br>
<br>
The last thing you should do if you have never done it: Loosen the throttle 
cable from the center arm and have someone push the gas pedal to the floor. Pull 
the cable tight, and then snug the connector. This will ensure that you do not 
put undue stress on the throttle shafts on the carbs at full throttle. If you 
put too much pressure on them you can twist the throttle shafts too much and 
bend them. This is especially true of setups that have the return spring and 
stop on the FRONT of one of the carbs, which is the way most Weber setups are 
out of the box. I use the CB Weblink kit to put the springs both on the throttle 
linkage side, to help with synchronization.<br>
<br>
This with some practice and a good feel for what you are doing will help a lot 
with making sure your engine runs smooth.<br>
<br>
<b>Drive it</b><br>
Something you should understand about tuning from this point. Your accelerator 
pumps are going to try to fool you unless you understand their purpose and 
function.<br>
<br>
Accelerator pumps are there to compensate for some physics. The fact is that 
fuel is heavier than air, and it takes longer for the fuel to pick up speed in 
the circuits than it does for the air to pick up speed in the throats. So when 
you stomp the gas, the air starts moving faster a lot sooner than the fuel does. 
The accelerator pumps are there to provide a little extra fuel during that short 
time it takes for the fuel to catch up. Keep this in mind when you are tuning 
the jets, and avoid rapid pedal movements for now.<br>
<br>
It really helps to have a tach, and an air fuel gauge, and I would say that a 
tach is next to necessary, while an air fuel gauge is a luxury that you can do 
without unless you are FINE tuning, and going for near perfect in terms of 
mileage and power. <br>
<br>
Take the car out and drive it. Pay attention to what's going on at about 1500 to 
2000 RPM, and at 2000 to 3000 RPM, and from 3000 to 4000 RPM. While the RPM 
bands will vary depending on what size carbs, what vents, and what engine combo 
you have, these are pretty safe ranges to look at. <br>
<br>
1500 to 2000 RPM is almost purely idle jets in action. Keep the pedal steady 
here, in 3rd gear so you can see what it does with a slight load. If this area 
is running ok, move on. If it feels weak or soggy, you might need different idle 
jets. Unfortunately, it's sometimes hard to tell if it's rich or lean unless you 
are experienced here. This is where an air fuel meter will help you out. What 
you can try is opening up your mixture screws about half turn and see if it 
feels better. If it doesn't, then it might be too rich. If it does, then your 
idle jets may be too lean. For those of you with air-fuel gauges, about 13-13.5 
or so is what I like. Move on to the next range.<br>
<br>
2000 to 3000 RPM is the &quot;transition&quot; stage. This is the part where the main 
circuit starts to take over. Your idle jets start to matter less here, and your 
air corrector jets are the progressively deciding factor for why your engine is 
running the way it is. With the pedal steady, make note of how it feels in here, 
and move on.<br>
<br>
3000 to 4000 RPM is where your main jets are really doing their job. With the 
pedal steady, if it feels lean here, (sort of like it is running out of fuel) 
then you might want to try going up a main jet size. If not, try going down one 
and see how it runs. Go down until it starts to feel lean (weaker with maybe 
some popping). When you feel it go lean, move back up a size and you are done 
with the mains. For those of you with air-fuel gauges, about 13.0 - 13.5 or so 
is what I like.<br>
<br>
<b>Now, back to the transition stage.</b> If it felt lean there before you did 
anything, and the main circuit felt lean, determine of moving the main jet up 
helped the transition stage. When the idles and mains are both right, the 
transition should be pretty good too. If your mains and your idles feel good, 
but your transition does not, try going up a couple sizes on the air jet and see 
if that helps. If not, try to go up a couple sizes more and see. By now you 
should have it cleaned up. If you STILL have problems with transition, something 
else may be wrong.&nbsp; Read the article to the left about transition.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>Accelerator pump settings</b><br>
Once everything else feels right at steady state, then you can start playing 
with the accelerator pumps. While there are different pump jets and bypass 
valves, you can usually get what you need out of the ones that come on the carbs 
out of the box. First, make sure that they are adjusted the same. Drive it, and 
see what happens when you give it gas more quickly. If when you are in second or 
third gear, and you push the pedal from cruise to WOT over the course of about a 
half second, and it bogs, try unscrewing each accelerator pump nut about 3 turns 
and try it again. If it's worse, then they were too lean, and you should go back 
the other way. Try 3 turns at a time until they are right. You shouldn't need 
more than about 1/2&quot; of rod sticking out of the nut. If you do, you might have 
some timing issues you need to deal with. For those of you with an air-fuel 
meter, your meter's response to mashing the pedal should be as close to steady 
as possible, but that's not realistic to expect. If your engine falls on its 
face, and the meter goes lean, screw the nuts in about three turns on each side, 
and try again. Same rules for if it goes rich for any period of time, like two 
seconds or so. What I like to do is back off the screws until it falls on its 
face, and then start screwing them back in until it doesn't anymore. Too much 
fuel from the accelerator pumps is going to cause the excess fuel to wash oil 
off the cylinders, and cause you poor mileage.<br>
<br>
<b>Common mistakes</b><br>
Lots of folks are driving around thinking their state of tune is good, when in 
fact, they've covered up symptoms with incorrect jetting. The only ONLY way to 
know for sure is to have an accurate air/fuel meter, but you can avoid a lot of 
it by just paying close attention to what the different circuits are doing. For 
dialing the jets, paying attention to what happens as you mash the pedal or 
right afterwards is wrong. The accelerator pump is screwing with things when you 
do that. Jetting requires paying attention to what's happening at steady state, 
during fixed RPM ranges, under different conditions.<br>
<br>
What happens under WOT is not an ideal way to assess your jetting, at least 
under heavy load and at lower RPM ranges. Things will go rich there, and should 
due to what your engine needs. If you have an Air/Fuel meter and it is dropping 
down to the 11's or something when you nail it, worry about some of that when 
you have the rest tuned. Don't shoot for getting that right until you get the 
rest right. That part may never be perfect, but you can get it closer after you 
do the rest.<br>
<br>
If you think you have it tuned, drive it for a while, a distance, a few days, 
whatever, and see how you feel about it. If you try to jet an engine that has 
been running really rich for a while, it may take a few stages of leaning it 
before you get it right, due to carbon buildup, and may take some new plugs to 
be sure. Plugs are another factor that has to be paid sufficient heed to get 
things right. That's another topic, but about 0.025&quot; for stock, more like 0.040&quot; 
for CDI and such.<br>
<br>
New engines: Never try to tune a new engine perfectly. It's going to change. I 
tend to suggest running them a little rich in the beginning to keep temps down 
and make sure you don't lean it out while your rings are trying to seat.<br>
<br>
<b>What kind of mileage should you expect?</b> Depends on how you drive. If you 
drive it like you're sick of the high gas prices you should get close to 20 if 
everything is right, maybe even more. I get about 25. You can get very good 
mileage if you lean things out close to 14 across the board, reduce your 
accelerator pump action to the very minimum, with just a hint of hesitation when 
you punch it, and use a vacuum advance distributor (SVDA) with the ports on the 
carbs (many have vacuum ports you can attach to a T fitting and then to an SVDA 
distributor that is tuned right for use with dual carbs. Not all cam/head setups 
are going to work well with an SVDA distributor, but many will do fine.<br>
<br>
If you drive with a heavy foot, then face facts. Your mileage is going to suck.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps you. </font></p>
