<p>Setting up your rockers</p>
<p>This article discusses setting up rockers on the VW Type 1 engine.&nbsp; The 
rockers discussed here are cup adjuster/wiper style high ratio rockers.&nbsp; 
Though similar principles apply to the stock style rockers, different methods 
must be used.</p>
<p>In this article, I give my experience with setting up rockers on my 2332 
engine with a Webcam 86b camshaft.&nbsp; Three different rocker sets were used 
to test results.</p>
<p>Rocker set #1 - Scat 1.4 </p>
<p>Starting with these, the first thing I did was check the alignment of the 
rockers with visual observation and measurement.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="rog02.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p>
<p>In the picture above, a dial indicator is used on the spring retainer.&nbsp; 
Light springs were used to make measurements.&nbsp; Note the lash cap on the 
valve stem.&nbsp; Although in this article, you will only see one valve being 
checked, checking all of them is important.&nbsp; Once you think you have one 
set correctly, check them all.&nbsp; Any differences may indicate a problem or 
may dictate what you choose for pushrod length.&nbsp; Valves are not always set 
in the head exactly the same, though in a perfect world they would be.</p>
<p>What we want to do is measure lift range and check conditions at zero, half 
and full lift.</p>
<p>Dial indicator at valve fully closed : 0.8340 <br>
Dial indicator at valve full lift : 0.3055 <br>
<br>
Total lift is 0.8340-0.3055 = 0.5285 <br>
<br>
Lift of my cam is 0.575 @ 1.5 rockers (86b) <br>
Doing the math, the lift of the lobe is 0.3833 <br>
<br>
Using 0.5285/0.3833, the lift on MY rockers gives a ratio of 1.38 using my Scat 
1.25's. That works out, since that's what they really measure. <br>
<br>
So.. half lift = 0.3055 + (0.5285/2) = 0.5698 <br>
<br>
When I rotate to that point, my adjuster is nearly in line with the pushrod, using no shims and a 
0.080 lash cap. </p>

<p>Here are the rockers at zero, half, and full lift.</p>

<p>Some things to notice - at zero lift look at the wiper pad on the lash cap.&nbsp; 
It is basically centered.&nbsp; At half lift it is not, it rides up the lash 
cap, and at full lift it is even more.&nbsp; Also the red line represents the 
surface of the lash cap extended down at half lift.&nbsp; To reduce the amount 
of the wiper pad's vertical translation during the range of operation, this 
would ideally be passing through the center of the rocker shaft axis.&nbsp; But 
as you can see it is not.</p>

<p>What would be ideal is for the wiper pad to be centered at half lift, and 
rock above and below this slightly.&nbsp; </p>

<p>So what can be done here?</p>

<p>Well, non centered axis is not the worst thing that can happen, but what's 
important is that the wiper needs to be centered on the lash cap so that the net 
action of the wiper is across the center.&nbsp; But to get there, the valve stem 
would have to protrude more, or the rockers would have to sit further into the 
head, which would require milling the rocker stands or the blocks and doing some 
clearancing.&nbsp; Ew.</p>

<p>Well, after simulating a 0.180&quot; lash cap, or a longer stem, or milling the 
stands or blocks down 0.100&quot;, and using 0.080 lash caps, this picture shows the 
rocker at half lift. The axis is on, but although closer, the centering on the 
stem is not. AND I have determined that I would have to clearance the head 
bosses for the rockers to clear, since they are a little wider than the rocker 
blocks. In this case, I feel the problem lies with the rocker design. </p>

<p><img border="0" src="rog100-1.jpg" width="501" height="709"></p>

<p>So what else can a person do here?</p>

<p>Well, fortunately these are not the only rockers on the market, and though 
these might work well for some applications, they're not going to for mine.&nbsp; 
Moving on.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Next up is the Berg 1.4 rockers.&nbsp; I scored a set lightly used, and put 
them on.&nbsp; This is how it fit for me:</p>

<p><img border="0" src="rogberghalf.jpg" width="409" height="635"></p>

<p>The geometry is looking pretty good!&nbsp; See the axis and the engagement at 
the cap at half lift is nearly perfect!</p>

<p>However, the other issue is the angle of the adjuster to the pushrod.&nbsp; 
At half lift I would like to see it parallel with the pushrod, because that 
basically means that the pushrod cup in the adjuster will see minimal angles 
with the pushrod, as minimal as is possible.&nbsp; Looking at what I have now:</p>

<p><img border="0" src="rogbergadstrang.jpg" width="566" height="571"></p>

<p>You can see that they are not in line, but it's not that bad.. and my pushrod 
had screwed in a little and made it look even worse here than it really is.&nbsp; 
However, there is one more set I wanted to try, the CB rockers.&nbsp; So let's 
see what happened with those.</p>

<p>... Next time!</p>
