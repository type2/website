<p><b><u><font face="Arial" size="5">Weber IDF Carburetors - Setting up 
out of the box</font></u></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial">So, you just got a new set of Weber IDF 
carburetors, and you just pulled them out of the box.&nbsp; Cool, you think, I 
will just bolt 'em up and run 'em.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Yeah, good luck with that.&nbsp; You'll 
be bitching in short order about how crappy they are and how you can't seem to 
make them work right.&nbsp; Well, let me show you why, while I am setting up a 
pair, out of the box, BRAND NEW.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">After you finish with this, you might 
want to read my article on tuning them.&nbsp; It can be found
<a href="http://waitresses.servebeer.com:81/vwpage/idf/idftuning.htm">here</a></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="idf01.jpg" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Ok, so here we are, with my new pair of 
Redline Weber 48 IDF carburetors.&nbsp; Here is the first one I will tackle.&nbsp; 
Looks pretty clean outside, and ready to go.&nbsp; Well, it's not.&nbsp; Inside 
it's a mess.&nbsp; Onward.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial">Removing jets, valves, tubes, etc.</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="images/setup/idf02.jpg" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Pull the mixture screws</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/setup/idf03.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p>
<p>Remove the O-rings and metal rings from the idle mixture screw holes.&nbsp; 
Put these aside, not to be put in cleaner.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/setup/idf04.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p>

<p>Remove the idle jet holders, jets, and O-rings.&nbsp; Put the O-rings aside, 
not to be put in cleaner.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/setup/idf05.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p>

<p>Remove the plug and the fuel fitting other side</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/setup/idf06.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p>

<p>If your carburetors have the cold start valves on them, remove them.&nbsp; 
When you put it back together, you can either use blockoff plates or just put 
these back on.&nbsp; I'd recommend block off plates if you can get them, since 
these aren't used on the VW engine, unless you are a masochist.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/setup/idf07.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p>

<p>Remove the main jet stacks (these are comprised of the emulsion tube holders, 
emulsion tubes, air correction jets, and main jets, all in one unit.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/setup/idf08.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p>

<p>Remove the top retaining screws (5).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/setup/idf09.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p>

<p>Remove the tops carefully.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/setup/idf10.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p>

<p>The picture is not showing the extent of filth, but it's pretty dirty.&nbsp; 
Lots of dusty film.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/setup/idf11.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p>

<p>This is what fell out of the carburetor body when I turned it over and tapped 
it a couple times.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/setup/idf12.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p>


<p>Remove the starter jets.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p><img border="0" src="images/setup/idf13.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p>


<p>Remove the accelerator pump delivery valve, pump jet, and two copper washers 
from each barrel.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p><img border="0" src="images/setup/idf15.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p>


<p>Look down the throats at the venturis, and see if they look pushed away from 
the barrel wall on the side where the retaining screws are.&nbsp; If they do, 
loosen the locknuts, and back the screws off until they are loose.&nbsp; Then 
tighten them until you JUST see the vents start to push away from the barrel 
wall, and stop.&nbsp; Then tighten the locknuts back down.&nbsp; You don't want 
these to be warped, but you don't want them loose either.</p>


<p><b>Soak in cleaner</b></p>


<p>Now, pull the main jet stacks and idle jet stacks apart (<a href="#diagram">see diagram 
below, parts 8,9,10,11</a>).&nbsp; </p>


<p><img border="0" src="images/setup/idf19.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p>


<p>You should now have this mess.&nbsp; Put all this stuff except the 
accelerator pump diaphragm and O-rings in carburetor parts cleaner.&nbsp; For 
this article, I used 
Berryman B-9 ChemDip, but I use an ultrasonic tank now..&nbsp; Chemdip is bad news so be very careful using it.&nbsp; 
When you open it, put a rag over the top when you open, because it may build 
pressure.&nbsp; If you seal the lid while the parts are in it, it will 
definitely build pressure, so either put the top on loose, or be very careful 
opening it.&nbsp; You don't want this stuff on you or your eyes, etc.&nbsp; </p>


<p>Let the parts sit in the cleaner overnight or at least a few hours.&nbsp; 
Take them out, rinse in hot water, and clean them throroughly with carb spray cleaner and compressed 
air.&nbsp; If you don't have compressed air, get a can of it.&nbsp; Don't skip 
blowing the parts out.&nbsp; Wear eye protection if you are a spaz.</p>


<p>As far as the carburetor body, spray the outside, the inside, and all 
openings with carburetor spray cleaner.&nbsp; Blow it out with compressed air.&nbsp; 
Do NOT close off any holes with the blowgun.&nbsp; Keep some distance.. you 
don't want to build a lot of pressure in the circuits.</p>


<p>Spray the top assembly off with carb spray cleaner and blow air lightly on it 
to dry.&nbsp; You can take the float off if you want by removing the brass pin 
that holds it in place.&nbsp; If you do this, you'll note that one of the sides 
that the pin goes into has a slot in it.&nbsp; If you pry this apart to free the 
pin you will probably break it.&nbsp; Just grab the pin with some pliers and 
twist it out instead.&nbsp; Blow air through the fuel inlet with the float 
hanging down to make sure the passage is open and you get all the moisture out.</p>


<p><b>Adjust the floats</b> to about 10mm according to the methods in this 
diagram.&nbsp; Folks have differing opinions about float height.&nbsp; I realize 
that the diagram says 10.5-11.5mm, but I use 10mm.&nbsp; The fact 
is there is no one perfect number you can throw out that is going to make 
everyone's carburetors work perfectly.&nbsp; This is the ballpark you SHOULD be 
in though.. anything outside this range suggests something else is not right.&nbsp;  The drop measurements are not nearly as critical.. the floats will 
hopefully never drop that fast.  If they do you have other problems.:</p>


<p><img border="0" src="images/setup/idffloat01.jpg" width="600" height="461"></p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>What I do:&nbsp; I take the top and position it so that the float is *just* 
resting on the ball.&nbsp; You can either position the top sideways and let the 
float swing like a door, and tilt it so it just rests on the ball, or you can 
hold it at an angle like I have it here.&nbsp; </p>


<p><img border="0" src="images/setup/idf20.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p>


<p>I just set them to about 10mm and use the caliper OD arms to check the float.&nbsp; 
The tabs that are illustrated on the above picture, in red, are what you bend.&nbsp; 
The red one is for the 10mm setting, and the blue one is for the other.</p>


<p>When you do it, make sure you are measuring with the needle valve ball NOT 
compressed.&nbsp; One way to do this easy is turn the assembly sideways, so the 
float is rotating on the pin like a door on a hinge, and the tilt it so that the 
float is just resting on the ball, and then measure.&nbsp; Use the tabs to set 
the float correctly.&nbsp; Mine out of the box was about 14mm and 20mm which is 
way way off.</p>

<p>Once done cleaning, reassembly is reverse of disassembly.&nbsp; Don't over 
tighten, and take your time.&nbsp; Jetting is another story.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Hope this helps.&nbsp; This is a basic procedure for cleaning out the crap 
that gets in them at assembly time.</p>

<p>Additional diagrams for parts reference (note this one is a little different, 
older Italian model with pever style accelerator pumps. It serves as a fair 
reference for the rest.</p>
