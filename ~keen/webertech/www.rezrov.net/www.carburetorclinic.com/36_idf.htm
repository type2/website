<p><b><font face="Arial" size="5">Weber 36 IDF rebuild 
project (updated 10/24/07)</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Welcome to my project page for rebuilding a pair 
of old Weber 36 IDFs to work with small to midrange sized VW Type 1 engines.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">These pages are a work in progress.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">I recently bought a set of old Italian Weber 36 
IDF carburetors.&nbsp; The general condition was good but the fitment of them and 
calibration to a VW engine is going to need a few things to make it work as it 
should.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">I will update this page as I get through the 
project.&nbsp; Questions,
<a href="mailto:mark.harney@gmail.com?subject=Your%2036%20IDF%20rebuild%20project">
contact me</a>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">NOTE: The MODIFICATIONS listed here for 
the idle air bushings are SPECIFIC to these units, and to CERTAIN 40 IDFs that 
have the same style mixture screws, same size air bushings, and FIVE progression 
ports.. don't just do this because they are IDFs.&nbsp; If you are not sure, ask 
me.&nbsp; Send me pics of your carbs and I can tell you if they are subject to 
similar issues in individual runner or centermount application on the VW 
aircooled engine.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="5">Inspection</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial">I've started out with a set that looked like the 
pictures below.&nbsp; These pictures show the general condition of the carburetors.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">
<img src="36IDFrebuild/36idfmed01.jpg" border="0" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Note the use of the enrichment circuit.&nbsp; Whatever 
car this was on was afforded that luxury.&nbsp; You can also see the special barrel 
nut stud that was used to attach to the air cleaner most likely.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<img src="36IDFrebuild/36idfmed02.jpg" border="0" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">You can see from this shot that the fuel lines 
were different sizes going into this carburetor.&nbsp; The lower one is what we're 
all more accustomed to.&nbsp; I will probably plug the top one and use the lower one.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<img src="36IDFrebuild/36idfmed03.jpg" border="0" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Not much to say here that you haven't already seen 
but it's another shot.&nbsp; The underside looks good.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<img src="36IDFrebuild/36idfmed04.jpg" border="0" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Here you can see that the butterflies are not 
damaged and are relatively clean.&nbsp; Some normal deposit under the center holes of 
the throttle shaft.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<img src="36IDFrebuild/36idfmed05.jpg" border="0" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Shot of the mixture screw cluster for one barrel.&nbsp; 
This shot shows you a brass plug that hides the progression circuit holes into 
the barrel, a CO tube for calibrating mixture (not a way we use that much 
anymore, I prefer Air-Fuel meters and flow meters to do the calibrating), a lead 
plug in an unused air bypass circuit to the right of the mixture screw, and 
finally, above and to the right of the CO tube, is the boss for a vacuum line 
suitable for a vacuum advance pot on a distributor.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<img src="36IDFrebuild/36idfmed06.jpg" border="0" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">This shot shows the other side of the same 
carburetor, mirror image, sans the vacuum port boss.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<img src="36IDFrebuild/36idfmed07.jpg" border="0" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">This shot shows how the throttle shaft is 
terminated on the &quot;back&quot; side.&nbsp; These two carburetors are an opposed pair, so 
when installed, they both have this plate on the firewall side of the engine, 
and the speed screws, return springs, and arms are all on the service side.&nbsp; 
Nice feature, saves reconciling that or having to do a Weblink conversion.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<img src="36IDFrebuild/36idfmed08.jpg" border="0" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Top of the carb - again not much to say here.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="5">Tear down</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<img src="36IDFrebuild/36idfmed09.jpg" border="0" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;After taking off the top, jet stacks and 
enrichment control, I see that inside is basically very clean, and does not have 
evidence of contamination or water damage at all.&nbsp; Some slight mineral deposits 
on the paper gasket, but not much of anything else.&nbsp; The complete idle jet 
stacks were missing from this carburetor, so I will have to source those if I 
can.&nbsp; I have an extra set on a core, but I don't like to sacrifice what parts I 
can source.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">
<img src="36IDFrebuild/36idfmed10.jpg" border="0" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Jet stacks were 135 main, 220 air, and F50 
emulsion tubes.&nbsp; This is not the ideal setup for VW Type 1 engines, and I will 
explain more about that later, relative to the behavior of these.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<img src="36IDFrebuild/36idfmed11.jpg" border="0" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Another picture of the cover.. the floats were not 
bad off for measurement and the condition is great.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<img src="36IDFrebuild/36idfmed12.jpg" border="0" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Picture of inside.. really pretty clean.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<img src="36IDFrebuild/36idfmed13.jpg" border="0" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">These have been sitting where a spider could find 
a home and spin a web.&nbsp; Note the design of the acclerator pump jets.&nbsp; If you 
have ever had a set of Weber ICTs, these will look quite familiar.&nbsp; They are 
sealed using o-rings, and there are no valves in them&nbsp; The valve is similar to 
the setup used in Dellorto DRLA carbs in that there is a ram and a ball bearing 
that avoids reversion of the shot into the bowl on each side, as a check valve.&nbsp; 
These have them under the nozzles whereas the DRLA has them under an access 
screw.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Something else of interest here, the idle air 
bushings (little brass opening to the right of the accelerator pump nuzzle) is 
LARGE compared to what we see on Spanish and other Italian models of the IDF.&nbsp; 
These are about a 2.00mm opening!&nbsp; The regular size we deal with is about 
1.15mm.&nbsp; The other difference that is related is that this carburetor has 5 
progression ports, whereas the later models have 4, and sizes of the ports vary 
quite a bit.&nbsp; This model is very close to the Dellorto DRLA carbs in terms of 
air bushing and progression ports.&nbsp; I'm sure they will respond better with 
smaller idle air bushings.&nbsp; These typically run kind of lean in the transition 
area.&nbsp; After they are cleaned, they will get soldered, re-drilled at 1.20mm, and 
tops will be resurfaced.&nbsp; If the bushings are too small at this point, then I 
will drill them larger, to about 1.50mm and try that.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<img src="36IDFrebuild/36idfmed16.jpg" border="0" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Shot of the spot where you would expect to see a 
removable bypass valve.&nbsp; What is here is fixed and really non-serviceable 
without a lot of work.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<img src="36IDFrebuild/36idfmed17.jpg" border="0" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Shot of the linkage arms on the carb.&nbsp; Some of 
that is not necessary for our use.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<img src="36IDFrebuild/36idfmed18.jpg" border="0" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Shot of the model number.&nbsp; There are many 
different IDF bodies out there.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">
<img src="36IDFrebuild/36idfmed19.jpg" border="0" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Shot of hte body nearly torn down all the way.&nbsp; 
Enrichment circuit guts are next.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">
<img src="36IDFrebuild/36idfmed20.jpg" border="0" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Another shot down the barrels.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">
<img src="36IDFrebuild/36idfmed21.jpg" border="0" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Venturis are 30mm and aux vents are looking good 
on the sealing area.&nbsp; 32mm vents will go back in these.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">
<img src="36IDFrebuild/36idfmed22.jpg" border="0" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The three pieces on the right will not have to go 
back on the throttle shaft.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">
<img src="36IDFrebuild/36idfmed23.jpg" border="0" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Accelerator pump jets are snap in style like the 
ICT, and are sized very small.&nbsp; With the spring style acclerator pump rods, this 
is a good size for carbs this small.&nbsp; You can crank down on the springs and get 
a little more spray if you want it.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">
<img src="36IDFrebuild/36idfmed24.jpg" border="0" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Shot down the acclerator pump circuit.. the item 
in the hole is the end of one of the brass rams pictured below.&nbsp; Under the ram 
is a steel ball that serves as a check valve.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">
<img src="36IDFrebuild/36idfmed25.jpg" border="0" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Lose any of this and you have a problem.&nbsp; Modern 
versions now have the check valve in the bolt that holds the nozzles.&nbsp; Both 
systems work well.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="5">Going in the tank</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Here are the parts going through the first aqueous 
cleaning process.&nbsp; This process removes oils, greases, dirt, and other stuff 
stuck to the outside of the parts.&nbsp; The circuits don't get much but a rinse from 
this process.&nbsp; The solution is Simple Green cleaner mixed at about a 10:1 ratio 
with water (water is the major).&nbsp; The solution is heated to about 150 degrees 
and the parts are dropped in for about 15 minutes.&nbsp; Parts will turn dark if you 
leave them in too long.&nbsp; The rinse is a hot water rinse for several minutes with 
submersion on the complex parts.&nbsp; Parts are blown dry with compressed air.&nbsp; 
Simple parts like screws and such don't get blown dry, only vents, jets, bodies, 
tubes, etc.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">
<img src="36IDFrebuild/tank02.jpg" border="0" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Into the hot tank they go.&nbsp; I have a small tank, 
so I have to change the chemicals out frequently.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">
<img src="36IDFrebuild/tank03.jpg" border="0" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Cook it up!</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">
<img src="36IDFrebuild/36idfmed26.jpg" border="0" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">After cleaning cycle. Here is the whole carb minus 
idle jets and holders, mixture springs, and disposables.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">
<img src="36IDFrebuild/solderedairbushings.jpg" border="0" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">After this process, I went ahead and closed up the 
air bleeds and re-drilled them to 1.20mm.&nbsp; They look like ass, but they're 
better than the pics look.&nbsp; The holes on air jets do not have to be as precise 
as fuel jets, IMO.&nbsp; They are within 0.05mm I am sure.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">After the parts were degreased, they were put in 
the tank with ultrasonic cleaning solution. They come out looking a lot the 
same, with the exception of carbon deposits and hard stains greatly reduced.&nbsp; 
Carbon deposits are all removed.&nbsp; I've put pistons in this cleaner for 30 
minutes and had them come out literally looking brand new, sans scuffing and 
such.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The parts that can still use some cleaning are 
brass parts.&nbsp; They just don't get that gleam they had out of the box.&nbsp; Using my 
secret formula, I tank the brass parts, and they come out looking new inside and 
out, no etching, no dimensional changes, just CLEAN.&nbsp; I scrub the throttle 
plates to check for burrs and such.</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">
<img src="36IDFrebuild/cleanbrassmed.jpg" border="0" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Now inspection and reassembly is next!</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="5">Covers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Now that the parts have been cleaned up, it's time 
to reassemble them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">But, first things first here.. these covers have 
two fuel fittings each, and I only need one on each.&nbsp; You can either leave two 
on one of the covers, and use that in lieu of a &quot;T&quot; fitting, or you can 
eliminate one on each and use them with a &quot;T&quot; fitting.&nbsp; I prefer the latter.&nbsp; So 
to remove the fitting, I just cut it off and drill it.&nbsp; It can't be pulled out 
due to the way it is installed.. I'll show more about that later.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">
<img src="36IDFrebuild/36idfmed30.jpg" border="0" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Here is the cover with both fittings.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">
<img src="36IDFrebuild/36idfmed45.jpg" border="0" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">After taking a cutoff tool to the fitting, and 
then using a disc to sand it flush.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">
<img src="36IDFrebuild/36idfmed46.jpg" border="0" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Fixtured and ready to drill.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">
<img src="36IDFrebuild/36idfmed50.jpg" border="0" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Let the chips fly!&nbsp; Use WD40 or something to keep 
things slippery during the cut.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">
<img src="36IDFrebuild/36idfmed53.jpg" border="0" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">This is the remainder of the bushing as it slipped 
out with the bit during one of my retractions.&nbsp; The right side is the end of the 
fitting and the left side is the end closest to what I cut off.&nbsp; See the groove 
in the fitting?&nbsp; That was held in by swaged aluminum from the cover, like a 
retainer, hence difficult to remove any other way without risking damage to the 
cover.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">
<img src="36IDFrebuild/36idfmed60.jpg" border="0" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Cleaned, tapped, cleaned again, and ready for a 
plug.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">
<img src="36IDFrebuild/36idfmed64.jpg" border="0" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">All plugged with an iron plug.&nbsp; Brass or aluminum 
will work too.&nbsp; For those of you that want to go on about expansion rates and 
such, do the math, figure out how little it matters here, and then figure in the 
thread sealant, and get outta my way.&nbsp; :)</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">Now we'll move on to assembling the cover and 
setting the float.&nbsp; This is perhaps the most overlooked and ironically the most 
important part of calibration.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The standard 40/44/48 IDF rebuild kits are NOT the 
ticket on these carburetors.. you have to get the kits that are SPECIFIC to 36 
IDFs.&nbsp; Here is such a kit.. Weber does not offer them anymore.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">
<img src="36IDFrebuild/36idfmed65.jpg" border="0" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Nice Italian kit.. yay!</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">Now, reassmbling the cover starts with flipping it 
over, installing the filter, drain plug, seat assembly, and top cover.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">
<img src="36IDFrebuild/36idfmed66.jpg" border="0" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">See how the cover gasket is different?&nbsp; Compare it 
to a typical IDF gasket.. different hole patterns.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">A comment about the needle.&nbsp; Look at the picture 
and you will see that on the non-business end of the needle there is a steel 
ball captive in the needle.&nbsp; Under it is a spring.&nbsp; All IDF needles are like 
this.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">
<img src="36IDFrebuild/36idfmed69.jpg" border="0" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">When you adjust your float, make sure that the tab 
is not compressing this ball!&nbsp; It's all in how you hold the cover when you 
measure.. just let the float tab REST on the ball.. not compress it.&nbsp; Some are 
more sensitive than others, but the rule is the same.&nbsp; Yes, my fingers are a 
little dry.&nbsp; Get over it.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">After preassembly, install the float and get out 
your measuring equipment</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">
<img src="36IDFrebuild/36idfmed67.jpg" border="0" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">I like to use calipers to do the measurements.. 
You can either use the depth gauge, or the ID measuring tool.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">Measure from the paper gasket to the bottom edge 
of the float.&nbsp; SPRING NOT COMPRESSED!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">
<img src="36IDFrebuild/36idfmed68.jpg" border="0" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Experience has told me that THESE particular 
carburetors seem to respond best to floats set to roughly 9mm.&nbsp; Most others are 
better at 10-11mm, but these seem to do pretty good at 9mm.&nbsp; I've never tried to 
figure out why, but I am sure it has to do with something related to the jet 
well and aux vent attitude.&nbsp; This picture looks a little funny, like the 
instrument is not resting on the gasket, only because I had to hold the cover 
and tool with one hand while I took the shot.&nbsp; Rest assured that I did it right 
when I put the camera down.&nbsp; The distance you measure is from the gasket face to 
the bottom edge of the float, at the right most edge in this picture.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">Almost done with the cover.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<img src="36IDFrebuild/36idfmed71.jpg" border="0" width="800" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Notice that the stud holes for the air cleaner 
studs are NOT drilled and tapped on these covers.&nbsp; They have to be drilled the 
rest of the way through and tapped for studs.&nbsp; The way the air cleaners attached 
to these in the standard application was by the other two studs, and a larger 
screw that went down into the center cover screw hole.&nbsp; On the end of it there 
was a barrel nut body complementing long studs on the other two holes.&nbsp; Then 
nuts held down the air cleaner on the studs, and a bolt or screw most likely 
threaded into the barrel stud.&nbsp; So now we have to tap the two stud holes, and 
source a larger screw (probably 6mm) for the center cover hole.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">Rather unceremoniously, I will say I drilled and 
tapped them, and here they are tapped and then new studs installed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">With that, they are nearly done, and ready to go.&nbsp; 
I spared you the reassembly - it's the reverse of disassembly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Next we'll fit new throttle plates, bench test and 
check the float levels with fuel in the bowls, and finally leak test, install, 
and road test/tune.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Driving, first impressions: With F11 emulsions, 
and 135 mains and 200 airs as a starting point, the light midrange and WOT were 
quite rich, as well as the idle circuit.&nbsp; I removed the 52 idles and installed
