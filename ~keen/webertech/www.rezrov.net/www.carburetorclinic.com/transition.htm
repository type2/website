<p><font face="Arial" size="5">IDF Transition and you...</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><span class="postbody">Sometimes you can use different main and air jet combinations to get your 
transition straight, and to help with issues related to WFO mixture problems. 
For instance.. suppose you had some problems with weak transition, and you were 
running 11mm floats, and you felt pretty sure that the floats were dead on, and 
that fuel pressure and delivery were behaving.&nbsp; What can you do to make the 
mains come in sooner to meet the idle at the right time?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><span class="postbody">Look down the throat of the 
carb at the auxiliary venturi. There is a tube with a nozzle in it, and there is 
a port that feeds 
the nozzle. The nose end of that port is 
further out at the top, and two things are happening.. one is that the 
difference in pressure of the air flowing down through there (the inherent drop 
due to air acceleration) PLUS the fact that the nose end is further out at the 
top, makes the pressure at the port opening lower as you increase air velocity 
through the carb throat, right? Right. They're designed so that when the 
relative amount of low pressure area around the idle circuit starts to taper 
off, the port is developing enough vacuum under the nose end to start to suck 
emulsified fuel up the well and draw it into the throat of the carb.&nbsp;&nbsp; When 
sufficient vacuum work happens, the emulsified fuel mixture will start to flow 
out of the port and into the throat.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
So what's the deal with the fuel in the well, the emulsion tubes, and the jet 
combinations?&nbsp; I'm not going to go into a lot of detail about different 
emulsion tubes.&nbsp; It suffices to say that the emulsion tube's job is to 
control the supply of fuel in a way that makes sense for what the engine needs 
under different conditions.&nbsp; There are constants, like the throttle plate 
size, the geometry of the carburetor body, etc., and there are variables, each 
of which serves distinct purposes.&nbsp; The variables in question are emulsion 
tubes, float height, and jet sizes.&nbsp; On dual IDFs, F11 is generally the 
solution for gas, other tubes can work better for other fuels.&nbsp; On single 
IDFs, F7 is generally best.&nbsp; On DRLAs, 9146.2 are the popular tube, as it 
does the best for our application.</span></font></p>
<p><span class="postbody"><font face="Arial">Float height is important, period.&nbsp; 
It is important because it sets the height of the fuel in the float bowl, and 
hence in the jet wells.&nbsp; This level is critical for the things that happen 
with the emulsion tubes.&nbsp; They must happen at the right time, and there is 
a narrow window of float heights in which that works best.</font></span></p>
<p><span class="postbody"><font face="Arial">Float height is important as a 
first thing to look at in getting good transition.&nbsp; Don't be fooled into 
thinking that raising the floats will solve all your problems.&nbsp; It might, 
depending on where your floats are currently set.&nbsp; If they are too low, it 
will be weak in transition and there will not be a lot you can do to fix it 
except set the floats right.&nbsp; The correct height for IDFs is 10-11mm and 
the correct height for DRLAs is 5-6mm, in both cases as measured from the cover 
to the furthest edge of the float assembly.</font></span></p>
<p><span class="postbody"><font face="Arial">Too high is a bad thing too.. you 
start to defeat the purposes of the emulsion tubes, may even delay transition, 
or cause a lot of extra fuel spillover.&nbsp; I would never recommend to someone 
that they raise the float level to less than about 9mm.</font></span></p>
<p>How does transition actually start?&nbsp; Being familiar with the anatomy of 
IDF or DRLA carbs helps with understanding this.&nbsp; You have an idle circuit 
that is comprised of a mixture screw port, and a set of progression ports along 
the wall of the barrel.&nbsp; They are all exposed by the time you have pressed 
the gas pedal a small fraction of it's total travel.&nbsp; This gives you a 
smooth low speed operation and happens while the throttle is open enough to rush 
air past the progression ports, causing an amount of fuel to be delivered to the 
engine.&nbsp; The idle jet size determines this mixture strength once you crack 
the throttle, until the point that you have exposed all the progression ports.&nbsp; </p>
<p>By the time you have exposed all the ports, you have reached a throttle 
position that is open enough that two things are starting to occur:</p>
<p>1. When the throttle plates are just opening.. the majority of the air 
flowing past them is passing by the walls of the cylinder.&nbsp; The first 
progression port is exposed in a situation where a lot of air is flowing right 
by the progression hole, and the resulting turbulence pulls fuel from the ports.&nbsp; 
The more you open the throttle, the more ports are exposed, BUT, at these 
angles, more and more of the air is passing far away from the port holes.&nbsp; 
This means that more air is now doing less work to the progression ports to pull 
fuel out.&nbsp; Somewhere in this effect, you will no longer be able to support 
the needed air-fuel mixture on the idle circuits, so you need to get more fuel 
some other way. </p>
<p>2. As the plates open more and more, you increase the airflow through the 
carburetor, and the increased rate of airflow eventually reaches a point that it 
does substantial work on the venturi.&nbsp; The venturi is basically a mild 
restrictor, and the result is that as air is pulled down with a specific amount 
of force, the air will be accelerated through the venturi. As this happens, the 
pressure of the air develops a gradient along the length of the venturi.. such 
that there is the relative high pressure region (above the venturi) and a 
relative low pressure region (typically somewhere right under (downstream of) 
the minimum diameter region of the venturi.&nbsp; Note the height position of 
the auxiliary venturi tube.&nbsp; The top of it is above any region that would 
have a venturi effect, and the bottom edge of it is close the the minimum 
diameter region of the venturi.&nbsp; The auxiliary venturi experiences a net 
flow of air through it, as a result of the inside of the tube being isolated 
from the area where the pressure gradient is changing the most.&nbsp; The 
pressure difference in turn pulls a suction on the port in the auxiliary 
venturi, sucking fuel out.</p>
<p>What we hope for is that the main circuit is there to cover the area where 
the idle circuits are starting to taper off in effectiveness.</p>
<p><font face="Arial"><span class="postbody">If you pull out a jet stack and 
shine a light down the hole (i.e. the fuel wells), you will see gas in there.&nbsp; 
If the float bowl is full, that fuel should be about 4mm below the port in the 
jet well that leads out to the auxiliary venturi. That gas is at the same height 
as the gas that is sitting in the float bowl.&nbsp; It takes a certain amount of 
work to draw the fuel from it's resting level in the well to the height of the 
aux vent port.&nbsp; No matter what main jets you have in there within reason, 
the air jets, vent size, engine speed and the throttle position largely control 
when the main circuit wants to come on, for a given float height.&nbsp; </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><span class="postbody">The air jets, main jets, and emulsion tubes form 
a system that introduces air 
into the fuel in the jet well.&nbsp; Liquids have a surface tension property, 
and one of the effects that can be observed is one that causes the liquid to 
attach and pull itself up along the walls of a container.&nbsp; If you've ever 
put water in a test tube and read the quantity of the liquid by way of the 
meniscus, you know that the liquid does not sit level in the tube.&nbsp; This is 
also true in the jet wells.&nbsp; But the introduction of an inner tube inside 
the jet well (emulsion tube) can make the fuel leech up between the emulsion 
tube and the jet well by about 2mm or so.&nbsp; The fuel that is resting in this 
area is pretty resistant to going anywhere due to the same surface tension that 
has drawn it up into the area.&nbsp; But it's closer to the aux vent port when 
the tube is in there, and so half the work is done.&nbsp; The other half of the 
work has be be done ON the fuel, by the auxiliary venturi's inlet port.</span></font></p>
<p><span class="postbody"><font face="Arial">Since the fuel is resistant to 
being pulled up any higher than the surface tension has affected, we have to do 
something that will &quot;mobilize&quot; the fuel.&nbsp; The early action of the auxiliary 
venturi's inlet port isn't enough to physically do the work on the fuel that is 
necessary to pull it up the well and into the port.</font></span></p>
<p><span class="postbody"><font face="Arial">AHA!&nbsp; Well, news flash...the 
fuel is mobilized by way of the air jet and holes in the emulsion tube.&nbsp; 
The air drawn down through the jet stacks, into the emulsion tubes is used as a 
control to mobilize and to put on the brakes for fuel consumption through the 
full range of the main circuit.&nbsp; The AIR jet size affects how easily and 
how much air is fed to the emulsion tube.</font></span></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><span class="postbody">When the fuel mixture STARTS flowing at low velocity (when the main circuit is 
just kicking in) the amount of flow through the main jet does not really depend 
a whole lot on the size of the jet.. but as there is a higher flow demand, it 
does matter. As the flow rate goes up, relieving pressure difference (fighting for 
equilibrium) in the port becomes a contribution between the air jet and the fuel 
jet. Their sizes RELATIVE to each other will start to matter more as the flow 
increases. But when the mains JUST start to kick in, the amount of vacuum seen 
at the port is the same, no matter what jets you have in there, until flow 
increases and the dynamics of that duo of jets really starts working. <br>
<br>
</span></font><span class="postbody"><font face="Arial">The fuel level in the well, in 
conjunction with what emulsion tubes you use, will control transition.&nbsp; If you 
are having problems getting transition to happen correctly, you can tune it out 
by changing the air jets until the transition starts to smooth out.&nbsp; Then you 
can adjust your mains to keep the right mixture on higher RPM.</font></span></p>
<p><span class="postbody"><font face="Arial">In order to bring the mains in 
sooner you need a LARGER air jet.&nbsp; Seems sort of backwards doesn't it? Well I 
learned my lesson on this the hard way.&nbsp; Why does it work this way instead of 
sucking more fuel when you reduce the air jet?&nbsp; Because the fuel that is 
reaching the inlet to the secondary venturi is fuel that has been introduced 
into the two phase flow (emulsified).&nbsp; The larger air jet pulls air down into 
the fuel well easier and so it takes less to emulsify the fuel, break the 
surface tension, and pull it into the&nbsp; inlet.&nbsp; Prove it to yourself.&nbsp; Put 
smaller air jets in there and watch your transition get weak.&nbsp; Put larger ones 
in and watch it smooth out.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
<p><span class="postbody"><font face="Arial">What you want is the smallest air 
jet that will allow you to get transition with no dead spot.&nbsp; It's more of a 
struggle with larger venturis due to net airflow through the 4.5mm aux vent 
compared to the amount of air that goes through the whole main venturi.&nbsp; With 
larger vents and especially with larger butterflies, you will start to move 
enough air, far enough away from the progression ports, that the idle circuit 
will die out before a lot of velocity and vacuum reaches the aux vent horn, so 
you need to make it more sensitive.&nbsp; With larger air jets, you can do that.</font></span></p>
<p><span class="postbody"><font face="Arial">There is a point at which an 
emulsion tube swap starts to make sense too.&nbsp; With a 40 vent on a 48 IDF, it's a 
good time to put in an F2 emulsion tube in place of an F11.&nbsp; With the F2, your 
mains and airs will be a little smaller to get similar effects.</font></span></p>
<p><span class="postbody"><font face="Arial">Differences in emulsion tubes will 
be discussed more as I have time to write about them.&nbsp; They don't seem to be 
widely discussed in books, and the diagrams require some understanding about 
what's happening to interpret.&nbsp; Even a lot of Weber gurus don't bother trying to 
understand the dynamics.. just knowing when to change to a different one 
depending on what's going on seems sufficient for most of us.</font></span></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><span class="postbody">The other thing you can do to help 
is raise the float levels but only do it a millimeter at a time, or even less. 
You want the floats about as close to 11mm area as you can get them and still 
have good transition.&nbsp; As the float levels increase, the distance from the fuel 
to the aux vent port will decrease, and less work will be required to get it up 
and out the port.&nbsp; This means transition can come earlier.&nbsp; But there is a limit 
and that limit is dependent on tolerances and carburetor application.&nbsp; A lot of 
buggy guys keep the floats lower to keep slosh down, and just run fat ass idle 
jets and main jets.&nbsp; Some just deal with lean transition as a result, and some 
deal with some richness under certain conditions. </span></font></p>
<p><span class="postbody"><font face="Arial">So you have a few things at your 
disposal to do your tuning.. the problem here is that now that you have the idea 
you need a way to read your results.&nbsp; Save the pennies and get a wideband 
air-fuel meter.&nbsp; It's worth it.&nbsp; </font></span><font face="Arial">
<span class="postbody">&nbsp;Once you have it there is no looking back.&nbsp; You'll have 
your carb tops off so many times your hardware will all shine like new.&nbsp; You'll 
have your jet stacks out so many times you can do a jet change in 2 minutes or 
less.&nbsp; It's annoying but at the same time, fun.</span></font></p>
