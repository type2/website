<p><b><font size="5" face="Arial">Installing the Scat Solex 35PDSIT dual 1 bbl carb kit</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I wrote this page up as help to those installing the kit.&nbsp; 
The things I figured out about installing it my help others.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Note:&nbsp; There are a lot of problems with this kit, in 
terms of fitment.&nbsp; Not just one, but several.&nbsp; If those problems do 
not exist, it's a solid carb setup.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="35pdsit/35pdsit01.jpg" width="640" height="322"></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I started out with a set of Weber 36 IDFs and wanted to get 
rid of the carburetors I had, so I purchased a set of Scat Solex 35PDSIT carbs, a 
product sold by Scat and its resellers.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="35pdsit/35pdsit02.jpg" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">First things first.&nbsp; Disconnecting the linkage from the 
carburetor throttle arms, disconnecting the fuel line, and removing the manifold 
nuts allows me to pull out the carburetor, intake, and air cleaner all at once.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="35pdsit/35pdsit03.jpg" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Picture of the 3/4 side with the carburetor and manifold 
removed.&nbsp; I took the opportunity to change the spark plugs while I was at 
it.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="35pdsit/35pdsit04.jpg" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">This is the 1/2 side with the carb and manifold removed as 
well.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="35pdsit/35pdsit05.jpg" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">At this point, I moved my coil from the center mount spot back 
to the shroud, and started to install the centerpull linkage base.&nbsp; In 
order to do it, you either need a longer stud, or you have to use the supplied 
bolt.&nbsp; Here you can see me removing the stud from the case, preparing to 
install the base and the bolt. I just double nutted the stud and pulled it out.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="35pdsit/35pdsit06.jpg" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Now, the base is supposed to sit against the case stud boss, 
and if you look at the bolt they supplied, it's too long, so I will have to 
add a washer to it.&nbsp; I happen to have a few thick head stud washers around, 
so I used one to space the bolt a little.&nbsp; Depending on your engine case, 
this may not be an issue, but watch for it.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="35pdsit/35pdsit07.jpg" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The base is supposed to be secured using the bolt AND this 
bracket which goes to the lower left alternator backing plate hole.&nbsp; Since 
the bracket wouldn't line up correctly with the base right against the case 
boss, I moved my extra washer in between the base and the case stud boss.&nbsp; 
Now the bracket lines up with the hole pretty well, BUT to get the base to be correct and vertical the bracket sits away from the 
backing plate.&nbsp; As you can see from my wrench slipped behind the bracket, 
there is substantial space to be taken up.&nbsp; The use of a 13/8mm nut between 
the backing plate and the bracket got things very close to vertical.&nbsp; 
Again, this may depend on your application and is an easy fix.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="35pdsit/35pdsit08.jpg" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">After all parts were in place, I secured the bracket using the 
supplied allen head bolt (fortunately it was long enough) to the backing plate, 
and then tightened up the bolts.&nbsp; It came out pretty straight.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="35pdsit/35pdsit09.jpg" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">After installing the center base, I installed the 
carburetors to the intakes and then installed the 1/2 side first.&nbsp; It's 
easier if you install the carbs to the intakes, and then the entire assembly to 
the engine.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="35pdsit/35pdsit10.jpg" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Using a universal and an 11mm socket, I tightened the manifold 
down.&nbsp; Note that Scat supplied steel 11mm nuts but I like brass ones 
better.&nbsp; They don't freeze on or rust.&nbsp; There were some linkage 
interference issues that took me almost an hour to work out with some handyness 
built into the Harney blood.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="35pdsit/35pdsit13.jpg" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Now to the right side.&nbsp; The  
carburetor wanted to foul the shroud.&nbsp; After some struggle, I gave up on clearing the shroud for it, and 
had to do some machine work to get it to clear.&nbsp; Apparently Scat has no 
intention of having you install this kit on an OEM shroud!&nbsp; Know why?&nbsp; 
They don't sell OEMs, they sell their cheap ass 36 HP shroud which is no real 
problem.&nbsp; Their solution would be to replace your CORRECT shroud with a 
Scat 36 HP shroud.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Now it clears, but another hour wasted.&nbsp; This is taking 
me a LOT more time that it should have.&nbsp; I should have been done by now.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="35pdsit/35pdsit15.jpg" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">With the carburetors installed I finished installing the 
linkage, and added a return spring by using an old spring from a stock PICT 
carburetor and drilling a 1/8&quot; hole in the alternator ring to attach it.&nbsp; 
It's a good thing I had something, because guess what?&nbsp; Its not included in 
the kit.&nbsp; They assume you won't need any additional return 
springs.&nbsp; Silly them.&nbsp; This one's strong enough to make sure the 
linkage returns without requiring He-Man to press the gas pedal.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="35pdsit/35pdsit16.jpg" width="640" height="480"></font></p>



<p><font face="Arial">When installing the linkage, the 1/2 rod wanted to foul on the 
bottom of the generator strap.&nbsp; Go figure.&nbsp; Keeps getting better with 
these guys.&nbsp; 
No big deal though.&nbsp; Intially I had the supplied washer for the linkage 
hinge stud between the linkage and the base.&nbsp; I moved it above the linkage 
and you can see it on the other picture above now between the nylock nut and the 
linkage center (positioned just above that return spring I added). That gave me 
a gnat's ass worth of space between the linkage rod and the generator strap.&nbsp; 
Any more and I would have had to either modify the base, to lower it, or mill a 
little off the linkage center piece to drop it down some.&nbsp; Whew.</font></p>



<p><font face="Arial">In retrospect, this might have been my fault.&nbsp; But it's 
not like the instructions were clear or anything.

<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="35pdsit/35pdsit14.jpg" width="640" height="273"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">After moving my coil back into place, reconnecting all my 
wiring, and making some other little changes, including adding a pressure 
regulator, I have it all together, and ready to start up.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Note on regulators: See the one I have on there (dial type)?&nbsp; 
That is the perfect example of what NOT to get.&nbsp; But you should use one 
with any electric pump and these carbs.&nbsp; They do not like too much 
pressure.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">With a mechanical fuel pump, you can just buy gaskets and 
stack them as spacers until you get the right pressure.&nbsp; No need to use a 
regulator on a mechanical fuel pump.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial">Tuning</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Well, now.. here we are.. all bolted up and ready to go.&nbsp; 
I even have a cheap little pressure regulator.&nbsp; Yeah, yeah, I know.. I 
replaced it with a good one later.&nbsp; It worked for the time being... well, 
sort of.&nbsp; They function more like restrictors than regulators, which in the 
full range of operation renders them pretty worthless.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">These carbs need a low fuel pressure.. about 2 lbs is 
recommended.&nbsp; I had previously bought a Carter rotary pump that regulates 
at 3.5 lbs of pressure, but that's too much.&nbsp; At 2 lbs, I was overflowing 
fuel like mad.&nbsp; I ended at about 1 psi, with no starvation problems, AFTER 
I did some mods to the carbs to get the floats to stop sticking!&nbsp; Sheesh.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Note: I've been asked on a few occasions to 
provide instructions on tuning these carbs, and really it's no different from 
tuning IDFs or other dual carbs, except you only have one barrel per side to 
deal with.&nbsp; The use of a balance tube will require that you pinch off the 
tube to set the flows. The idle speed will rise, but you just need to even the 
flows and then release the tube, set the mixtures, and then pinch the tube to 
re-check the flows and raise/drop them if necessary to get the speed about right 
when you release the tube. The flows must be set with a good flow meter like a 
snail synchrometer.&nbsp; They MUST be equal, and around 7-9 KG/hr is about the 
norm, per side.&nbsp; If you don't have a way to balance the flows, you will not 
get it right, and you will be frustrated.&nbsp; Get the snail, pinch the tube if 
you have one installed, set the flows, release the tube, and then set the 
mixtures to lean best idle.&nbsp; Then go back to the flows, and start over and 
you will be close to where you need it after tuning the mixtures for the last 
time.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Once those are all set, then adjust your linkage 
when the engine is warm to get it to fit the throttle arms as they are 
positioned, and so that they actuate both arms at the same time.&nbsp; This 
should ensure smooth throttle action, and the balance tube setup can help the 
lower RPM ranges quite a bit.. more on that down the article.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial">Initial tuning</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial">First things first.&nbsp; We must pre-set the carbs.&nbsp; Now 
I got these carbs out of the box and saw that the idle speed screws had paint on 
them, and assumed that meant someone had pre-set them to something acceptable.&nbsp; 
So happily I set the idle mix screws to the recommended 1-1/4 turns out, set the 
pressure regulator, turned on the ignition to let the pump do its job (nice 
thing about electric pumps.. they fill the bowls for you).&nbsp; I noticed that 
at 2 lbs setting on the regulator, the fuel wasn't filling the carbs up, and I 
couldn't get any squirt from the accelerator pumps.&nbsp; So I turned the 
regulator up another &quot;half pound&quot;.&nbsp; That did it and I could now after a few 
pumps get some gas out of the accelerator pump nozzles.&nbsp; With the linkage 
set up and all else ready, I cranked it and it started right away, no problem.&nbsp; 
It ran rough, as expected, but I got it warmed up and it smoothed out a little 
once the circuits were fully charged with fuel.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">After warmup, I started to try to adjust things out.&nbsp; The 
idle was high, like 1200 RPM, and the mixture screws needed to be turned a lot 
to get any kind of response either way.&nbsp; This seemed wierd to me, but I 
didn't pursue it too much.&nbsp; I just tuned it close and started out with high 
idle.&nbsp; There should be NO vacuum advance at idle, but the vacuum line was pulling a vacuum even at idle, so rather 
than mess with that for now, I wanted to drive it, so I disconnected the vacuum 
line and took it for a drive.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The response was a little weak with the vacuum line 
disconnected, and my timing was set at about 8 and 28 or so with my old SVDA.&nbsp; 
Cool for now.&nbsp; Around the block I went.&nbsp; I got about half way around 
the block and the right side carb went dry.&nbsp; I could see the head temps 
going up as the left side started to labor to keep the engine pulling the bus, 
and so I limped it home, rapidly moving to about 350 degrees.&nbsp; I pulled up 
in the drive and figured that crappy regulator was causing the trouble.&nbsp; 
After turning the knob another &quot;half pound&quot; (LOL) that was solved and no 
spillover at idle.&nbsp; I'm thinking a new regulator (a REAL one) is in order 
quickly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Around the block I went again, again waving at all the 
neighbors that see me do this sometimes, and watched my air fuel meter show 
about 11-12:1 AFR, which is WAY rich.&nbsp; So now I have got 55 idle jets 
coming.&nbsp; They should get me closer to 13-14:1.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The mains are still a mystery, and will be, until I get the 
idle circuit finished, so I know exactly what I am looking at for transition and 
such.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial">Vacuum Advance</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Now it was time to tackle the vacuum signal.&nbsp; There 
should be no vacuum in the vacuum advance line at idle.&nbsp; I figured that 
maybe these advance ports were a little aggressive, and that maybe 
they were designed to run a distributor with a vacuum can and no advance.&nbsp; I 
called Scat (pity you that have already tried this) and got the secretary, 
then Ron, then Tommy, who was apparently the guy in the barrel today, who never 
answered his phone and I got dumped to voice mail. I left a message in hopes of 
getting a call back.&nbsp; Nothing like that happened, so I played a little more 
and decided I would try to get the throttle plates closed as much as possible 
and see what happened.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Remember the part where I said that the white paint on the 
idle speed screws made me think that they were pre-set?&nbsp; Well, I got news 
for you.&nbsp; They weren't even CLOSE.&nbsp; I ended up backing the ALL the way 
out until the screws no longer touched the stops, and going back in about a 
turn.&nbsp; By the way, for any of you with a full OEM doghouse shroud, another 
annoyance about these carbs is that you cannot adjust the idle speed screw on 
the 1/2 side unless you open the throttle about 1/3 and use a screwdriver (a 
short one) to adjust it, so forget doing it while the engine is running.&nbsp; 
No big deal.&nbsp; 
Once I got it set for about a turn in or so on each side, I started it and it 
was RICH as hell.&nbsp; Good sign.&nbsp; So I readjusted the mixture screws 
which were MUCH more responsive now, and got my idle AFR about 13, and my idle 
set to about 800 RPM.&nbsp; Lo and behold, there was no vacuum signal at idle.&nbsp; Yay.&nbsp; At some point during all this mess, actually first thing this 
morning, I installed my new SVDA distributor from Aircooled.net after moving my Compufire over to it, and 
got it timed and such, to about 10 degrees at idle, and 30 degrees full advance.&nbsp; 
Now with my vacuum advance connected, the idle timing stayed at 10, which again 
is a good sign.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">So, with vacuum advance set to initial settings, I took it for 
a test drive and WOW what a difference, like night and day.&nbsp; Lots of power 
and lots of response.&nbsp; These carbs really lend themselves to vacuum 
advance.&nbsp; Both have ports, but I only have one of them connected and it is 
killer.</font></p>



<p><font face="Arial">To re-cap: out of the box, they were adjusted too high on the 
idle screws.&nbsp; The way they were set up, they were into the progression 
ports, and if you look at these carbs, they have a couple vacuum ports too, so 
that also figured into the problem.&nbsp; Backing them out until I got a 
decently low idle was the solution.</font></p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><b><font face="Arial">Idle</font></b></p>



<p><font face="Arial">The funky thing about using these carbs on these engines is 
that the engine idles on only two cylinders, for the most part.&nbsp; These 
engines fire sequentially on each bank (2, then 1, and then 4, then 3).&nbsp; 
While I have talked to people about this the only thing I have really gleaned is 
that it's normal for this to happen, but exactly WHAT is happening is still a 
tough one for me.&nbsp; There's no real solution to it from a tuning standpoint, 
so it is what it is.. but it's funny to watch my #1 and #3 cylinders drop to 
about 200 degrees at idle.&nbsp; This requires more thought, in the direction of 
vacuum pulses and fuel delay, for me to reconcile it completely.&nbsp; I mean, 
both are getting a vacuum signal, and the only thing I can come up with that 
makes sense is a situation where, say, #4 pulls, and gets fuel, and the flux in 
air speed at the shared intake plenum causes a delay of fuel, and the fuel makes 
it out to the intake, but gets pulled by #4 the next time.&nbsp; By the time #3 
pulls air, #4 has already gotten the fuel charge, and all that is left is a 
vacuum while the carburetors idle circuit tries to catch up and shoot fuel to 
the intake.</font></p>



<p><font face="Arial">But it doesn't matter, because without a fancy solution, this 
can't really be fixed.&nbsp; That's the way it is.&nbsp; For any of you that 
have this kind of setup (dual 1bbl carbs) try pulling your #1 or #3 plug wire 
and your idle will stay the same.&nbsp; Now pull a #2 or #4 and you will notice 
a BIG change.&nbsp; That'll prove it to you.&nbsp; Adding a balance tube will 
help, but it won't completely solve it unless you use a big one, and that has 
some problems associated with it as well.</font></p>



<p><font face="Arial">But beyond idle, once you give it a little gas, it cleans up 
nicely, and takes off.&nbsp; So with that in mind, idle is no big deal.&nbsp; 
Consider it an economy boost at idle.</font></p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><b><font face="Arial">Editorial</font></b></p>



<p><font face="Arial">The kit as Scat supplies it can be a giant pain in the ass.&nbsp; 
It wouldn't be so bad if:</font></p>



<p><font face="Arial">1. they returned calls<br>
2. they offered what they said they did in terms of vents and such<br>
3. they didn't jet the carbs for Death Valley!<br>
4. they gave good instructions, instead of &quot;how great these are&quot; </font></p>



<p><font face="Arial">The technology used is great.&nbsp; These are quite linearized 
carbs, and tune EASILY.&nbsp; The linkage leaves some to be desired.&nbsp; 
Push/Pull linkage is subject to synch variations due to expansion.&nbsp; This 
could be improved on and I intend to do just that and update the article when I 
do.&nbsp; I'm a linkage nazi.&nbsp; Most linkage needs some improvement IMO.</font></p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><b><font face="Arial">The good news:</font></b></p>



<p><font face="Arial"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.aircooled.net">
AIRCOOLED.NET</a> offers 
their own version of the kit from Scat.&nbsp; They make all the modifications to 
make it fit correctly, now that they know what kind of things are problematic.&nbsp; 
They jet for you too.&nbsp; If you look at their
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.aircooled.net/new-bin/viewproductdetail.php?keyword2=FSK0060">product listing</a>, you can get them jetted the way you need it.&nbsp; They 
have an excellent jetting program and will make sure you have the right ones.&nbsp; 
What took me 5 freaking hours to do should have taken a LOT less, like maybe two 
hours.&nbsp; Aircooled.net's kit should be a much easier kit to deal with and 
issues (if any) should be minimal.&nbsp; You will have to adjust them still, as 
they cannot do it for you.&nbsp; Each engine requires its own adjustment, so you 
will have to set the throttle positions, synch the carbs up, adjust the idle 
mixtures, and then adjust the linkage, no matter what.&nbsp; In fact, you will 
have to run through it a couple times no matter where you get them.&nbsp; NO ONE 
can do it until it goes on your engine.&nbsp; The jetting you get from 
Aircooled.net will be right, you will just have to do the tweaks when you bolt 
them on.&nbsp; In the past, I've seen that Aircooled.net also takes customer 
feedback into consideration, which you won't find to be true with about anyone 
else.&nbsp; So given the history of these kits, they've done their homework on 
the problems with them.&nbsp; In other words, when they when ACN finds out about a problem 
previously unknown, they do what they can to reconcile it for future customers.</font></p>



<p><font face="Arial">I hope this article helps you - it sure made ME feel better.&nbsp; 
What could have been a great kit requires a lot of engineering and at least one 
company now does something about it.</font></p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><b><font face="Arial">Updates (in order)</font></b></p>



<p><font face="Arial">* I got the 55 idles installed and it runs better, and gets 
better air-fuel numbers.&nbsp; The numbers are closer to 14:1 AFR until you give 
it any amount of gas, and under load, it's rich.&nbsp; The 150 mains are too 
big.</font></p>



<p><font face="Arial">* I got some 140 and 145 mains and installed the 140s, which 
were a little leaner, showing me the upper end of the 14's range on the main 
circuit.&nbsp; I got the 145's in there and it was at 13.5 most of the 
time.&nbsp;&nbsp; A 147-ish would have been the option for power, but the 
limitation here is really the vents.</font></p>



<p><font face="Arial">* The supplied 27mm vents are a little small for my engine.&nbsp; 
They have now been replaced with some billet 30mm vents from Aircooled.net.&nbsp; 
You can get them
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.aircooled.net/new-bin/viewproductdetail.php?keyword2=FSK0062&cartid=0417200695815326">here</a>.&nbsp; The vents made a big difference in the performance of these 
carbs, and even with jetting adjustments (went to 160 mains) to get the same 
AFRs, I noticed a drop in cylinder head temps!&nbsp; The head temps under load 
dropped almost 25 degrees across the board!</font></p>



<p><font face="Arial">* Jetting - with the 30 vents, so far what's 
worked out best for me is 55 idle, 157 main (made some.. they're not available 
in that size), and 110 air jets.&nbsp; These air jets work differently from IDF 
carbs, so don't go over there and read that and think you are going to tune 
these with the same thinking.&nbsp; Also, accelerator pumps have been backed WAY 
off.&nbsp; They squirt tons of gas out the way they come out of the box.&nbsp; I 
have watched my air-fuel meter jump down to the 10's for a second or longer with 
them adjusted the way they come.&nbsp; Sheesh.</font></p>



<p><font face="Arial">* I installed a balance tube.&nbsp; It did make 
some difference, less rough idle and low speed operation.&nbsp; Mileage went up 
too.&nbsp; </font></p>



<p><font face="Arial">* Current mileage as of 9/3/06 - about 25 mpg!</font></p>



<p><font face="Arial">* A note about air-fuel ratios.. I got away from 
these carbs and sold them before I got into lean AFR tuning.&nbsp; I can tell 
you that tuning on the leaner side of stoich (higher than 14.7) can have 
benefits in temp and economy if you can tune it right.&nbsp; Don't assume that 
you can't go leaner than 14's AFR.&nbsp; You can tune into the 15's and 16's.&nbsp; 
It's a matter of getting it to remain in those numbers and not spike leaner 
much.&nbsp; I run 15's and 16's consistently on my bus with other carbs, and I 
get great mileage and low head temps.</font></p>



<p><font face="Arial">02/??/07 The carbs have been sold off with all the 
extras.&nbsp; Here are additional pictures of how I installed the balance tubes.</font></p>
