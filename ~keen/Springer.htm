document.write("JERRY: Tonight on the Jerry Springer show we have a particularly interesting episode! "+name+" is here to finally confess something to a long-time friend of his "+friend+". So everyone please put your hands together for "+name+"!<BR>");
document.write("Jerry: Okay, now "+name+" you're here to talk about someone aren't you?<BR>");
document.write("You: Yes.<BR>");
document.write("Jerry: And what is this other persons name?<BR>");
document.write("You: "+ofriend+".<BR>");
document.write("The crowd SQUEALS with delight.<BR>");
document.write("Jerry: Okay, okay, well "+ofriend+", is actually here tonight -<BR>");
document.write("The crowd SQUEALS.<BR>");
document.write("Jerry: But first we have a surprise for you "+name+", because as it happens there is someone else here to see YOU! So let's bring out... "+enemy+"!<BR>");
document.write("You: What the HELL!!!<BR>");
document.write("Out of nowhere you pull out a "+weapon+". "+enemy+" reaches for the "+furniture+". Out of the shadows "+ofriend2+" appears.<BR>");
document.write(ofriend2+": Wait everybody wait!<BR>");
document.write("Jerry: Yes, everybody let's just calm down for a moment here. First tell us why you're here "+enemy+".<BR>");
document.write(enemy+": Because I saw "+name+" and "+ofriend2+" making out at "+place+"!<BR>");
document.write("The crowd goes absolutely INSANE.<BR>");
document.write(ofriend2+": That's a lie! I was home watching "+tvshow+"!<BR>");
document.write("Jerry: (raising his hands) Hold on, hold on, I'm missing the problem here...what exactly IS the problem "+enemy+"?<BR>");
document.write(enemy+": Because I've recently been taking part in a sexual relationship with "+friend+" who has recently become engaged to "+ofriend2+".<BR>");
document.write("The crowd hollers, screams and whoops in an orchestra of orgasmic excitement.<BR>");
document.write("Jerry: Okay, okay. Well why don't we bring "+friend+" out here because "+name+" had something that they needed to tell them anyway about... "+ofriend+" that's right!<BR>");
document.write(friend+": (enters onto stage and saunters over towards you) What's the deal? I saw you outside getting it on with "+ofriend+"! You know I'm how I feel about "+ofriend+"!.<BR>");
document.write(ofriend2+": (screams) What? Why the hell did you ask me to marry you if you're in love with "+ofriend+"!<BR>");
document.write(friend+": Because I knew that I could never have "+ofriend+". But "+name+" promised me that they'd never hook up out of respect for my feelings!<BR>");
document.write(ofriend2+": What about respect for MY feelings!<BR>");
document.write(enemy+" walks suddenly across the stage, embracing "+friend+".<BR>");
document.write(enemy+": Don't worry baby, you don't need any of them now that you have me.<BR>");
document.write("Again the crowd SQUEALS.<BR>");
document.write(ofriend2+": Oh my God! Are you SICK!<BR>");
document.write(ofriend2+" runs across the room and wraps their arms around you tightly.<BR>");
document.write(ofriend2+": "+name+" take me away from all of this!<BR>");
document.write("You: You see? That's the thing...I'm...well, I'm married...<BR>");
document.write("The crowd does its bit.<BR>");
document.write(ofriend2+": Married?<BR>");
document.write("You nod.<BR>");
document.write(ofriend2+": Who the hell are you married to? When...when did this happen? I don't understand!<BR>");
document.write("You: The other day. In Vegas. I'm married to "+ofriend+".<BR>");
document.write(friend+": (screaming) WHAT!!!<BR>");
document.write("Jerry: (grinning widely, makes an enquiry) So...did you have a nice wedding night?<BR>");
document.write(ofriend+": (stepping back out onto center stage) Well we had sex "+number+" times if that's what you mean.<BR>");
document.write("The crowd squeals.<BR>");
document.write("Jerry: Okay, okay. So let me get this all straight... "+name+" is married to "+ofriend+" who "+friend+" has secretly been in love with for years and years. Now "+friend+" has recently become engaged to "+ofriend2+" who was recently spotted kissing "+name+" in the "+place+". Now on top of this "+enemy+" has just admitted to being in a sexual relationship with "+friend+".<BR>");
document.write(ofriend+": That's right Jerry.<BR>");
document.write("Jerry: (looking sternly into the camera) It is times like these that one has to wonder, whether or not these people are aware that they are quite clinically insane. Perhaps we should be spending more on psychiatric health funds in this country, perhaps we should just ban Vegas to cut down on impulse marriages. Perhaps I should get a new job. Thanks for watching folks it's been great but for now...it's goodnight.<BR>");
document.write("Queue cheesy background music and fade to black.");
