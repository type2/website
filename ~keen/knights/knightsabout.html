Another is to try and	head off the computer knight so that it will be left without anywhere to go.	The computer does a little of each and plays a decent game.</p><p align="center">	<a href="knights.html">Click Here to Play On-line</a></p><p>	Once the game is loaded, you simply point and click on the board to move.	After the game ends, click the red button to play again.</p><p>	<cite>Knights' Tourney</cite> requires version 5 of Macromedia's Flash Player.	If you don't have the plug-in,	you can <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash">download it for free</a>.</p><h2>About this Game</h2><p>	The <cite>Knight's Tour</cite> is a classic logic puzzle in the form of	a chess problem: Is it possible for a chess knight to move through every	square on the board without revisiting any? The answer for the usual 8x8	chess board is yes, but the general question for arbitrary board sizes has	interested mathematicians working in the area of graph theory. See, for instance,	<a href="http://www.markkeen.com/knight.html">Mark Keen's paper</a> on the subject.	There are several on-line implementations of the original problem.</p><p>	<cite>Knights' Tourney</cite> is a two-player generalization of the <cite>Knight's Tour</cite> which	has been suggested by enough people that it's hard to name one inventor.	This implementation of it is &copy;2001 by P.D. Magnus.</p><p>	The title font is <cite>Piracy</cite> by Jakob Fischer.
