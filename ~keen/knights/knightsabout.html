<p>a strategy game for you and your computer</p>

<h2>Take the Challenge</h2>
<p>
	A chess board is set with two knights: one black, one white.
	Yours is the white knight and you take the first move.
	You alternate turns with the computer,
	but you lose if it's your turn and you can't move.
	Sounds easy, right?
</p>
<p>
	The pieces move just like knights in ordinary chess, but the trick is that
	squares disappear from the board when pieces pass through them.
	Once you've been to a square, neither you nor the computer can go there again.
</p>
<p>
	One strategy is to try and stay free so that you'll never
	be caught without a possible move. Another is to try and
	head off the computer knight so that it will be left without anywhere to go.
	The computer does a little of each and plays a decent game.

<h2>About this Game</h2>
<p>
	The <cite>Knight's Tour</cite> is a classic logic puzzle in the form of
	a chess problem: Is it possible for a chess knight to move through every
	square on the board without revisiting any? The answer for the usual 8x8
	chess board is yes, but the general question for arbitrary board sizes has
	interested mathematicians working in the area of graph theory. See, for instance,
	<a href="http://www.markkeen.com/knight.html">Mark Keen's paper</a> on the subject.
	There are several on-line implementations of the original problem.
</p>
<p>
	<cite>Knights' Tourney</cite> is a two-player generalization of the <cite>Knight's Tour</cite> which
	has been suggested by enough people that it's hard to name one inventor.
	This implementation of it is &copy;2001 by P.D. Magnus.
