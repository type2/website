<P><A HREF="vwradios051112.html">VW Radio List</A><BR>
This radio list was originally made by Scott Fraser and the site it originally appeared on is no longer operational.  I have copied the html, revised it and made several additions and corrections on November 12, 2005.  At that time, I tried to contact Scott Fraser and provide him with the updated html for his site, but never received any reply.  Because the original site is no longer operational, I have decided to host this page on the Old Volks Home site so that it can continue to be a source of valuable information.
<P><A HREF="hardstart.pdf">Starter Troubleshooting</A><BR>A brief, but thorough trouble shooting guide for Volkswagen Starters.  Applies to most models and includes a diagram to wire up a Hard Start Relay.<BR>Note:  This is an Adobe PDF File (2 pages).  To view this requires Adobe Acrobat Reader.  If you don't have Adobe Acrobat Reader, it can be downloaded from the Adobe Website for FREE.  Download Acrobat Reader first, install it, then return to this site to view this and other PDF Files.<BR><A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep.html">Click Here to download Adobe Acrobat Reader</A>.
<P><A HREF="headlight_switch_OVH.pdf">Headlight Switch Wiring Diagram</A><BR>I frequently get inquiries about how a particular model's Headlight Switch is supposed to be wired.  This 14 page PDF (Adobe Acrobat Reader required) shows how to properly wire your Headlight Switch for 58-77 Standard Beetles, 71-72 Super Beetles, 3/55-79 Type 2s and 66-73 Type 3s.  More models to be added soon, so please check back.
<P><A HREF="ovh_68-71_turn-hazard_wiring.pdf">Turn Signal-Hazard Switch Wiring Diagram</A><BR>Another frequently asked inquiry is about how a Turn Signal Switch is supposed to be wired.  This updated PDF (Adobe Acrobat Reader required) shows how to properly wire your Turn Signal and Hazard Switch for Late 68-71 Beetles & Karmann Ghias.
<P><A HREF="headrelay.pdf">Headlight Dimmer Relay Diagram</A><BR>The replacement Headlight Relay you buy these days may or may not match what was originally installed in your Volkswagen.  Terminal Numbers (or Letters) changed as the design and/or size was upgraded over the years.  In addition, some years require an additional wire bridge between two certain terminals for the relay to even work properly.  This shows a detailed diagram of which wires go where and why.<BR>This is a PDF File requiring Adobe Acrobat Reader (see previous link description above).<BR>For further details about the Headlight Relay, <A href="/library/electris/vw-hauptlicht-schalter.html">Click Here</A> to see Matt Roberds' excellent article on his website. 
<P><A HREF="hazard_switch_ovh.pdf">Hazard (Emergency) Switch Wiring Diagram</A><BR>Here's another switch I frequently get inquiries on regarding it's proper wiring.  This 9 page PDF (Adobe Acrobat required) shows how the switch is properly wired.  Models covered are Late 68-77 Standard Beetles, 71-72 Super Beetles, Late 68-74 Karmann Ghias, Late 68-79 Type 2s, Late 68-73 Type 3s and 71-74 Type 4s.  73-79 Super Beetles & 80-91 Vanagons to be added later on.
<P><A href="/library/heating/vw-heater-box-lever.html">Heater Box Replacement & Helpful Tips</A><BR>By Matt Roberds of the Type 2 and VintageBus Mailing List<BR>Although written for his 64 Bus, this step-by-step write-up with photos apply to Beetles/Karmann Ghias from January 1963 through 1974 and Buses from January 1963 through 1967, all equipped with the "Fresh Air" Heater System.  Very thorough and helpful hints everywhere and a must-read if you want to stay warm during those cold winters.
<P><B>9 Terminal Flasher Troubleshooting, Replacement and Alternatives</B><BR>Another great write-up by Matt Roberds.<BR><B>SAVE MONEY ON EXPENSIVE FLASHER REPAIRS!</B><BR>Perhaps by far the best article covering this infamous set-up for the turn signals originally designed<BR>and utilized on the 66 thru Early 68 Type 2 Buses.  Includes information and exstensive color wiring diagrams.  Worth downloading the PNG's and html into your PC or Mac for on-the-site troubleshooting and repair.  I once did an article in my old catalog on this about 12 years ago, but by today's standards it is real crude - this one by Matt is much more concise and I think easier to understand.  Although Terminals 54 & 54f are NOT used on Bug & Karmann Ghia applications, this info can be used to troubleshoot and repair them as well (66-Early 68 Models).<BR>This write-up is now located in the Type2.com library at:<BR>

<P><A HREF="6870turnswitcht1_OVH.pdf">Late 68-70 Type 1 Turn Signal Wiring</A><BR>Probably one of the most requested procedures I get on the phone or email.  This PDF shows how the original 4 Terminal Flasher Box is properly connected and how the Turn Signal Switch is wired up on Late 68 thru 1970 Beetles & Karmann Ghias (From Vin 1x8 381 367).  Since the 4 Terminal Flasher Box hasn't been available new for almost 2 decades, you can use the 3 Terminal Flasher Box (71-later models, VW Part # 111-953-227A or D [or latest VW Part # 191-953-227]) by following the note in the diagram provided. 
<P><A HREF="http://www.specialpatrolgroup.co.uk/spooky/barrel/barrel.html">Ignition Switch, Steering Lock and Lock Cylinder Replacement - 71 to Early 74 Type 2 Bus</A><BR>By Mike Howles of the Type 2 Mailing List.<BR>Robert Bentley's procedure is somewhat lacking when discussing the removal, repair and replacement of these items.  Mike's photo step-by-step procedure with excellent pictures offers better hand holding.  He did this on his 72 Bus, but the procedure applies to 71-Early 74 Models (To VIN 2x4 2164 059).<BR>For Late 74 to 79 Type 2 Buses (From VIN 2x4 2164 060), check out Richard Atwell's redesign of Brad Clausen's excellent photo step-by-step Tutorial with photos he used on his 78 Bus (with some fine-tuned re-writing and photos from Jamie Rivers):<BR> <B>(Note: This is link has (again) changed effective 3/9/2009 - Please update YOUR Bookmark/Favorite!)</B><BR>
