    Oil Cooler Installation - Upright 12-1600 &amp; "Flat" Type 4 Engines

<SMALL>Volkswagen Cases 1200-1600 thru 1969 came with "small" oil galleries and single
relief oil systems. The original oil coolers installed on them used the
111-117-151 seal.  However, with the introduction the dual
relief cases in 1970, the oil galleries were enlarged and a "stepped" seal
was introduced to install the small hole oil cooler onto the large hole case.
As time went on, Volkswagen eventually upgraded the replacement cooler with
the larger holes, but now it required this same "stepped" seal to be used
when installing it on an early, small hole case. Seal Kit 111-198-029 comes with two of these stepped seals and they must be installed
as shown below to prevent leaks. The same applies if retro-fitting a Doghouse
Style Cooler stand to an early, small hole case. How do you tell if
you have a small hole case? Check the engine number as well as the size of
the holes on the case. Beetle (Engine # B600001 on), Bus (Engine # B5116437
on) and all engines beginning with 2 letters (AB, AE, AH, etc.,) are usually
dual relief cases with large (10mm) holes. All other cases are usually single relief cases with small 8mm holes). See the diagrams below for correct seal installation:</SMALL>

<SMALL>Here's a question I have been asked a number of times when customers
are buying a new replacement Non-Doghouse Oil Cooler (VW 111-117-021E ) for their Dual Relief Case: What seals do I use with this?
Because the replacement Non-Doghouse Oil Cooler has the larger holes and
the Dual Relief Case has the larger holes the correct seals to use are the
"Red" Seals used on 71-79 Upright Engines because the hole sizes are the same
on both sides. 2 seals are required of course (021-117-151A).</SMALL>

more than 5 foot pounds!</B>

The "Hoover Bit"
</H4>
</CENTER>
<P>
<SMALL>
To insure proper sealing and anti-vibration to the upright Doghouse Oil Cooler, VW installed a small "L" shaped bracket known and discussed on the mailing lists as the "Hoover Bit", named in honor of Bob Hoover, a major contributor on the Type 2, Vintage Bus and Vanagon Mailing Lists, as well as to several VW club newsletters during the past several years.  In the past, most people ignorant of this important piece of hardware simply tossed it away, thinking it was just a hunk of metal that didn't need to be re-installed, just in the way, an additional step to be eliminated.  Without it however, it results in a crucial loss of cooling air in the fan shroud and cooler "doghouse".  And we all know what happens when you lose cooling air.  VW hasn't made this piece of metal for a long time and finding one in the recycling yard is like.....well, you know the story of the needle in the haystack.  What does a "Hoover Bit" look like?  Thanks to a post David Raistrick in April 2000 made to the Type 2 List, here is a link to check out:

In a nutshell, install your Doghouse Cooler System right the FIRST time and use a "Hoover Bit".
