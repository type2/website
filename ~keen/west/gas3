Subject: Mixing your own gas

 A subject came up today at the laundomat. I and this grizzled young
cowboy were discussing the merits of big blocks versus Volkswagens.
 He was real nice considering his tires dwarfed the bug.

 He's got a "440 whatcha callum" and of course it eats gas. The carb
float bowl pro'lly held a gallon.
 
 I asked him about his compression ratio. " 13 and a half to 1" he says. I
asked him about fuel. Has to mix his own he told me.
 
 He puts 8 ounces of toluene to a tank of 92 octane gas (20 gal). Says
that's just enough to keep it from pinging. 
 
 There are formulas for this type of mixing floating out on the net 
some place. I haven't seen them for a while tho.
