     I will tell you what I've turned and it fits Bobs description of 2 stroke 4 cycle. He can nod or ignore us as he is wont to do. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     The only place in engine calcs that stroke is a value is in Indicated Horsepower. ihp = PLAN/33,000.
    </p>
    <p>
     Where:
    </p>
    <dl class="formula">
     <dt>P</dt>
     <dd>mean effective pressure of exploded gases in psi</dd>
     <dt>L</dt>
     <dd>length of stroke in feet</dd>
     <dt>A</dt>
     <dd>area of cylinder in square inches</dd>
     <dt>N</dt>
     <dd>number of power strokes per minute</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
     It goes on to say: In a four cycle engine an explosion takes place on alternate down strokes of each piston.
    </p>
    <p>
     This means the crankshaft makes 2 revolutions for each power stroke.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then if we are considering a four cylinder, four cycle engine, there will be 4 times 1/2 = 2 power strokes per revolution.
    </p>
    <p>
     In an eight cylinder engine there will be 4 power strokes per rev. (end quote)
    </p>
    <p>
     Nowhere else will a definition of stroke mean squat.
    </p>
    <p>
     I know I have been in error, one that carries over from the 8 cylinder cars. They are truly 4 stroke.
    </p>
    <p>
     Our favorite beastie is a 2 stroke 4 cycle in the engineering sense of the word. Knowing that I can calculate a value.
    </p>
    <p>
     OTOH many of you will prefer to keep your definitions and that's OK by me.
