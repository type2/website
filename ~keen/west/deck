      <p>
       I bought new C's and P's. I scrubbed two of the pistons for about fifteen minutes each with Bon Ami cleanser. I rinsed, and rinsed, and rinsed some more with boiling water. I careful to scrub in a round and round vs. an up and down motion. I've got two more to do, but I hated the whole procedure, so I'm putting it off for another day. When they are dry, I'll paint them. The Hoover sermon recomends oil based enamal, which I'm using on all the tin. Won't that just bake off the jug?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd like to balance by rods, BUT if the wrist pin end needs re-bushing aren't I just wasting my time? I don't think the rods are damaged and I'm pretty sure I can do a respectable job of balancing the rods both overall and end to end. If I have to damn the budget (which is already shot) should I buy re-conditioned rods and balance those? (RM. 7.50 each, I think the shop here has some or I could call RIMCO-I lost their phone #) I'd sure hate to spend all the time on my rods only to find that it was wasted, or worse only make it 200 yards on my rebuild.
      </p>
      <p>
       I borrowed a 1/10 gram accuracy beam scale from school. As long as I'm waiting this seems like a good time to balance pistons and rods.
      </p>
      <p>
       ALSO, any advice on what I need to cobble together to measure deck height when that time comes? The &quot;official&quot; tool is forty bucks, nearly twice the price of new rods :-)

      Well Ken, you can mike the two parts, your new wrist pins and the bores on the rods. Should be .0004 - .0008 clearance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Or you can just try the wrist pin in the rod. Should be what's called a &quot;push-fit&quot;. Check them when all parts are at room temperature.
     </p>
     <p>
      You make the call.
     </p>
     <p>
      Hoover recommends a very, very very thin coat of enamel.
     </p>
     <p>
      It will stay on there as well as anything else.
     </p>
     <p>
      To check &quot;deck height&quot; all you need are some spacers on the head studs to take up the space where the head will normally be.
     </p>
     <p>
      I make them from short pieces of pipe. 3/8 or 1/2&quot;
     </p>
     <p>
      The deal here is to pull the jug down into place without the head and then make the measurement.
     </p>
     <p>
      Example of spacers: I have 2 here that are 1-1/2&quot; lg and 2 that are 3&quot; long. You could just go buy pipe nipples to do it with.
     </p>
     <p>
      To measure the &quot;deck-height, all you need is a straight edge to go across the top of the jug and a feeler gauge.
