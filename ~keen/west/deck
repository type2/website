 Well Ken, you can mike the two parts, your new wrist pins and the
bores on the rods. Should be .0004 - .0008 clearance.

Or you can just try the wrist pin in the rod. Should be what's called
a "push-fit". Check them when all parts are at room temperature.

You make the call.

 Hoover recommends a very, very very thin coat of enamel.

 It will stay on there as well as anything else.

 To check "deck height" all you need are some spacers on the head studs to
take up the space where the head will normally be.

I make them from short pieces of pipe. 3/8 or 1/2"

 The deal here is to pull the jug down into place without the head
and then make the measurement.

Example of spacers: I have 2 here that are 1-1/2" lg and 2 that are
3" long. You could just go buy pipe nipples to do it with.

To measure the "deck-height, all you need is a straight edge to go across
the top of the jug and a feeler gauge.
