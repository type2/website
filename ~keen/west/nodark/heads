      <p>
       Just a wintertime thought. Having more time than money, I was wondering if I shouldn't just buy a set of used heads, and port and polish and add big valves myself. The price up here for 041 heads are 249 dollars each, which is 39mm and 32mm valves, and improved spark plug holes, and combustion chambers for 22% increase over stock flow. Can I port &amp; polish to match these? Thanks,
      </p>

      Haven't seen any replies to this. The troops are all out playing with the new toys or just fell asleep. :-)
     </p>

      Can you port, polish and add new big valves and get a 22% increase in flow is what you want to know.
     </p>
     <p>
      I haven't looked at the various flow charts laying around here but would suspect you could get a 10% increase in flow in a pair of dual ports by p&amp;p'ing them.
     </p>
     <p>
      Adding bigger valves: you got a mill? you'll need a mill to counter-bore the heads for the new valve seats.
     </p>
     <p>
      Frankly I've never bought a valve seat but I imagine my flaps can get them if I want them.
     </p>
     <p>
      So I suppose you could get the old seats out and get a machine shop to c'bore the new seat holes for say $100 a pair.
     </p>
     <p>
      The reason for the price is set-up charges, not run time.
     </p>
     <p>
      Then you have to take them home and set up a sturdy work bench in the kitchen.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the kitchen because you need access to the oven and the freezer.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sturdy because once you freeze the seat and heat the head, you have to mate them and pound the seat in with great zeal.
     </p>
     <p>
      Now you can move back out to the shop and start working the new seats down with whatever type stone till you get them close to where you want them.
     </p>
     <p>
      You want them all the same height and within .005" using the face of the oil cover seal as reference. The deal here is that all the valve stems have to come out the same height on the other side when you're done.
     </p>
     <p>
      The best seat for flow etc. they say is a 3 angle job.
     </p>
     <p>
      They use, say, a 30 degree stone inside, a 44-1/2 degree for the seat and a 25 degree on the outer lip.
     </p>
     <p>
      Since we're doing this by hand, just go get a half dozen valves ground to the 44-1/2 degree and lap them in by hand.
     </p>
     <p>
      When you get them all lapped and all the same height stem-wise on the farside, you could say you have it whipped.
     </p>
     <p>
      Yes, they do have sets of stones to do this and tooling like guides and stops etc., probably for a standard mill or maybe even for a hand held air die grinder.
     </p>
     <p>
      I'm willing to bet it's cheaper to get Berg to sell you a set of heads unless you want to build a hundred.
     </p>
     <p>
      I may even be exagerating the difficulty. They may come all at a nice height for installing and have the 3 angle already cut.
     </p>
     <p>
      I doubt it though since, the pounding in the seats is not exactly piloted off the valve guide.
     </p>
     <p>
      Anyway, that's a rough idea of what it takes to get a set in there and ground to the right dimensions.
     </p>
     <p>
      The improved spark plug holes is a case of welding the old hole closed and boring a new one in a slightly different location. Mainly for better clearance from the new big valve seats.
     </p>
     <p>
      Hope I've not made it sound too negative. :-)
     </p>
     <p>
      Bob Hoover would actually have a better idea of the possibilities than I.
