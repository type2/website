     Greetings Volks... Catchy subject, right?
    </p>
    <p>
     Anywho, on to the fun part. This happened on Monday, the names were changed to protect the Guilty.
    </p>
    <p>
     First the ingredients:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>Smooth 12 acre field coated solid with ice. (It NEVER does this here)(OK, maybe once every 7 or 8 years)</li>
     <li>1 Brush Buggy From Hell fitted with snow tires and ice studs(it's too ugly to post a pic of)</li>
     <li>1 40 foot piece of nylon rope.(3/8&quot; kinda stretchy)</li>
     <li>1 71 Super Beetle hood(any year works, but this one was dinged up pretty bad anyway, so it was "sacrificed" for the fun of all involved)</li>
     <li>One piece of butt paddin(foam)</li>
     <li>About every kid(6-48yrs) within miles.(word spreads fast when fun &amp; foolishness is involved)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     Run the rope thru the old handle holes in the hood with a knot on each side. Leave some rope on the inside of the hood to hold on to. Hook other end to buggy. Insert neighborhood kid in hood, drive around in circles and figure eights and such until they start to freeze, go back to shop and get next kidsickle, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
     The kid line never ended, it just got dark. We burned about 4 gallons of gas. Froze most of the kids a couple of times. Had a blast and haven't caught pneumonia, yet! I'm sure if any of the kids get sick I'll hear about it, tho!
    </p>
    <p>
     Keep on Vdubbin...
    </p>
    <p>
     Preserve a Vintage VW for Future Visual Stimulation<br/>
     and enjoy Miles and Miles of Smiles - - VW Style!<br/>
     Cheers,<br/>
