      Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to all the crazy VW people (I'm one) on this list!
     </p>
     <p>
      My spouse thinks I am nuts for keeping the one I have, how do I explain (or do I need to?) getting another one? Maybe this will all pass when I get the bill for this Christmas, but for now, I want another. Anybody else have this problem?

     Tell her you need another bus because the Isuzu might blow up.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tell her they always go up in value and are a better investment than
     California real estate.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tell her you need a place to keep the set of snow tires for the Westy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tell her it's for when the kids go to college.  You don't want them driving
     something of unknown origins and if you work on this new bus for a few
     years you'll really know its mechanicals.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tell her it is to keep somebody from junking it and screwing up the
     environment.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tell her VW buses are the only vehicles easily converted to solar electric
     and some day everybody will be solar electric.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tell her people hide drugs and diamonds in them and the odds are much
     better than the lottery of finding said treasures.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tell her it's cheaper than a new addition and you can sleep in the vans
     when she gets mad at you for buying another van.  (If this makes sense to
     her repeat the one about the drugs and diamonds.  Leave out the diamonds
     part.)
    </p>
    <p>
     Tell her vans keep men from going out with women not their wives.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tell her driveways last longer with vans parked over them and we all know
     how expensive driveways are.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tell her they keep conservative Republicans from moving into the neighborhood.
    </p>
    <p>
     I fear we may start a dnagerous thread here.
