     So Mike covers the new Dwell/Tachs, Sean covers the middle-aged Dwell/tachs, and it is left for me to cover the ancient Dwell/Tachs :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     The Dwell/Tach I have been using since I was a callow youth is one of your base-line cheapies.  In case you may have inheritied a similar pup, it is easy to recognize in its simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
     It consists of an analog guage, a switch that reads dwell at one position and tach at the other and a grand total of two wires, one red and one black.
    </p>
    <p>
     As always the black wire attaches to any convenient ground.  The red wire attaches to one of the two terminals on the coil.  Ahh, but which one you ask?  Well, if your car is functional, try both.  One will pin the meter the other won't.  You want the terminal that does not pin the meter :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     If the car will not start, then you need either a friend or a remote starter switch.  While the engine is cranking, try each terminal.  Again you want to connect to the terminal that produces a reading, rather than the terminal that pins the meter.
    </p>
    <p>
     NB:  In the case that the engine will not run and *both* terminals on the coil cause the meter to pin, then your points have stuck!  Try manually opening the points a time or two.  For some reason, if an engine has sat for a while, the points *can* stick closed.
    </p>
    <p>
     NB2: These pups were made in an era that assumed that you either owned a 6 or 8 cylinder car, so for a 4 you need to read the guage for 1/2 the 8 cylinder reading or 25 degrees dwell rather than the 50 that we all know and love.
