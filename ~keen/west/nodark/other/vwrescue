      Hi all,
     </p>
     <p>
              the title is misleading; you probably thought I meant that a 1958<br/>
Beetle was just saved from the scrapper.
     </p>
     <p>
              Rather, this is the story of a 1947 VW that was *rescued*from*the*<br/>
*scrapper* in 1958!  I was reading some old auto magazines the other day<br/>
and came across this hilarious article from the October 1959 issue of Sports<br/>
Cars Illustrated magazine.  I think it speaks to all of us even after all<br/>
these years.  I can&#x27;t resist sharing it, so I&#x27;m going to send it here in<br/>
installments (it gets even better as it goes on).  Here&#x27;s the first.
     </p>

&quot;VW the Hard Way,&quot; by Henning B. Deiter
       </p>
       <p>
                Does your car start at the press of a button?  Did you obtain<br/>
your last inspection sticker without physical exertion, mental anguish or<br/>
bribery?  Will a qualified mechanic service your engine without loud<br/>
guffaws?  Did your dream car cost you half the price of a comfortable<br/>
home?  If the answer to any of the above questions is &quot;yes&quot;, then you are<br/>
not an auto-sport but just another motorist.  A speed boat driver is not<br/>
a yachtsman, nor should motorists be confused with car sports.  The word<br/>
&quot;sport&quot; connotes gambling, self participation, physical exertion,<br/>
adventure, skill, prowess, ingenuity, and amusement.  If your driving<br/>
lacks these essentials and you simply use your automobile to drive from<br/>
one place to another with monotonous regularity, you may consider<br/>
yourself only a motorist, and an amateur at that.
       </p>
       <p>
                Perhaps deep reflection on the psychology behind the above<br/>
paragraph may indicate why the writer was unable to say &quot;no&quot; when faced<br/>
with the not altogether lucrative opportunity to purchase a badly<br/>
battered 1947 Volkswagen at a local junk yard.
       </p>
       <p>
                Actually I have wanted a beetle for years and years, ever since<br/>
missing my first opportunity to buy one at an Army Exchange surplus sale<br/>
in Frankfurt am Main in the self-same 1947.  &quot;Over 300 Used Volkswagens<br/>
for Sale&quot; read the ad in the &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot;.  &quot;Priced from $250 to<br/>
$350, First Come First Served.  Sale Starts at 0800 Monday Morning&quot;.<br/>
Since I was very cunning in those days and knew a bargain when it came<br/>
along, I drove my army surplus amphibious jeep with the bow and stern cut<br/>
off to Frankfurt from Wiesbaden Sunday night to be sure to be among the<br/>
first in line.  It didn&#x27;t work.  The parking lot in front of the Army<br/>
Exhange warehouse was a veritable hobo jungle of Quartermaster Corps<br/>
Commandos who had been bivouacked there since Friday night, all carefully<br/>
guarding each other&#x27;s place in line, three hundred and fifty strong, and<br/>
well provisioned with cash.  I made a point of looking over the<br/>
automobiles carefully before deciding that they weren&#x27;t worth the money<br/>
after all.  In the next twelve years I waited patiently for the world to<br/>
wise up and the price to come down.  It finally happened.  I purchased<br/>
the beetle of my dreams about a year ago for the reasonable price of $240<br/>
cash.
       </p>
       <p>
                Only a fool would buy a car that doesn&#x27;t run, so I insisted on a<br/>
demonstration.  It was explained that the battery was dead, and that the<br/>
clutch was slightly out of adjustment.  But the car had obviously been<br/>
run in the recent past because it still had current license plates from<br/>
the state of Maine, as well as a U.S. Army in Europe registration<br/>
document.  I accepted mine host&#x27;s kind offer to push the car for a<br/>
demonstration before I realized that he meant to push it with another<br/>
car, rather than by hand, and by then it was too late.  He was right<br/>
behind me in a veteran Austin Sedan, and like the lady in the now ancient<br/>
joke, trying desperately to get me going about 35 miles per hour, or<br/>
let&#x27;s see, 5/8 mile equals 1 km, so 1 mile equals 8/5 km, therefore 35<br/>
miles is 8/5 times 35 or 56 km per hour if you prefer.  By this time the<br/>
engine was running, but the rear bumper had become disengaged at one end<br/>
and was dragging on the ground.  It might be mentioned for the<br/>
uninitiated that the bumpers we see on European automobiles are not<br/>
generally used for bumping in the American sense, but are more in the<br/>
nature of trim or ornament.  In the case of the VW they are simply bolted<br/>
to the inside of the fender, since that is the most economical place to<br/>
bolt them.  After shrewdly calculating that the bumpers were not an<br/>
essential part of the running gear, and could easily be removed, I<br/>
refused to be diverted by this apparent catastrophe, or the secondary<br/>
failure which had occurred in the attached fendres, trunk lid (or rather<br/>
engine cover, hood, or bonnet, sinche the engine is in the trunk) and<br/>
stop lights.  I concentrated intently on the sound of the engine in order<br/>
to determine if there were any burned out bearings.  I detected only a<br/>
smooth whirring sound resembling an eggbeater or a sewing machine.<br/>
Having decided that the engine was in excellent condition, I paid the man<br/>
his stipend and scampered merrily on my way.  Since I was already the<br/>
owner of a 1951 Borgward Hansa, the idea bagan taking shape in my mind<br/>
that I would become a collector of fine, imoported, antique German<br/>
automobiles.

       <p>
                It soon became obvious that a few minor adjustments would have<br/>
to be made before the people&#x27;s car would be quite up to what may be<br/>
called American people&#x27;s standards.  The first obvious trouble was in<br/>
the braking system, or rather the lack of it.  Since the clutch would<br/>
disengage only with great difficulty, it was impractical to stop the car<br/>
with the usual expedient of shifting into low gear, or when necessary,<br/>
reverse.  And since the motor wouldn&#x27;t start with a dead battery it was<br/>
impractical to stop the car by cutting the ignition, so the brakes had<br/>
to be fixed.  A spot check under the car with the aid of a dental mirror<br/>
revealed that the brakes were mechanical and not hydraulic.  They were<br/>
therefore within the operating range of a do-it-yourself tool box<br/>
complete with a collection of German taps, dies, and wrenches.  The job<br/>
was under way without any hesitation, but was complicated by the fact<br/>
that German wrenches are notorious for not fitting German bolts and<br/>
nuts.  A wrench to fit a nut exactly 14-millimeters in diameter is<br/>
called a number 14 and measures exactly 14-millimeters.  A 14-millimeter<br/>
wrench will theoretically almost fit a 14-mm nut, but in practice fits<br/>
only with the aid of a hammer or a hydraulic press.  The engineering<br/>
behind the development of this system of nuts and wrenches can only be<br/>
understood by those who have had long years of experience or have<br/>
studied the traditional German or indirect approach to engineering<br/>
problems.  In short it may be explained that the bolts, nuts, and<br/>
wrenches developed by the German machine tool industry are contrived<br/>
with Machiavellian cunning to sabotage the French or metric system of<br/>
measurements in favor of the English, because an ordinary 9/16-inch<br/>
wrench fits the bolt in question with no trouble.  Once the elements of<br/>
the indirect approach are mastered, it becomes a simple matter to repair<br/>
the mechanical brakes on the 1947 VW.  In this case there was no need to<br/>
waste any time looking for an adjustable nut to take up slack in the<br/>
brake cables, or tracking down the linkage between the brake pedal and<br/>
the drums.  It was noticed that each cable housing fit rather sloppily<br/>
into a bushing in the side of its corresponding brake drum.  The cable<br/>
housing could be pulled in and out of this bushing or receptacle about<br/>
one inch on each wheel.  The obvious (indirect) solution to the problem<br/>
of taking up slack in the brake cables was to cut four small strips of<br/>
brass 1/2-in. wide by 1 1/2-in. long, and bend them with a pair of<br/>
pliers into the shape of a &quot;C&quot; or a half moon or crescent.  Each of<br/>
these brass clamps was then simply crimped over the portion of the brake<br/>
cable which peeped out when the cable housing was yanked back away from<br/>
the brake drum.  This was done in about the same way as you sometimes<br/>
put ten or fifteen washers under a bolt when it is too long, except that<br/>
in the case of the brake cable you have to use a &quot;C&quot; shaped washer<br/>
because the ends of the cable are not exposed, or even explored.  After<br/>
the slack or bight in the cable was taken up, final adjustment was made<br/>
by sawing off a piece of a 2 by 2 long enough to reach from one&#x27;s knee<br/>
to the ground.  This 2 by 2 was propped between the driver&#x27;s seat and<br/>
the brake pedal to hold the brake pedal in the depressed or stop<br/>
position.  Each wheel was then jacked up off the ground with the aid of<br/>
an ordinary or non-bumper type jack, and spun.  It was discovered that<br/>
the brake drums are equipped with the same magic nut as the venerable<br/>
Model &quot;A&quot; Ford.  By turning the magic nut to a certain key position it<br/>
was found that the wheel stopped, i.e. the brake was holding.  In all<br/>
other positions the wheel didn&#x27;t stop, so it was necessary to find this<br/>
trick position for each nut on each wheel.  Although the adjustment was<br/>
accurate enough for most purposes, it was found that even better<br/>
equalization could be obtained by the simple expedient of turning the<br/>
steering wheel slightly to the left or right, depending on which way the<br/>
car tended to swerve when brakes were applied.  Swinging the steering<br/>
wheel while depressing the horn button also improves the electrical<br/>
contacts in the horn circuit.
       </p>
       <p>
                The unique design of the VW would have brought about a<br/>
revolution in passenger comfort had it not been for the need to have a<br/>
place to put the brake and clutch linkage.  By putting the engine in the<br/>
stern between the hind wheels it was no longer necessary for an<br/>
automobile to have a tunnel through its middle for the transmission and<br/>
drive shaft.  However a place was needed to put the handbrake lever, the<br/>
clutch linkage, the footbrake cables, the throttle cable, the choke<br/>
cable, the heater cable, and the gear shift linkage, so the tunnel had<br/>
to stay and even became the main structural member of the frame.<br/>

       </p>
       <p>
                Once the brakes had been adjusted, it seemed logical to go to<br/>
work on the clutch cable since it was apparently a similar problem in<br/>
rigging.  The frayed clutch cable was replaced by removing two bolts<br/>
which hold the clutch pedal to the side of the tunnel, disconnecting the<br/>
ends of the cable, and pulling the old cable out.  Putting in a new<br/>
cable was a more adventurous undertaking which will be much easier next<br/>
time.  The operation &quot;may present certain difficulties&quot; according to<br/>
Hank Elfrink in his book on the VW.  This understatement might be worded<br/>
a little more correctly as being similar to threading a needle in the<br/>
dark while standing on your head.  This is also an understatement<br/>
because it fails to mention the penalty or handicap for failure.  Each<br/>
time the cable is improperly threaded it snags on the hand brake linkage<br/>
and can be extricated only with the aid of a size 10-C leather boot.<br/>
Here again the proper German or indirect approach is to drill two<br/>
3/8-in. holes in the tunnel, then peer in one of them and hold a<br/>
flashlight to the other to illuminate the interior of the tunnel.  Once<br/>
the cable is properly inserted it becomes a simple matter to adjust the<br/>
clutch.  A 9/16-in. box wrench is sawed off 1 1/2-in. from the end, and<br/>
with this device it is possible to reach up behind the rear axle between<br/>
the bell housing, motor mount, heater box, main frame, and fan duct to<br/>
tighten the adjusting nut.  There is also a small lock nut which is<br/>
supposed to be tightened to hold the adjusting nut in place, but since<br/>
the size is unknown and tightening the nut would require sawing off a<br/>
complete collection of small wrenches or a vernier caliper to a length<br/>
of 1 1/2-in., the project has been postponed until a later date.
       </p>
       <p>
                After emergency repairs had been completed it was decided to<br/>
undertake some performance tests.  As can be seen from the chart, the<br/>
1947 VW lacks some of the refinements of more expensive automobiles.<br/>
For instance, the shimmy in the front wheels was caused by a worn out<br/>
wheel bearing.  The bearing is the same as the front wheel bearing on a<br/>
bicycle and is repaired in the same way.  Acceleration was found to be<br/>
inversely proportional to the amount of load in the car.  Braking was<br/>
found to be spasmodic even after repairs had been completed.

     </h2>
     <p>
      Hi all,
     </p>
     <p>
              here is the fourth &amp; final installment of &quot;VW the Hard Way,&quot; that<br/>
story of a 1947 Beetle brought back to life in 1958.  This article by<br/>
Henning B. Dieter appeared in the October 1959 &quot;Sports Cars Illustrated&quot;<br/>
magazine.  I posted the first three portions several weeks back, and have<br/>
only now finished.  I took the liberty of posting both to vintagvw &amp; type2,<br/>
as I feel that it is a voice out of the past that speaks to all of us with<br/>
that nutty VW spirit.
     </p>
     <p>
              There&#x27;s more news!  I have contacted the author who wrote the<br/>
article over 37 years ago.  I looked him up &amp; sent him a letter, and he<br/>
responded; I&#x27;ll repost snippets of his letter later.  Hope you enjoy this<br/>
final installment of &quot;VW the Hard Way!&quot;

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <br/>
        Extensive road tests over the hills and dales of Central Texas<br/>
emphasized some of the characteristics of small sport cars which are<br/>
apparent even in some of the most modern jobs.  An encounter with a<br/>
moderate size skunk became a near catastrophe.  Head-on collisions should<br/>
be avoided because the gasoline tank of the VW is in the driver&#x27;s lap.  An<br/>
attempt to ford a small stream, a common maneuver in this part of the<br/>
country, brought about unexpected problems.  The blower which cools the<br/>
engine picks up water and blasts it out through the defroster openings<br/>
behind the windshield and under the driver&#x27;s feet.  The same thing happens<br/>
on days which are both et and cold, so it might be a good idea to equip the<br/>
VW with double windshield wipers, inside and out.  Parking the VW is no<br/>
problem, except that parallel parking is out because of the bumpers.  In<br/>
many places the car can simply be parked on the sidewalk, since the police<br/>
will assume that it was placed there by pranksters.  It may be left safely<br/>
in a tow away zone because there is no way that the vehicle can be lifted<br/>
by a wrecker once the bumpers are removed.  The bumpers must be removed in<br/>
order to protect the fenders, and in order to do this the owner has to work<br/>
up strong moral convictions that bumpers are sociologically wrong, since<br/>
people should not go around bumping each other.  Once over the<br/>
philosophical hurdle, the actual removal takes only 15 minutes with the<br/>
indispensable 9/16-in. wrench.  Other items which are easily removed and<br/>
disposed of are the rear seat, the sidewinding jack which comes with the<br/>
car, the hub caps, inspection hole covers, and the trim strips on the<br/>
running board.
       </p>
       <p>
                No description of the VW would be complete without a few words<br/>
about its remarkable engine which runs and runs on about a dollars worth of<br/>
gas per week.  Imagine a hole in the bottom of the trunk of your car, then<br/>
imagine a small outboard motor suspended in space.  If you were to then<br/>
pick up your car and drop it neatly over the engine descried, fastening it<br/>
in with four bolts you would have a Volkswagen.  You can make major repairs<br/>
to the engine, transmission, or differential on your front lawn, without<br/>
any chain hoist or tools other than a handful of 9/16-in. wrenches.  The<br/>
engine is removed by sliding three old inner tubes, inflated, under the<br/>
back end of the car.  The four bolts are removed, the air is let out of the<br/>
inner tubes, and the engine is dragged out from under the trunk.. Once<br/>
removed, the engine is best left alone, since it seems to run as long as it<br/>
isn&#x27;t tampered with.  The transmission is similarly removed, but<br/>
unfortunately it sometimes needs repairs.  The selector forks get broken<br/>
and need to be replaced.  This is a simple matter because the transmission<br/>
case is cast magnesium and opens up like a walnut shell with no gaskets or<br/>
seals.  The broken gears, forks, bearings, or what have you are simply<br/>
replaced and the walnut shell bolted back together.  The old gear oil can<br/>
be reused unless it has chunks of iron in it.  Any repairs which are more<br/>
involved than overhauling the transmission should be left to experienced,<br/>
factory trained mechanics.  Minor repairs are easily performed by the<br/>
novice, providing he keeps the indirect approach idea in the back of his<br/>
mind.
       </p>
       <p>
                The VW engine is provided with a fascinating device which makes it<br/>
possible to start under any conditions.  Behind the engine in the body<br/>
panel which goes over the fence last is a small opening through which may<br/>
be inserted a key or crank to turn the engine over by hand until it starts.<br/>
(Newer Vws do not have this do-it-yourself starting feature.)  The<br/>
manufacturer has failed to exploit this unique invention in solving one of<br/>
his most perplexing problems, where to put the battery.  In Wehrmacht&#x27;s<br/>
VW&#x27;s the battery had to be placed between the knees of the Commanding<br/>
Officer, and now it is stuck under the passenger&#x27;s seat in lieu of coil<br/>
springs.  By using the crank it is possible to do without the battery<br/>
altogether, and decrease the 0-60 acceleration time to 16.5 seconds.
       </p>
       <p>
                The performance of the 1947 VW leaves nothing to be desired,<br/>
because driving it is great fun under any conditions.  Maintenance is<br/>
likewise sheer fascination if you are the type who likes to monkey with<br/>
electric trains and Christmas tree lighting.  If you are a connoisseur, the<br/>
styling and appearance of the VW will appeal to you because, with the<br/>
bumpers removed, the VW has all the succulent appearance of a wood duck<br/>
with freshly plucked tailfeathers.
