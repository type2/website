 They make great stands for your grinder, worklight etc.

 Stick a pipe on them and they can be used for hanging a tarp for
 temporary shelter.

 Great door-stops.

Well, I understand that an old drum makes a good charcoal fired forge.
Just hook up a hair dryer (without heat) to pump air through the hole in
the middle and you can get decent temperature out of it.  They say the
cast drums won't burn through.  Just a thought.  :<)

I've seen one used as the firepot for a gas-fired forge.  (can't use up very
many that way tho... ;-)

I've seen people turn them into lamps (using them as the base), I've seen
people convert them into clocks, saw one guy make a sundial out of his ...
my Dad uses one to prop the back door of the garage open ... I even saw one
that was chrome plated and made into a trophy.

I say, cut the middle out of it, oh say about a 4-5 inch diameter hole and
then use it for a Christmas tree stand.  :c)
