     Oil Temp Saga in Baby ... part one (mini series)
    </h2>
    <p>
     Hey all ...
    </p>
    <p>
     History/Background: Engine is a 3+ year old Gex 1776 with 040 heads, 009 distributor with a Perlux Ignitor (been in the 009 even before I got the Gex motor), dual Kadron carbs (stock jetting), BugPack Turbo Muff and oil breather box (both valve covers are vented as well as the spin on oil filler cap), recently rebuild the 040 heads with new TRW valves and springs along with the replacement of the main oil seal.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ok .. that's a brief history of the engine.  :c)
    </p>
    <p>
     The oil pressure gauge and temp gauge is fed off a copper "T" fitting from SunPro ... for the last couple of years, the gauge has been reporting back an average temp of 160-175F.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yesterday, I borrowed a digital temp meter (made by Fluke) from our facilities department.  Didn't get a chance to test the oil temp in Baby ('61 Bug) last night but I drove her into work this morning.  When I left the house, it was about 60 degrees, humidity was around 70% and rising (lots of fog here near the mountains).  Got to work, Carlsbad where the outside was (when I pulled in around 7am PST) 60 degrees humidity felt about the same as when I left, but hard to say (and it was even more foggy here on the coast).  I drove Baby no different than I normally do.  Maybe a bit slower because of the patchy dense fog (average MPH was 65).  And the drive from home to work is about 35 miles one way.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pulled into the parking lot and with the engine still running, I attached the meter's probe to the "T" fitting and took a reading, it reported back 180F, I put the probe on the dip stick and it came back with 185F ... placed the probe on the dipstick tube and it was 185-186F ... for kicks, I placed it on the block under the 009 and it reported back 190F.
    </p>
    <p>
     Turned the engine off ... pulled the dip stick off and leaving the oil on the stick, I took another reading, 185F was what the Fluke reported back ... I switched the probes to a longer probe-needle (about 8 inches in length) and carefully inserted it down the dip stick tube and took a reading of the oil which was 186F (average, it kept jumping from 185 thru 187F but seemed to steady out around 186F).
    </p>
    <p>
     We're suppose to have sun later this afternoon, at which time I will take a trip down to Encinitas for pasta (Ruso's Pasta) and see what the reading will be like in the afternoon temp.
    </p>
    <p>
     Stay tuned for part two in this non-PBS mini series.  :c)

    <p>
     Ok folks, part two in my mini series --
    </p>
    <p>
     Welp, the sun didn't shine at all this afternoon regardless as to what the weather person said (partly cloudy with sunshine later this afternoon *NOT!* ).  The sun never came out, at least not here on Faraday Avenue in Carlsbad California.  :c\
    </p>
    <p>
     The outside temp was about 65 degrees, humidity was down so I drove down to Encinitas for lunch which is a bout a 20 mile round trip (give or take). Pulled into the parking lot and with the engine running, I re-checked the temp --
    </p>
    <p>
     At the "T" fitting: 180F
    </p>
    <p>
     At the base of the dip stick tube: 183F
    </p>
    <p>
     On the dipstick: 184F
    </p>
    <p>
     On the block under the 009: 192F
    </p>
    <p>
     ... with the engine off:
    </p>
    <p>
     The oil on the dipstick: 186F
    </p>
    <p>
     Sticking the probe down the tube: 188F
    </p>
    <p>
     I'm hoping that it will be a sunny day tomorrow here in San Diego, perhaps take Baby out for a longer drive too and then re-check the temps.  But, for now, my temp sender (given it's location) seems to be about 10-15 degrees off.
    </p>
    <p>
     Again .. stay tuned for part three in my mini series.

     Y'all have a safe and good weekend.

    </h2>
    <p>
     Ok ...
    </p>
    <p>
     As I had hopped ... saturday ... today is a sunny and warm day here in San Diego.  The outside temp is about 70 degrees so after last night's antics, I decide to take it easy on Baby.
    </p>
    <p>
     We drove down to Del Mar California where I met a friend for coffee and, I guess you call it "brunch".  Then drove up the 5 north, hopped on the 78 and headed east then back down the 15 south headed for home.
    </p>
    <p>
     Got into my driveway and left the engine on and took my readings:
    </p>
    <p>
     At the "T" fitting: 183F
    </p>
    <p>
     At the base of the dip stick tube: 185F
    </p>
    <p>
     On the dipstick: 187F
    </p>
    <p>
     On the block under the 009: 194F
    </p>
    <p>
     ... with the engine off:
    </p>
    <p>
     The oil on the dipstick: 189F
    </p>
    <p>
     Sticking the probe down the tube: 192F
    </p>
    <p>
     So .. it looks like the temp of my oil is in the low 190F range.  I guess what I have to do now is re-locate my sender.  Or I should I get the Gene Berg dip stick sensor setup/thingie?
    </p>
    <p>
     I think in the spring time as well as next summer, I'll redo these measurements.
    </p>
    <p>
     I want to thank all that had concerns about me using the "T" fitting (John Kyte, James Lorentzen, Ric Campbell to name a few).  I will ditch this setup and budget a new system.
    </p>
    <p>
     After taking these new readings is "warmer" weather, I can see that my readings are about 20 degrees or so off .. to me, that's too much of a difference.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thanks again!
    </p>
