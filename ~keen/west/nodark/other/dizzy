     Hi Phil -
    </p>
    <p>
     009 distributors have long been known for what are called "flat spots". These are area on the power curve where the advance does not match the RPM or mixture. If your engine is otherwise stock, I would run a stock vacuum advance distributor. You can check your vacuum biscuit by gently sucking on the tube while watching the advance plate in the distributor. If the plate moves, and you can put your tongue over the tube and the plate stays (doesn't release itself), chances are the biscuit is good. The stock distributors seem to give the best overall performance and cure the hesitation problem. I usually only use a 009 if I put on a bigger carb setup or rejet the stock carb, as the 009 is set up better for that purpose.

     You might try VW for the rebuild parts. They surprised me recently...

     You might also want to make sure you don't have any vacuum leaks at the carb or in the manifold. To check this, while your engine is running, spray ether (BE CAREFUL HERE - ether is EXPLOSIVE) at the base of your carb and at all points where two pieces of your intake come together. If your RPMs change, you've found a vacuum leak! It could save your valves - aw heck, your whole engine. I had a vacuum leak in my 66 bus, where the manifold meets the head. Caused it to nearly die every time I hit the gas. Turned out to be loose, but it took a while (and a few pulled hairs) to find it.

     Cheers!
