       Since many found the article on the timing light useful, I have to assume there are more who haven't tried the dwell meter yet.

       Personally,I can recall a guy having one but no instructions and what the hell am I supposed to do with that bar-looking connection?

       Most of the dwell meters are called "Engine Analyzers".

     Mike and others, I know my father has a couple of the "old-school" engine analyzers banging around the garage, with all the dangling wires and the big analog needle.

     For Christmas I received a newfangled digital engine analyzer.  It came from Sears with the Sears brand name but is really made by SunPro.  This thing does all the things that Mike describes in his post but it's a lot simpler to operate.  For one thing, it gets its power from an internal 9V battery, so you don't have to worry about battery connections.  It comes with two test leads, one red, one black, both alligator clamps.  It has the capability to measure RPM on 4-cyl, 5-cyl, 6-cyl, and 8-cyl engines as well as dwell on those engines.  RPM is indicated in tens (950, 960, etc) and dwell is indicated to a tenth of a degree (44.1, etc).  It also measures DC volts and resistance, as well as a diode check.  I don't believe it has a provision for measuring amperage, however, but I don't have it right in front of me, I could be wrong.  It costs about $60 and if that's not enough for you, I know Trak Auto carries the all this and a LOT MORE version of this thing for around $90.  That one does pretty much everything.
    </p>

     It's about the size of a regular digital multimeter, maybe slightly smaller.  I have a regular multimeter from SunPro and the engine analyzer is a bit smaller.  It seems like a well-built piece of equipment and I prefer the alligator clamp test leads to the straight-pin test leads on the multimeter I have.

     Anyway, I just wanted to let everyone out there know that there are now more convenient ways to do things :)  .  Don't have to fool with that goofy bar connection anymore :) .  Actually, I never did know what that was for :) .
