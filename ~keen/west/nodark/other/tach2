Mike and others,
I know my father has a couple of the "old-school" engine analyzers banging
around the garage, with all the dangling wires and the big analog needle.

For Christmas I received a newfangled digital engine analyzer.  It came
from Sears with the Sears brand name but is really made by SunPro.  This
thing does all the things that Mike describes in his post but it's a lot
simpler to operate.  For one thing, it gets its power from an internal 9V
battery, so you don't have to worry about battery connections.  It comes
with two test leads, one red, one black, both alligator clamps.  It has the
capability to measure RPM on 4-cyl, 5-cyl, 6-cyl, and 8-cyl engines as well
as dwell on those engines.  RPM is indicated in tens (950, 960, etc) and
dwell is indicated to a tenth of a degree (44.1, etc).  It also measures DC
volts and resistance, as well as a diode check.  I don't believe it has a
provision for measuring amperage, however, but I don't have it right in
front of me, I could be wrong.  It costs about $60 and if that's not enough
for you, I know Trak Auto carries the all this and a LOT MORE version of
this thing for around $90.  That one does pretty much everything.

It's about the size of a regular digital multimeter, maybe slightly
smaller.  I have a regular multimeter from SunPro and the engine analyzer
is a bit smaller.  It seems like a well-built piece of equipment and I
prefer the alligator clamp test leads to the straight-pin test leads on the
multimeter I have.

Anyway, I just wanted to let everyone out there know that there are now
more convenient ways to do things :)  .  Don't have to fool with that goofy
bar connection anymore :) .  Actually, I never did know what that was for
:) .

Sean
