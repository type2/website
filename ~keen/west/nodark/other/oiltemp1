     Hey people ...
    </p>
    <p>
     This past weekend was the ideal weekend to put my SunPro (electric) oil gauge and sender (which is attached to the Gex 1776 via a "T" copper fitting). The weather was above 85 degrees. I had mentioned in the last post that I was thinking about going out to Riverside... I kinda missed that town and ended up in Las Vegas instead. A friend of mine got a free one night stay at the new casino "New York New York".
    </p>
    <p>
     We left Poway California around 5am PST and ended up in the city of Lost Wages close to noon. The weather was hot and dry. It was in the low 90's when we arrived. It was rumored to hit as high as 98-99 by the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
     Anyhoot... With the outside temp being in the 90's, here's the readings I got:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>At the "T" fitting: 190F</li>
     <li>At the base of the dip stick tube: 193F</li>
     <li>On the dipstick: 195F</li>
     <li>On the block under the 009: 197F</li>
     <li>... with the engine off:</li>
     <li>The oil on the dipstick: 195F</li>
     <li>Sticking the probe down the tube: 202F</li>
     <li>The gauge was reporting an oil temp of 185F</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     Sunday morning, we drove around a bit and then headed home to San Diego County. Would there be any sort of harm if I calibrated the gauge to what the sender is putting out? Or should I just leave it alone and get a Berg dipstick oil temp sender thingie.
