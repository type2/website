Hey people ...

        This past weekend was the ideal weekend to put my SunPro (electric) oil
gauge and sender (which is attached to the Gex 1776 via a "T" copper
fitting).  The weather was above 85 degrees.  I had mentioned in the last
post that I was thinking about going out to Riverside ... I kinda missed
that town and ended up in Las Vegas instead.  A friend of mine got a free
one night stay at the new casino "New York New York".
        We left Poway California around 5am PST and ended up in the city of Lost
Wages close to noon.  The weather was hot and dry.  It was in the low 90's
when we arrived.  It was rumored to hit as high as 98-99 by the afternoon.
        Anyhoot ... With the outside temp being in the 90's, here's the readings I
got:


                   At the "T" fitting: 190F
                   At the base of the dip stick tube: 193F
                   On the dipstick: 195F
                   On the block under the 009: 197F

                   ... with the engine off:

                   The oil on the dipstick: 195F
                   Sticking the probe down the tube: 202F

                    The gauge was reporting an oil temp of 185F

        Sunday morning, we drove around a bit and then headed home to San Diego
County.  Would there be any sort of harm if I calibrated the gauge to what
the sender is putting out?  Or should I just leave it alone and get a Berg
dipstick oil temp sender thingie.
