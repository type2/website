       Quoting Mike West:

       "Looking down from the intake side like they were on the engine, the adjusting screw center should be in the center of the valve stem.

       HUH?  I thought the valve stems are supposed to be off center to adjustors so the valve ROTATES as the adjustor bangs it (pushes it) and  thus

     Rocker geometry is set up so that (all) the adjuster(s) sit in the 'middle' of the valve stem with the valve at half-lift.  If you then rotate the cam you will see that the adjuster then moves over a wider surface of the valve stem as lift varies (rotating the valve)......the two variables you can adjust to alter your rocker geometry are rocker arm height (as Mike discusses) and/or pushrod length.  This will give you the longest life and most efficient operation of the upper valve train.  If you have the eye of a hawk you could do it 'by eye'.  Having the eye of a limulus I do it with a dial guage..
    </p>
    <p>
     Given the fly cutting, case facing etc that goes on, everyone should cast their eye over the rocker geometry of a rebuilt engine....
