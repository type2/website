Subject: Re: Valve Train Geometry, Theory meets M

Rocker geometry is set up so that (all) the adjuster(s) sit in the 'middle'
of the valve stem with the valve at half-lift.  If you then rotate the cam
you will see that the adjuster then moves over a wider surface of the valve
stem as lift varies (rotating the valve)......the two variables you can
adjust to alter your rocker geometry are rocker arm height (as Mike
discusses) and/or pushrod length.  This will give you the longest life and
most efficient operation of the upper valve train.  If you have the eye of
a hawk you could do it 'by eye'.  Having the eye of a limulus I do it with
a dial guage..

Given the fly cutting, case facing etc that goes on, everyone should cast
their eye over the rocker geometry of a rebuilt engine....
