Subject: German silver metallic paint

Just wanted to pass on a tip that a guy at the local VW shop (Save-A-Bug)
passed on to me.   German Silver Metallic paint looks very close to the
original bluish grey paint VW used on some of their parts.  In particular,
I'm referring to the luggage rack bars on my Westy roof.  But it's also on
the windshield wiper blade arms and a few other places.  Hopefully you all
understand the bluish grey I'm referring to.

A while back I was considering getting my luggage rack bars chromed because
they were rusty and I wanted them to look stock.  Instead, I sanded them
down, put a couple coats of Krylon grey primer, then a couple coats of the
German Silver Metallic, then a coat of Krylon Crystal Clear Acrylic coating.
 I must say I'm pleased with the results.  I'm ready to rivet my bars back on
the fiberglass shell and they look sharp.  We'll see how well they stand the
elements up there.

The Germal Silver Metallic is found in hobby stores and comes in 3 oz cans.
 I bought four cans at $3.30 ea.  The brand name I used was Model Master (The
Testor Corp.) and the color code number was 2914 German Silver.  To me this
is an inexpensive alternative to chroming and it's actually more correct as
far as stock configuration of my bus.
