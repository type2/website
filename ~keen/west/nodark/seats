 You're the one needs a winter project. We all all have full plates,
thank you.  :-)

 basically you need a seat about the same size . That's all.

 I do this in this guys van every time he wrecks one and get's
another. Corvair Greenbriar of all things.

 Comes with a full width of car seat.

 He goes and gets plush singles out of a Buick and will I help.

 Keep the vw seat bracket and slider.

 Set the seat in question in there.

 Now start fitting 2x4's and the like until you get it where you like it.

 Now go build a stand like that out of steel and drill holes for the
vw parts to bolt to it.

 Put a swivel in the middle so you can do a 360    :-)

 We look forward to hearing your report in the spring.   :-)
