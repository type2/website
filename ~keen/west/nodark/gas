  Not winter and "regular", winter and "summer".

 They refuse to give me the exact formulas, it may be because I
haven't asked yet.

 Do just a general look, where I live, it used to be you could get
100% gasoline in the summer.

 Warmer climes let it burn without too much smog.

 Then in the winter all the stations switched to "gasohol".

 It starts and burns easier but less poop and mileage.

 It's still that way but we have to have gasohol in the summer too
now.

 Still there is a summer and winter formulation that all oil companies
adhere to for the Air Quality bozos.

 They have only one concern and that's to lower emissions..

 Never mind if your car has less poop.

 In the case of your jets, it even has a different specific density.

 So if you're running on the edge say, of a rich condition, this
would push it over.

  It's no longer as warm as summer so your engine is colder on average,
colder air than summer and you now make short trps to school instead of long
runs to the beach or whatever.

 Just can't compare a summer setup with a winter setup.

 Too many things change.

 Set it up for max power in the winter and you'll probably be running too
lean again in the summer.

 I'm not a big track fan, but I understand those guys are out there
checking the air density and temps every morning and then betting
whether it will get hot or not when they do their jetting before the
race.

 That's just the air, they know what kind of fuel they have.

 Jeez Garret, let me out of here!
