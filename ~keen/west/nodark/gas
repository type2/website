      I can't talk on the carbs but there are two items that you're sliding over that keep you from comparing the "apples to the apples".
     </p>
     <p>
      You've changed driving habits now that you're back in school, and while you were doing that, the gas companies switched to "winter blend" gasoline.

      Um......could you explain to me the difference between winter gas and regular gas??? or are you trying to be funny ;)
     </p>
     <p>
      I wasn't aware that gas formulas change in the winter months....why?
     </p>
     <p>
      I bet you'll tell me :)

     Not winter and regular, winter and summer.
    </p>
    <p>
     They refuse to give me the exact formulas, it may be because I haven't asked yet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Do just a general look, where I live, it used to be you could get 100% gasoline in the summer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Warmer climes let it burn without too much smog.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then in the winter all the stations switched to gasohol.
    </p>
    <p>
     It starts and burns easier but less poop and mileage.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's still that way but we have to have gasohol in the summer too now.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still there is a summer and winter formulation that all oil companies adhere to for the Air Quality bozos.
    </p>
    <p>
     They have only one concern and that's to lower emissions..
    </p>
    <p>
     Never mind if your car has less poop.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the case of your jets, it even has a different specific density.
    </p>
    <p>
     So if you're running on the edge say, of a rich condition, this would push it over.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's no longer as warm as summer so your engine is colder on average, colder air than summer and you now make short trps to school instead of long runs to the beach or whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just can't compare a summer setup with a winter setup.
    </p>
    <p>
     Too many things change.
    </p>
    <p>
     Set it up for max power in the winter and you'll probably be running too lean again in the summer.
    </p>
    <p>
     I'm not a big track fan, but I understand those guys are out there checking the air density and temps every morning and then betting whether it will get hot or not when they do their jetting before the race.
    </p>
    <p>
     That's just the air, they know what kind of fuel they have.

     Jeez Garret, let me out of here!
