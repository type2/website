      <p>
       Do the new Beetles being built in Mexico have hydraulic lifters? More specifically, do the new engines for sale at the various parts places have hydraulic lifters? I am thinking about scrapping the engine to my '68 Bus and buying a new one if they have hydraulic lifters.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a little frightened to buy a rebuilt engine after reading the horror stories here. All comments are welcome.

      I had hoped someone more knowledgeable on these new engines would answer this.
     </p>
     <p>
      I'm not giving out any information but his initials are Kyle Wade.

      Horror stories: you know the difference between a fairy tale and a war story?
     </p>
     <p>
      One of them begins with “once upon a time” and the other with “this is no shit!”
     </p>
     <p>
      The fact is we are all here because we want control of our lives to be in “our” hands. Not some mechanic who hands you a bill for replacing the D.I.S.: $86, labor: $225.
     </p>
     <p>
      The fact is the only way any of us can afford to run one of these older cars is if we “do it ourselves”. Labor alone is just too much.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most war stories, albeit true for the most part, are caused by the owners ignorance. And down right neglect.
     </p>
     <p>
      Now look at a brand new engine from Mexico. Do you speak good Spanish?
     </p>
     <p>
      Do you have a local Dealer, to handle the bugs, etc. ?
     </p>
     <p>
      What good is a warranty then?
     </p>
     <p>
      Hydraulic lifters: I like them, but you can't just put them in and forget them any more than you can on any engine. Yes, several rebuilders make them with hydraulics, $150 more.
     </p>
     <p>
      Now let's put in a pointless ignition so we can stop having to do that too.
     </p>
     <p>
      Now you never have to look in the engine room again, right?
     </p>
     <p>
      It's almost true, but how many have spotted that loose hose or frayed belt or broken CV boot while doing the “routine maintenance”?
     </p>
     <p>
      Will you still change the oil as often?
     </p>
     <p>
      When was the last time you inspected your front end? That's on the other end of the car. :-)
     </p>
     <p>
      You ever had a “new car” warranty? They have you into the “Dealer” for regular check-ups at prices that will buy you another car.
     </p>
     <p>
      Now there's the silver lining story: I have a bug out here with an engine I didn't build (shudder) and have practically rebuilt.
     </p>
     <p>
      Still, once I got it tightened up and give it a monthly tune/check, just an hour or so, it runs like the much quoted “watch”.
     </p>
     <p>
      It's gone about 30k miles with no trouble at all and a total of around 50K. That's at least 3 years I've done nothing but change the oil, etc. Had a belt break. Damned girlfriend broke all the door handles. Had to get rid of her.
     </p>
     <p>
      I could head for Chicago tomorrow and expect to get there with no difficulty.
     </p>
     <p>
      You've heard I'm building another engine which was supposed to go in that bug but is now going in the van.
     </p>
     <p>
      This one I will know every bolt head by name.
     </p>
     <p>
      The only thing I can possibly have any doubts about are the parts I couldn't personally inspect. Like the crank.
     </p>
     <p>
      I have a good feel for that crank tho, it turns in there and fits those bearings etc. like I planned it that way.
     </p>
     <p>
      I still wish I'd put a counter balanced crank in but everything else is balanced so it should go a 100k miles with any luck at all.
     </p>
     <p>
      When an Irishman talks about luck, you best believe he hand carved it. Luck favors the efficient and always will.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bottom line: even if God herself came down and handed me a new engine I'd be suspicious and worry all the time.
     </p>
     <p>
      “You” can build a better engine than VW ever did. Go read Bob Hoovers Sermons.
     </p>
     <p>
      Let's not forget my own pile at Raistricks house! :-)
     </p>
     <p>
      That's all
