     Making a dummy jug.
    </p>
    <p>
     Somewhere in one of Bobs Sermons is reference to using a dummy jug. I can't find it but it's there.
    </p>
    <p>
     Like some of you, :-) I shined it on at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Probably in the &quot;free horsepower&quot;, I read those a lot. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     So what is it? Well it's an old jug you cleaned up and have used for several tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
     My first need was a cut on the sealing surface of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
     Had to get down in there and grind it out with lapping compound.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then I had to bring the rest of the surface down to that so I also have a dummy head that fits in the dummy jug.
    </p>
    <p>
     Put a push-rod on it for a handle and you have a four-0 lapping tool for the whole flat surface down in the combustion chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
     It might be called the &quot;poor boys fly-cutter&quot;.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then on my funky old case that looked like it had caught fire and they put it out with an axe and a sharp screw driver, I had to clean up the spigot surfaces with some more lapping.
    </p>
    <p>
     At this point you find they have a 3/8 wide sealing ring on the jug where it goes down in the hole. Have to take that down so the dummy jug will slip in without force.
    </p>
    <p>
     My third reason for having one has surfaced when I put all the long/short rods on in random fashion based on the silly premise that the rod should fit the crank.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yeah there's different size crank surfaces too, including width.
    </p>
    <p>
     Those damn tolerances we talked about. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     More in the rods than the crank.
    </p>
    <p>
     So I still need to check this whole mess against a standard length cylinder. One jug will have to be used in all four spigots to finalize the stack ups that show as deck height.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus one more use for the dummy jug.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once that's all &quot;spocked&quot; out I can determine the spacers and where each of my pistons go and where each of the jugs go.
    </p>
    <p>
     If I used one of the new ones I'd be pressing it in and prying it out of all four holes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Come to think of it I can use my dummy piston too.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wouldn't want to scratch my new ones.
    </p>
    <p>
     On lapping spigot faces: use some bluing first and see how the seal surface looks, if you have 80% and no cuts across it, leave it be. If you take some off one then take some off the other the same amount.
    </p>
    <p>
     Want to keep the head from being cocked.
    </p>
    <p>
     To make the dummy jug, you just have to take a few thousandths off the shoulder that slips into the spigot.
    </p>
    <p>
     Do it in a lathe if you're one of those but it has been done with a file or belt-stick by hand. Mine for instance.
    </p>
    <p>
     The only thing left is to paint it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe a nice high yellow to keep some oaf from lifting it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tape the lapping surfaces when it's being stored to prevent rash. Oil the bore maybe and store the dummy piston in it.
