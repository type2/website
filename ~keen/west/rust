    <p>
     I was off the net for a couple days...
    </p>
    <p>
     weather and pestilence etc.
    </p>
    <p>
     The one phone line out of Grants Pass got broke.
    </p>
    <p>
     I see you going thru all sorts of advice on how to get rid of rust and another on how to get the carbon out.
    </p>
    <p>
     I'll celebrate my return by revealing another Military Secret of how to do in rust and carbon.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the Navy we do what are called "Water sides" and "Fire sides" of boilers. Heavy rust and heavy soot/carbon deposits.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sodium Metasillicate pentahydrate and IGAPAL mixed with the baddest solvent around.
    </p>
    <p>
     This solvent will actually dissolve steel.
    </p>
    <p>
     It will dissolve rocks. It been known to reduce mountains into mole-hills.
    </p>
    <p>
     The chemical formula is H4O2 and I will be happy to send you buckets of the stuff for only $12.95 plus S&amp;H.
    </p>
    <p>
     The other stuff (sodium...) is an ionic surfactant which aids in the process of dissolution.
    </p>
    <p>
     To increase solubility and absorption you just add heat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now supplies are limited so send your cash today.
    </p>
    <p>
     If I get to short on the sodium meta... stuff, I'll do what we used to do in the gun and canoe club.
    </p>
    <p>
     Run down and buy some Trisodium Phosphate.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another good formula was the solvent and Citric Acid.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you use the citric, when you dump the solvent, you have to rinse much much right now. This will coat the bare steel molecules with a layer of hydrogen.
    </p>
    <p>
     The above was for the water sides and rust.
    </p>
    <p>
     For the fire sides and carbon we just used hot solvent and let it dissolve the steel under the carbon and it would peel right off.
    </p>
    <p>
     Carbon is a tuffy even for the universal solvent. Six bonds are hard to break. It will dissolve but very slow. Even better with the surfactant.
    </p>
    <p>
     The addition of heat makes all this happen fairly rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
     For those of you too poor to send me your money and this does not apply to you stingy dudes, just use soap and water.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wait till I tell your mother you didn't know that soap and water were the best solvent in the world for rust and carbon.
    </p>
    <p>
     How do you heat the water? Well I used to stick a steam hose in it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not too handy at your house? Well build a fire under the thing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rinse well when you're finished and dry soon.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, water does not make rust. Oxygen makes rust.
    </p>

     west only gone 2 days, mumble mumble...
