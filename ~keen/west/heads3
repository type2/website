Subject: Head heights on Ol'Thrasher

 I finally got out in the shop and spocked out the head height of
the four cylinders with my yellow dummy head and a dummy piston.

 The left bank is within .002"(.05mm) of each other and the right
side is within .005"(.125mm).

 The rest is pure Irish, the low one is .012" (.3mm) from the high one.  #3
and # 2 respectively. The right bank is 6-1/2 mils (.1625mm) higher than the
left on average.

 It only takes .014" (.35mm) to make 2CC's with these 1641 jugs.

 I could shift the rods around and get the right bank together but it
would make the left bank even worse.

 So I still have my long and short other parts plus some major diff.
in the heads to play with.

 Then I can always polish the spacers a few mils , I may even do some more
lapping of the spigot faces.

 It will be alright and within 1 CC by the time I'm done but if I had
to go after .1 CC, I'd quit.

 Using old parts has been a unique learning experience.

 Not one I would ever care to repeat.

 I will never use another set of crap heads rebuilt by anyone.
