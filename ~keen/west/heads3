     I finally got out in the shop and spocked out the head height of the four cylinders with my yellow dummy head and a dummy piston.
    </p>
    <p>
     The left bank is within .002" (.05mm) of each other and the right side is within .005" (.125mm).
    </p>
    <p>
     The rest is pure Irish, the low one is .012" (.3mm) from the high one. #3 and #2 respectively. The right bank is 6-1/2 mils (.1625mm) higher than the left on average.
    </p>
    <p>
     It only takes .014" (.35mm) to make 2CC's with these 1641 jugs.
    </p>
    <p>
     I could shift the rods around and get the right bank together but it would make the left bank even worse.
    </p>
    <p>
     So I still have my long and short other parts plus some major diff. in the heads to play with.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then I can always polish the spacers a few mils, I may even do some more lapping of the spigot faces.
    </p>
    <p>
     It will be alright and within 1 CC by the time I'm done but if I had to go after .1 CC, I'd quit.
    </p>
    <p>
     Using old parts has been a unique learning experience.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not one I would ever care to repeat.
    </p>
    <p>
     I will never use another set of crap heads rebuilt by anyone.
