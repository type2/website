     Doin' a crank . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     Actually more of a visit to 3 of them . .
    </p>
    <p>
     A stock type 1/2/3 (1600 engine)
    </p>
    <p>
     A stock type 4 . . the later van engine 1700/ - - /2000 engines
    </p>
    <p>
     The last is a type 1 counter-weighted crank . . Bugpack. .  welded.<br/>
     There is always that question of "what it is? and do I need it?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Looking at the stock crank(t1), I do regret there are no pictures.<br/>
     Still I will try to do this with words . .
    </p>
    <p>
     I went down and borrowed a scale . . like a bathroom scale  . .<br/>
     Put my 25 pound barbell on it for a calibration check . . ok . .
    </p>
    <p>
     A stock type1, 69mm crank weighs in at 19 lb.<br/>
     The gears weigh another pound . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     The 74mm counter-weighted crank weighs in at 21 lb. bare . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     Note: there are good photos and some real good data in Bill Fisher's<br/>
     book "How to hot-rod vw engines" . . that CW crank in there looks a<br/>
     lot nicer than the one I have . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     The van crank, a 66mm stock job weighed 22 lb bare, 23 w/gears . .
    </p>
    <p>
     A stock 12 volt, 200mm flywheel weighs 16-1/2 lb. less than I had thought.<br/>
     That's a type 1/2/3 flywheel for the non-gear-heads . .
    </p>
    <p>
     I went out and drug the one off the t4 engine in here . . 210 mm<br/>
     weighs 14-1/2 lb . .   not at all what I expected . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     Giving these cranks a visual . . it's my eye . . YMMV . . :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     The stock 1600 crank while forged by definition is only partly forged.<br/>
     You can see both forging marks and cast surfaces in various spots . .
    </p>
    <p>
     The CW crank I have here kind of worries me . . one spot even has raised<br/>
     letters cast on it . . pretty hard for me to see this as anything but cast.<br/>
     I assume it is a partial forging like the stock .
    </p>
    <p>
     The type 4 engine crank is a beauty tho, no cast marks anywhere and most<br/>
     surfaces forged to finished condition . . a true forging as far as I'm<br/>
     concerned . .
    </p>
    <p>
     Let's cover the counter-weight thing . .
    </p>
    <p>
     This counter-weight is put in a place that makes every conn-rod journal<br/>
     balanced within itself. It eliminates a bending  moment that was there<br/>
     before . . in so doing it also removes some harmonics from happening.
    </p>
    <p>
     Those are bad things for your bearings and crank and on thru to your case.
    </p>
    <p>
     The fact that it adds a couple pounds to the crank is actually to the good<br/>
     in one manner . . it transmits a smoother load to the flywheel . .
    </p>
    <p>
     This makes it easier on the crank/flywheel connection plus more ease to the<br/>
     bearings . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     The negative is, by definition, horse power has a time element so any<br/>
     added mass to the shaft is a loss of hp. So you lighten the flywheel.
    </p>
    <p>
     None of the above is for street . . it's for getting off the line.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fisher's book says a stock crank is good up to 5000 rpm . . suggests putting<br/>
     a rev-limiter on if your carbs are too big . .
    </p>
    <p>
     It isn't mentioned but while a limit on rpm is apparent so is fast wind-up.<br/>
     What I mean there, is if you have some big pistons in there and stand on the<br/>
     throttle for a nice wheelie . . you can bend that crank big time . .
    </p>
    <p>
     So if you have a heavy foot even in a 1600 engine, it would be to your<br/>
     advantage to have a CW crank . .
    </p>
    <p>
     What I have on Balancing: damn little . . :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     My local guy says he balances to 1/10th gram at 850 rpm . .
    </p>
    <p>
     I have a definite maybe that he is talking of a centimeter-gram which is<br/>
     what the Bentley Manual speaks of.<br/>
     The stock crank specs at 12 cm-g max.<br/>
     Stock flywheel (1600) is 20 cmg as it writes it . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     Max what?   it gives no rpm so it could be interpreted at max rpm. .<br/>
     Never happen joe . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     What the hell is he talking about? you say . . .  :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     A centimeter-gram is like an inch-ounce as far as I know . . put a gram out<br/>
     on the end of a 1cm lever arm . . .<br/>
     Why . . . ! . . .  ? we're talking of dynamics here . . something moving .
    </p>
    <p>
     It has to have a direction or vector . .  one of you teachers can explain<br/>
     this better . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     Now to the machine that is doing the work balancing this pig it is a reading<br/>
     at the bearings it's turning on in a location that rotates with the shaft. 3<br/>
     or 4 pressure sensors mounted around the bearing . .
    </p>
    <p>
     It resolves the heavy spot into a location relative to the start point and<br/>
     can then point that place out to the operator on the shaft circle.<br/>
     It also tells him how much of course . .
    </p>
    <p>
     One or more have asked can you statically balance like a bicycle wheel?
    </p>
    <p>
     In theory you can . . get a couple extreme knife edges and set them up<br/>
     flat and parallel and level with the  earths bulges and then if you have a<br/>
     balance you can spin it on the bearing surfaces and it will stay where it<br/>
     stops every time and doesn't stop in the same place etc.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then by sticking some small weights like coins and tape on the light side,<br/>
     that's the side pointing up, you could achieve some kind of balance.
    </p>
    <p>
     I don't think it's such a good idea tho . . . .<br/>
     It's only $35 to have it done right and I wouldn't even trust me on this one.<br/>
     Don't think I'd do it with a bicycle wheel if I had options . .
    </p>
    <p>
     Are the counter-weights necessary to really balance the crank? . . . ?
    </p>
    <p>
     Not at all . . it balanced in all planes before and in fact the<br/>
     counter-weights are put on such that they zero out  each other on the shaft<br/>
     . . ie. 2 on one side and 2 at 180 degrees.
    </p>
    <p>
     I'm going to break this off and do a second one on the monkey-motion<br/>
     of the crank.  . . .
