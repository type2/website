     Anyway, the two critical areas in Electronic Fuel Injection are fuel delivery<br/>
     and information feedback.  Systems like the Berg Haltech and CB Performance<br/>
     system require in the car tuning sessions or mounted dials and switches<br/>
     to compensate for the lack of feedback to the system.  This has the advantage<br/>
     of custom tuning to the drivers preferences, however the best advice would<br/>
     be to use the sensors that were intended with the system.  I myself have<br/>
     done a few experiments with Rabbit EFI systems on a Type I motor.  It works<br/>
     great.  But when you start getting into bigger motors, fuel flow and delivery<br/>
     become critical, i.e., injectors start getting too small and the fuel<br/>
     pump can't keep up with the demand (of course using a stock electric fuel<br/>
     pump).  Last one I did was a Turbo application in a Sandrail, the EFI was<br/>
     "free", but we wound up putting about $400 in upgrades, new lines, new pump<br/>
     bigger injectors.  We also went through about three different O2 Sensors<br/>
     that would work with the higher exhaust manifold temp that the turbo produced.

     But it did and still does work.  This thing (1776, Berg Crank, VW Rods) with<br/>
     the Turbo roosts for days, Boost is limited to 10 PSI, but it doesn't ping<br/>
     and is very responsive.  I have a couple of Rabbit systems still hanging<br/>
     around here, I think I'm going to do some more experiments this winter.  Maybe<br/>
     a 1600 but with higher boost characteristics.  I have a Mitus. Turbo that I<br/>
     bought at a recent swap - $75  - Woohoo instant low buck power.

     BTW, you're still working with an Aircooled Platform here, so heat dissapation<br/>
     and how much fun you can have depends upon your willingness to let the<br/>
     engine operate within effective cooling parameters.  A Turbo on an Aircooled<br/>
     VW Engine will overheat the engine, very quickly.  The difference betwen<br/>
     a couple of pounds of boost can me intake charge temps soar, so heat in =<br/>
     heat stored = not so much heat out.  I also use intercoolers.  (find them<br/>
     out of old trashed saabs or Volvos..).
