    <p>
     I'm going to write this bit about the crankshaft<br/>
     for the newbie . . maybe that's me . . :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     First, do you have one? . . open the engine compartment<br/>
     with the engine running . . see those wheels and stuff<br/>
     going round and round ? . . . keep things you're fond of<br/>
     away from them . . :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     The generator (or alternator) is that round doo-dah on the<br/>
     upper end of what we refer to as the "fan-belt" . . .<br/>
     at the bottom of the fan-belt loop is what we call the<br/>
     "crank-pulley" . . . it is hanging off the end of crankshaft.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ok . . looking at that lower pulley, which by the way is<br/>
     where the timing marks are for tuning, you can locate the<br/>
     one end of the crankshaft . .
    </p>
    <p>
     At the opposite end of the engine . . up front, is the<br/>
     flywheel/clutch setup . . the flywheel is pinned and bolted<br/>
     to the far end of the crankshaft . . . if you have an<br/>
     automatic tranny, that's where the torque converter is<br/>
     instead of a flywheel . .
    </p>
    <p>
     Between the crank-pulley you're looking at and the flywheel<br/>
     end you're visualizing, the crankshaft runs thru the engine<br/>
     directly in line with the piston jugs "up and down" and<br/>
     "side to side" . . . two planes of alignment . .
    </p>
    <p>
     When they talk about "align-boring" or "line-boring", this<br/>
     is the relation-ship that's being referred to . .<br/>
     Specifically, there are 4 journal bearings that hold the<br/>
     crankshaft in place, thus aligning the crank itself with<br/>
     the pistons . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     Do I need one? . . . yeah . . this is where all the monkey<br/>
     motion of the entire engine comes together and the engine's<br/>
     power is pumped into the flywheel, et al . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     What is a crank?    A crank is defined as a device that<br/>
     translates a reciprocating motion into a rotary motion.<br/>
     The reverse is also true . .  :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     From the Starter's point of view, it converts the rotary<br/>
     motion of the starter to a reciprocating motion at the<br/>
     pistons to get the first fires lit . .
    </p>
    <p>
     Once the engine is running, the pistons are making the power<br/>
     and that is translated and communicated down thru the cranks<br/>
     to the main shaft where  it is transmitted to the flywheel.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is a crank for each piston so there are four of them<br/>
     on the crankshaft . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     This crank thing . . remember your bicycle sprocket? that's<br/>
     a crank also . . think of each leg as a piston. . .<br/>
     Now lose the sprocket and send the drive power out thru<br/>
     the shaft instead . .
    </p>
    <p>
     In addition to the connections at the flywheel and<br/>
     crank-pulley, there are 2 gears on the main crankshaft that<br/>
     drive the cam-shaft gear and the distributor drive gear.<br/>
     These are inside so can't be seen . .
    </p>
    <p>
     While these two internal gears on the crankshaft do draw some<br/>
     power, their main purpose in both cases is to turn some other<br/>
     device that makes the valves open on time and the dizzy spark<br/>
     to get there at just the right time in the combustion<br/>
     chambers of the pistons. . .
    </p>
    <p>
     That cam-shaft gear I spoke of, right in the end of it's<br/>
     center is the drive-shaft for the oil pump too . .<br/>
     another mouth to feed . . :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     I should mention "Stroke". . another term you'll hear. . .<br/>
     That is the length of that lever-arm on the crank times 2<br/>
     for a complete revolution . . the piston is moved the full<br/>
     length of the "stroke".  ie. the 1600 engine has a 69 mm<br/>
     stroke in stock form . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     To "stroke" an engine means to put a longer than stock<br/>
     stroked crank in . . ie. I mention a 74mm crank, you can get<br/>
     them on up to what?, 82 mm or so for the type1 engine . .<br/>
     There are a few stroker cranks for the type4's but the price<br/>
     is pretty rare too . .
    </p>
    <p>
     When you "stroke" an engine, you are increasing the<br/>
     displacement of the engine . . [stroke X bore = disp]
    </p>
    <p>
     I cover the generals of the "Counterweighted crank" in the<br/>
     post on "cranks, flywheels , weights" etc., .
    </p>
    <p>
     I'm going to add one more weight on this post . . 1-1/2 lbs.
    </p>
    <p>
     That's the weight of a stock pressed-steel crank-pulley<br/>
     of a type 1 engine . . I don't care for my scale tho . .<br/>
     it is the 100 lb floor scale . . it's not too accurate at<br/>
     the 1-1/2 lb range . .
    </p>
    <p>
     If you want to get even more involved with crankshafts, I<br/>
     mentioned a couple references in the "weights" post . .
    </p>
    <p>
     If you want the best possible advice on how to set up and<br/>
     "bed" your crank into your case go get into Hoover's "Sermons"
    </p>
    <p>
     I will continue to tout "rebuild your air-cooled VW" by<br/>
     Tom Wilson for a better understanding and any rebuild work.
    </p>
    <p>
     well . . I think that's it . .   :-)
