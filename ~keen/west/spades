     Road Kill electronics and spade connectors...
    </p>
    <p>
     Woke up this morning and my computer wouldn't work.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whacked it a few times... it still wouldn't budge.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What's different from last nite?" say I. "It's cold", says three or four appendages.
    </p>
    <p>
     Brain goes on a tangent how that may impede the flow of electrons.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Get real" sayeth the Forebrain to the Lizard section.
    </p>
    <p>
     Spocking it out... there's power lights at the power strip, so I know it's getting that far.
    </p>
    <p>
     I get down and jiggle all the connectors etc. Still no joy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Throw a small hissy fit... wipe the foam and drool from my face I get down and go at it scientifically.
    </p>
    <p>
     I have one of the "Mega Universe" power strips with $30k insured surge protectors... even my phone goes thru it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Being such a "bad ol' thing", it has more connections than I have equipment. I pulled the computer plug out and moved it to another plug-in.
    </p>
    <p>
     Everything works fine.
    </p>
    <p>
     So what happened and how come I'm wearing gloves while I type?
    </p>
    <p>
     It's cold in here and my fingers get numb hanging out there in the wind of my blinding typing speed.
    </p>
    <p>
     I could warm it up but I have to go change bottles on the propane etc.
    </p>
    <p>
     By that time I'd be warmed up and not need it...
    </p>
    <p>
     It promotes hair growth and long life.
    </p>
    <p>
     Unfortunately it doesn't seem to do much for the head portion.
    </p>
    <p>
     Putting aside the personal discomforts and rationalizations,
    </p>
    <p>
     What happened is that the damn plug corroded.
    </p>
    <p>
     AC voltage is not noted for it but it do happen, a lot of moisture helps. We have had some moisture. Also hot and then cold helps.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moisture and other stuff is pulled in by the temp. changes and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
     Those of you who normally carry a firearm know about this.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ammo that will keep for years in a box will go to hell in your gun in just a few months from being carried out in the heat and then back into an air-conditioned office. Or vice versa.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sucks moisture right in there.
    </p>
    <p>
     So I said AC (alternating current) is not noted for this. AC is reversing the current 60 times per second and doesn't really have a "flow" in one direction for plating out a connection.
    </p>
    <p>
     DC (direct current) does. It always flows in one direction and therefore has what's referred to as "electrolytic action".
    </p>
    <p>
     Put a little moisture in the equation and you're plating part "A" with the metal from part"B".
    </p>
    <p>
     Stick some soot in the equation and you have even more problems.
    </p>
    <p>
     Carbon has 6 valences or little hands to grab stuff with, that's why it's such bitchin' stuff to make things out of.
    </p>
    <p>
     When was the last time you switched spade connectors?
    </p>
    <p>
     OK we don't do that, don't even go down there any more.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still, if it's a plug-in, it needs cleaned every few months or it is creating resistance in your electrical system.
    </p>
    <p>
     To clean a spade or plug connector, the simpest way is to "pump" it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pull it apart and back together a few times. "Pump it"
    </p>
    <p>
     This wears a clean new path thru any corrosion, restoring good contact.
    </p>
    <p>
     If it's a ground screwed to metal, the corrosion is generally under the terminal next to the metal part.
    </p>
    <p>
     We don't think much of "grounds", did you know the electrons actually flow from the "negative" to the "positive"?
    </p>
    <p>
     Pull the screw and clean under there, then re-tighten.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dab it with some vaseline on top to keep away moisture etc.
    </p>
    <p>
     That does not mean grease all your connectors, the grease is a non-conductor like corrosion.
    </p>
    <p>
     Permanent connections: splices etc. these should be soldered or they will just go bad in a while.
    </p>
    <p>
     Use the butt connector, say, and crimp it in but then whip out your little torch and solder the thing in.
    </p>
    <p>
     All the electricians tape in the world won't keep out moisture or prevent electolytic action.
    </p>
    <p>
     You want a good seal around that splice, get a piece of shrink sleeving, pull it over the connection after you've soldered, then put a good sealant inside the ends of the sleeve, then shrink it down over the connection.
    </p>
    <p>
     Do not use RTV silicone as an insulator on bare wire. The ascorbic acid it uses to cure with, eats the hell out of copper.
    </p>
    <p>
     And if you do have reason to go down to that part of town...
    </p>
    <p>
     Swap out your ammo and pump your connectors. It could save the life of someone very close to you. :-)
