   <article>
    <p>
     I suppose I should preface this with my curriculum vitae . .
    </p>
    <p>
     The only FI system I own is in a box under the work bench.
    </p>
    <p>
     I have poked at a couple, even cured one . . stuck air flap.<br/>
     Most of the time it's an air leak or clogged injector. . .
    </p>
    <p>
     Then I send them down to a local place I know where they have<br/>
     some decent equipment and expertise.
    </p>
    <p>
     Read a book or two . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      maybe this should be called "Science Fiction"
    </p>
    <p>
     Carburetion is defined in my College Dictionary as:<br/>
     " the process of metering air and fuel to an engine intake<br/>
     system in the proper proportions for combustion".
    </p>
    <p>
     So a Fuel Injection system is a "Carburetor".
    </p>
    <p>
     Based on that, I wrote that piece on "Fuel Injection is Fun!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Some guy recently wrote to me about that article . . .<br/>
     Said he has a '79 with FI and what would I do to get more<br/>
     "performance" out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     I told him that as I have been lead to believe, the FI system<br/>
     he has is the best performer he can buy for that engine.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is supposed to be a wider band of torque thru the entire<br/>
     power curve. . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     I suggested he cherry out the FI and jack a fresh engine under<br/>
     it, then get back to me . . . . .   :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     The same is true in all cases, what good a big ass carb on a<br/>
     sick engine? Or vice versa?
    </p>
    <p>
     Based on his question and some stuff in my head, you get<br/>
     another article of dubious value . . . :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     How we're going to "hot-rod" FI.
    </p>
    <p>
     Let's take a "virtual" look at one:
    </p>
    <p>
     The first thing you notice is it's butt ugly . . . . :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     Let's face it, there is no pride in the product even. . .
    </p>
    <p>
     There is no polished aluminum or chrome, looks about as functional<br/>
     in the box as it does on the engine.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is no comparison to a set of dual carbs and linkage . :-)<br/>
     You can intuit that those babies do mean stuff. . :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     Throttle body injection still looks cool, it's just a carb<br/>
     with an injector in place of all the needle valves.
    </p>
    <p>
     This was the logical step after the "needle jet" carb.
    </p>
    <p>
     What they had to have, was a way to put the heat sensor and the<br/>
     O2 sensor in the loop so your engine could be tuned "on the<br/>
     fly".
    </p>
    <p>
     Our modern day setup where the injector is in the intake<br/>
     manifold and points at the intake valve is called the "Tuned<br/>
     port injection" I think.
    </p>
    <p>
     I would imagine this was found necessary when they had to put<br/>
     the Exhaust Gas Recirculation system in . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     The "TPI", as I refer to it above, is reputed to give a better<br/>
     "Volumetric efficiency" meaning it can get more fuel in the<br/>
     cylinder to burn than the throttle body type.
    </p>
    <p>
     The injectors in the TPI sit right in the intake manifold tho<br/>
     and are subject to high heat and vibration . . .  Woe . .
    </p>
    <p>
     Here's what I have in mind for the box under the workbench . .
    </p>
    <p>
     It's the complete FI system from a '83 2 liter flat four.
    </p>
    <p>
     I'm going to build a 1904 cc out of a type 1 and strap that<br/>
     FI system on it.
    </p>
    <p>
     I haven't checked the numbers but I think even the injectors<br/>
     will work.
    </p>
    <p>
     If they are too big, I'll get some smaller ones.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is a table floating around on the net giving fuel qty and time<br/>
     etc. with part numbers so it should be no big deal.
    </p>
    <p>
     I mentioned the cheat on the O2 sensor, or was it the temp sensor?<br/>
     I can use these to change any value in the system I want.<br/>
     Stick a potentiometer in the line and have my way with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      My intent is to leave the O2 sensor alone so it reads correct.<br/>
     Using that value, I change the value of the temp sensor to read low<br/>
     which tells the brain to give me longer bursts of fuel.
    </p>
    <p>
     Might still have to dink with the O2 sensor if it gets to fighting<br/>
     with me. I could still get an accurate reading . . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     I could rig this to read and be adjusted from the dash, same as one of<br/>
     "Claudes Buggies"&amp; Performance. I don't want to.
    </p>
    <p>
      I may have a gage on the O2 sense for a while till I get it<br/>
     tweeked.
    </p>
    <p>
     I need to think on this some more but basically I'd size the injectors<br/>
     such that they would handle my highest rpm fuel requirement.<br/>
     The idle has to be kept in mind also.
    </p>
    <p>
     I just sneaked a peek at Bruce Bowlings Program for sizing injectors<br/>
     and thats all that it does. He give the algorithim of the program<br/>
     for us physicists. . :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     Now if this guy who wanted to tweek his 1600 rig built a big<br/>
     engine to go under his FI, he would have some slightly<br/>
     different problems . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     He has a system with an air box and throttle body for a 1600<br/>
     engine . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     So he'd have to round up a bigger air box etc. . . . maybe . . .<br/>
     Maybe just a bigger Throttle Valve which is really an air valve.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sizing the throttle valve should be on the same order as sizing a venturi,<br/>
     still have to pull a vacuum for various reasons.<br/>
     Probably grab one off a 1.8 liter bus. . .
    </p>
    <p>
     Also bigger injectors but he can size those off Bowling . .
    </p>
    <p>
     I don't see any need to ever change out his Brain. . .
    </p>
    <p>
     The brain gets it's main signal from the distributor/coil . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     So he gets an air box off a 2 liter Pinto . . . . no biggy . .
    </p>
    <p>
     As long as it uses a flapper with a potentiometer on it, it can<br/>
     be adjusted. Or some similarity . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     I'll stop here briefly and elucidate, whatever that means. . .
    </p>
    <p>
     The flap on the air mass sensor or air box is tied to an arm which<br/>
     sweeps across a potentiometer(variable resistor) and gives a reading<br/>
     between 100 and 300 ohms. . .  just a ferinstance, ymmv. . .
    </p>
    <p>
     This reading is piped over to the brain where it tells the brain in<br/>
     voltage, how much air is coming thru there.<br/>
     This number is averaged by the brain and sent on to the fuel pulse<br/>
     sender. This pulse guy reads the value and adjusts the pulse to the<br/>
     injectors to give the right amount of fuel for stoich. ratio.
    </p>
    <p>
     The pulse guy is also tied to the coil, so he knows When to send the<br/>
     fuel out. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     This is checked by the O2 sensor when the smoke comes out the tailpipe<br/>
     and if it's good, it leaves things alone. If it's not so good, the<br/>
     O2 sensor sends a signal back that is part of the value the brain<br/>
     was averaging in the first place. . . the value is increased or decreased<br/>
     and the new value is fed to the injector pulse guy. . .
    </p>
    <p>
     So if you don't like the way things are working, you take the bull<br/>
     by the tail and Lie to the brain . . . .  :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     This particular lie is accomplished by putting a potentiometer in the<br/>
     line to the brain from the flapper potentiometer.<br/>
     Now you adjust the pot to tell the brain it isn't really getting that<br/>
     much air or it's getting more than it really is, depending on which<br/>
     way you want to go on this thing.<br/>
     The brain accepts that value and adjusts accordingly. You dog, you!
    </p>
    <p>
     Other lies may be told by doing a similar deed to the temp sense and<br/>
     the O2 sensor. . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     You don't like the pinto air box, build your own, some percentage larger<br/>
     from sheet or tube aluminum . . now we're starting to make it<br/>
     pretty!<br/>
      Stick a pot from Radio Shack on the thing and get whatever you like.<br/>
     Same for that throttle body . . it's just a butterfly valve.<br/>
     Nothing electric about it, unless you count the switch that cuts out<br/>
     the EGR at full throttle. Has a small screw that lets you by-pass the<br/>
     valve and bleed air thru for idle. . .
    </p>
    <p>
     As mentioned before, we should be able to cop parts off other<br/>
     makes of cars as long as we understand the principles.
    </p>
    <p>
     Say this guy builds a 1776, probably still use the same cold-<br/>
     start valve and auxilliary air valve  . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     Decel valve, probably still work, haven't looked into it . .
    </p>
    <p>
     Fuel pressure would still be alright, at some point you might<br/>
     need a bigger pump tho I've heard the bottle neck is the size<br/>
     of the fuel lines themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
     The "fuel ring", steel tubing that carries the fuel to the injectors<br/>
     is usually a two piece thing so that would be no problem. . .
    </p>
    <p>
     Saw a "bad" looking Electric Turbo-charger Fan the other day.<br/>
     This could be incorporated. . . .   :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     More performance stuff would be getting your injectors balanced.
    </p>
    <p>
     I see an outfit on the net, you send them five or six and they<br/>
     send you four of them back perfectly balanced for volume/pulse-<br/>
     width or some such.   Hi teck stuff , , ,
    </p>
    <p>
     There are also companies already out there that want to sell<br/>
     you a better injector, better spray pattern they say. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     There is one possible problem with the Stock Brain, it may<br/>
     have a limit on the rpm.  Like, it may not go to ten grand .
    </p>
    <p>
     Me personally, I have to stay somewhat lower than that, I don't<br/>
     have gears to really use that kind of horsepower which is rpm.
    </p>
    <p>
     I'd need that 5 speed gear box.
    </p>
    <p>
     At this point you could go to the CB Performance which uses a<br/>
     programmable ROM chip. . . . big bucks but you're obviously a racer.
    </p>
    <p>
     We probably better put the CDI ignition in too . . .you knew that . .
    </p>
    <p>
     The FI systems are getting better performance if you can believe any<br/>
     of the data that is out there. . .
    </p>
    <p>
     I have no data on  TBI vs TPI but it stands to reason that "VE" is<br/>
     a fact and that weighs heavy. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     The TPI, where the injectors are right in the header, looks to me<br/>
     like it might eat injectors. . . put little finned heat sinks on 'em.
    </p>
    <p>
     Get a shop coat and a tie and go around mumbling things like<br/>
     "pulse width" and "laminar flow". . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     That and a thick wallet will have the girls swarming. .  :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     Now we need a chrome air filter . . . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     west     pushing back the dark  . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have comments like I'm totally wrong about some part of this<br/>
     well lay them on me. I'll need to correct them anyway.  :-)
