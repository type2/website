      <p>
       How often? I say 5,000 miles is reasonable (a modern Toyota supposedly needs oil change at 7,000 miles or so) but it seems some believe every 1,500 or so is necessary or the engine will be at risk, even with modern oils. Is German iron that different from Japanese? What's reasonable? Cheers...

      Art, It's the old guy who never shut's up. :-)

      There's a story going 'round that the new extended oil changes was not brought on by some revolutionary break-through in the never ending fight against friction, but because when the prices went up to where a car became an investment, they needed to show how low the operating costs were per year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Then many years ago a factory Rep from which-ever Oil Co. told me 3000 miles or every 30 days because oxidation was as bad as useage.
     </p>
     <p>
      Now I've heard 3000 or 3 months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Then there's the story I read recently of the little old lady who had her oil changed every 1200 miles which was how often she had a tune-up in months.
     </p>
     <p>
      The car when taken down for some repair was found to have almost no wear. How old it was I don't recall.
     </p>
     <p>
      Then there's the mechanic, practically all, who say that's where all the bad stuff ends up. Carbon, dirt, metal flakes etc.
     </p>
     <p>
      Then there's the off-road racer who says "every time we stop for a new air-filter".
     </p>
     <p>
      Lastly, how long will it be before some other part on the engine breaks first. No sense worrying about bearings and the like if it blows a head etc. and you do a complete rebuild.
     </p>
     <p>
      The type 4 engine does have an oil filter, that's a plus over the type 1's. If it's lucky you still use an air filter.
     </p>
     <p>
      So what are your driving conditions, how's your income and how long do you want to keep the engine running?
     </p>
     <p>
      Detroit and Toyota are only interested in the first five years.
     </p>
     <p>
      The call is always yours.
