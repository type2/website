      Notice the title? I'm bucking for "Archive" here babe.

      While you fashion hounds were debating the "political correctness" of "Orange Stool" and measuring your curtains, I was studiously reading a book called " Basic Cams, Valves &amp; Exhaust Systems".
    </p>
    <p>
      Hydraulic vs Solid Lifter Cams: They don't want to talk about it.
    </p>
    <p>
     The most I could gather is that the Solid has a brief flat spot before "ramping" again. It seems to need this to "catch up with itself", then the word "Valve-Lash". You don't want to know.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the Hydraulic lifter, having its self-correcting "zero back-lash", it can start to "ramp" at once. So they do.
    </p>
    <p>
     If this is all there is to it, then it sounds like you could use hydraulic lifters on a "solid" cam but not the other way around.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You first". :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     The book was published in "74, talks about how you just go tell your "Cam-grinder" what your tire diameter and final gearing was and he'd grind to put your max torque there.
    </p>
    <p>
     I wish I had lived in those days.
    </p>
    <p>
     Valve clearance: The .004" to .006" to the .006"in/.008"exh.
    </p>
    <p>
     First, it was determined by VW that the max expansion of all "the goodies" worked out to .004" at standard operating temperatures.
    </p>
    <p>
     The intake valve is always being cooled by incoming fuel/air.
    </p>
    <p>
     The exhaust on the other hand is always being "heated" by gasses as high as 1600 degrees. It may attain temperatures of 1300-1400 degrees at the tulip/stem.
    </p>
    <p>
     This old book talks about the new-fangled "stainless valves".
    </p>
    <p>
     It seems they have a 40% greater "expansion rate" than the old "steel" valves. Remember the "leaded gas"?
    </p>
    <p>
     Forty perecent of .004" is 1.6 mil round to two. Ergo the .006.
    </p>
    <p>
     Experience probably got them to go to .008" on the exhaust in the bigger engines, ie the type 4.
    </p>
    <p>
     This also might apply to those running "big bore" or even "California Lean" type 1's.
    </p>
    <p>
     The only way I can think of to get the real "skinny" on your own engine would be a "hot compression test".
    </p>
    <p>
     "You first".  :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     There is more, if you run solid lifters "sloppy" you'll increase your "low end" torque. Always with the sacrifice to your "high end".
    </p>
    <p>
     The reverse is also true. Meaning running "tight" will increase "high end" with a sacrifice in "low end".
    </p>
    <p>
     In closing I'd like to say I hope this "technical stuff" bugs you "Interior Decorators" as much as your damned Curtains bug me.  :-)
