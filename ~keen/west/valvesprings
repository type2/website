 Well . . . . . .

 I ended up getting a couple fair springs from a furniture repair shop.

 They are the coil spring for the back of some chair.

 Basically they are 1" in diameter, and just under 2" long.

 The big difference is the wire diameter is less that 1/16"

 Take your spring and the retainer cap when you go to pick one out.

 I have since decided that in a pinch I could even use an oil relief
 valve spring from the V-dub.

 The criteria are:  has to go over the valve stem . . .


 has to compress 0.400" after installed . . . with your fingers.

 Take a look at the valve assy with the spring removed, there are
several shoulders of different diameters where the spring can sit.

 If you just want to hold the valves halfway open, cut a spacer out
of a piece of plastic pipe the right length and let the valve assy,
less spring sit on that. You'll have to slit the side of the spacer
so it can be installed with the retainer cap in place.
