       Howdy.<br/>
       I&#x27;m wondering, should be running velocity stacks on the 40 IDF&#x27;s on<br/>
       this 1835?  I&#x27;ve been told yes and no?  What are the pro&#x27;s and cons?<br/>
       <br/>
       Insight?

      Give you a couple reasons I have read about, one of the sources is Berg, I<br/>
      think.
     </p>
     <p>
      First a physical law thing: with a funnel you can get more air in there<br/>
      than without due to the sharp transition of the edge of the<br/>
      carb mouth. That sharp edge is a pressure drop and probably cuts the<br/>
      effective throat size by quite a bit. Turbulent flow versus Laminar.
     </p>
     <p>
      The second reason is the one I attribute to Berg: he says that there<br/>
      is a cloud of fuel vapor above the carb opening approximately the height of<br/>
      the air cleaner (stock).
     </p>
     <p>
      If you don&#x27;t have a velocity stack or tube like contrivance that hi,<br/>
      you will lose a lot of fuel. Serious mileage difference.
     </p>
     <p>
      The various stock cleaners seem to bear this out but I really couldn&#x27;t<br/>
      prove it.
     </p>
     <p>
      This is not to say a velocity stack over a decent air cleaner of the<br/>
      proper height, tho if I were racing, I think I would go with the stack.
