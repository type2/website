     The title says it. Mike Palima wanted to know what a "gas cut" was.
    </p>
    <p>
     This one has some amusement factor involved and maybe even some education value.
    </p>
    <p>
     While I was in the Navy, I was first a Boilerman and later a Machinist Mate and some other things we won't talk about.
    </p>
    <p>
     The gas leaks we had were large scale in comparison to the head of your car.
    </p>
    <p>
     High pressure steam at Superheated temperatures. That's what it's called.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the old ships the press/temp was 600 psi at 800 degree temp.
    </p>
    <p>
     Makes some almost efficient motivation. The steam has to travel maybe a 1/4 mile before it is used in the Turbines
    </p>
    <p>
     The newer ships use 1200 - 2000 psi and 1200 degree temps.
    </p>
    <p>
     That's almost up to the temps and pressures in your combustion chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
     You get a leak that starts with a drip, drip. If you can't get it fixed soon because of operating, you will soon have a groove cut across a 6 inch flange of solid steel 1/4" deep.
    </p>
    <p>
     All valve seats in the main steam system are "stellite" for this reason. It's about what the valve seats in some cars are made of.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the newer ships with 1200-2000 psi when they get a leak they just rope off half the fire-room where the leak is and don't go there.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rumour has it that 2/3 of the psycho cases in the Navy are boilermen or MM's.
    </p>
    <p>
     When you get one of these leaks you have to find it first.
    </p>
    <p>
     Providing it doesn't find you first.
    </p>
    <p>
     Without getting into the politics or remarks on "brain capacity", our "Hero" steppeth forth.
    </p>
    <p>
     He buttons up everything and screws down his white hat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Grasping his magic wand indicator, a broom stick, he goes to find the leak.
    </p>
    <p>
     Picture a 19 year old beardless youth dressed for the Artic in a 150 degree boiler-room.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sucking air thru his teeth cause he needs to breath and if he opens his mouth too far his heart will fall out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pucker factor is useless here, it's off the scale.
    </p>
    <p>
     And he's out here waving a broom handle over the general area like performing some religious ceremony with a scepter.
    </p>
    <p>
     All his crew-mates are back at the other end waiting and watching with bated breath.
    </p>
    <p>
     I never asked what they were waiting for 'cause I already know. Their next promotion.
    </p>
    <p>
     The first sumbitch who goes "psst" is going to eat this broom.
    </p>
    <p>
     I really have gone before the "mast" for this. If I catch him, I will do him great injury.
    </p>
    <p>
     When the steam cuts the broom handle in two you're real close.
    </p>
    <p>
     This is kind of "large scale" in comparison to your engine but the same laws apply.
    </p>
    <p>
     You have temps in the 2k range and pressures in the 1k range inside the combustion chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
     It doesn't take long for this to cut a puny little aluminum head.
    </p>
    <p>
     So torque those head bolts and be glad you're not waving a broom handle like "granpa had to do".
