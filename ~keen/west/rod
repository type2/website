       Hi Mike<br/>
       <br/>
       Im after a little advice from you but thought that it may benefit other<br/>
       members of the list as well.<br/>
       I have a shaft that I have to determine whether it  is straight or not. I<br/>
       have a DTI and stand and thats it...whats the cheapest way of finding out<br/>
       whether this thing is straight or not? I have heard that rollling it on a<br/>
       sheet of glass would help but what should I be looking for?<br/>
       <br/>
       Your advice is welcome and much appreciated.
      </p>

      Nick, you neglected to tell me what shaft or rod so now I have to<br/>
      do all of them and hope you aren&#x27;t talking about a shotgun.
     </p>
     <p>
      The lowly Pushrod is first:  Runout is .3mm (.012&quot;)<br/>
      If you&#x27;re using heavy valve springs, cut that number in half.
     </p>
     <p>
      This one is easy enough to see on a piece of flat glass or even a kitchen<br/>
      table. 12 thousandths is easy to see with the eye when you<br/>
      roll it.
     </p>
     <p>
      The cam shaft is next and now you need the dial indicator with stand<br/>
       a pair of &quot;V-blocks&quot; and a surface plate about 12&quot; square.
     </p>
     <p>
      Setting the v-blocks on #1 and #3 bearing surfaces, you measure the runout<br/>
      on the bearing in between.
     </p>
     <p>
      Should not exceed .02mm (.0008&quot;).
     </p>
     <p>
      On to the crankshaft:  set it up on the same bearings and measure out<br/>
      there in the middle on the #2 .
     </p>
     <p>
      A new crank should have 00.00 runout, per Bentley.
     </p>
     <p>
      A wear limit is set for this and should be not more than .03mm (.0012&quot;).
     </p>
     <p>
      Equipment as indicated above should run you $200 for plate and v-blocks.<br/>
      Not practical for one unit.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any decent machine shop should do this for you for the cost of a<br/>
      few minutes labor. Say 15 minutes.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bob Hoover is pretty sure this bent crank thing is the major cause<br/>
      of low miles on rebuilt engines. More so than Align-boring.
     </p>
     <p>
      I would have to agree, particularly if it isn&#x27;t even checked.
     </p>
     <p>
      Anyway, run it down to a competent shop and have them check it.<br/>
      It really is cheap insurance.
