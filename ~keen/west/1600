Subject: VW-1600 BUS LONG BLOCK REPLACEMENT STEPS

They may be of no use to most of you but the last couple of times I did a
long block swap for my '71 Bus, I decided that I would make notes about what
I did and when.  After you have done these things often enough you can do
it in your sleep but invariably you'll put a piece of shrouding on out of
order before some sort of gizmo that should have been bolted in place
first.  My notes were to prevent this sort of thing from happening and to
remind me of what tools I needed **before** I crawled underneath the Bus.
I was looking at them today and thought that they might be of some sort of
minimal utilty to those of you contemplating your spring rebuild or for
those that have never done it before.  You'll need Muir and the shop manual
anyway but it's nice to have a third opinion.

The notes below are sort of cryptic and may not be strictly applicable to
all 1600 Bus owners.  You should know that I belong to the "pull the
bumper + rear deck-use a sissor jack on the transmission-put a floor jack
on the engine-undo the bolts and nuts-and pull the engine rearward" school
of R&R; those of you who roll the Bus itself or jack it up may not find
this applicable.  I also have done a number of things to my Bus that
speed up R&R and my personal comfort such as having the gas line extend
into the engine compartment so that I need only disconnect it from the
pump, plug it up right then with a pencil, and push it through the
firewall (I used to do this under the Bus and always hated it when the gas
ran down my arm).  I also have a funky bumper attachement that probably
exists nowhere else in the world but other than this, it should be pretty
universal.

The stuff in squigly brackets {} refer to the tools needed.  The stuff in
square brackets [] refer to the parts or gaskets to be pulled off or
replaced.  The stuff in parentheses are only explanatory.  Other than the
initial washing of the engine with spray cleaner (what a nice thing that
is!), I don't mention any cleaning or painting of the tin, checking the
starter and polishing up the contacts, fixing the side lights while the
engine is out, etc, etc.  The idea here is to get the job done in the
minimal time and be focused on the matter at hand.

Hope you can use this.  I figured that with all the fine advice I've gotten
from the newsgroups I should give something back.

 legend:
 10mm skt           = regular 10mm socket with a socket wrench
 SP skt             = spark plug socket with a socket wrench
 long FSD           = big ol' flat head screwdriver
 short FSD          = short and stubby flat head screwdriver
 medium FSD         = you figure it out
 15mm deep skt      = deep 15mm  socket with a socket wrench
 short ext          = short socket extension
 long ext           = long socket extension
 8mm wrench         = 8mm box or open wrench
 cheater pipe       = piece of pipe to be used on handle of the socket wrench
 17mm ratchet wrench=sort of like a flat box wrench but has teeth, great
                     for the starter nut inside the engine compartment
                     (about $10 from Sears), a regular 17mm wrench will
                     also work
 stubby 13mm wrench =a small and short 13mm open end wrench
 monkey wrench      =what i call a cresent wrench
 flywheel lock      =from vw stores (about $10), keeps flywheel from moving,
                     not critical but saves wear on clutch bolt threads
                     since you can use the clutch bolts and a
                     piece of iron instead
 clutch alignment   =from vw stores (about $6), not critical since you can
                     do it by eye
