     They may be of no use to most of you but the last couple of times I did a long block swap for my '71 Bus, I decided that I would make notes about what I did and when. After you have done these things often enough you can do it in your sleep but invariably you'll put a piece of shrouding on out of order before some sort of gizmo that should have been bolted in place first. My notes were to prevent this sort of thing from happening and to remind me of what tools I needed **before** I crawled underneath the Bus. I was looking at them today and thought that they might be of some sort of minimal utilty to those of you contemplating your spring rebuild or for those that have never done it before. You'll need Muir and the shop manual anyway but it's nice to have a third opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
     The notes below are sort of cryptic and may not be strictly applicable to all 1600 Bus owners. You should know that I belong to the "pull the bumper + rear deck-use a sissor jack on the transmission-put a floor jack on the engine-undo the bolts and nuts-and pull the engine rearward" school of R&amp;R; those of you who roll the Bus itself or jack it up may not find this applicable. I also have done a number of things to my Bus that speed up R&amp;R and my personal comfort such as having the gas line extend into the engine compartment so that I need only disconnect it from the pump, plug it up right then with a pencil, and push it through the firewall (I used to do this under the Bus and always hated it when the gas ran down my arm). I also have a funky bumper attachement that probably exists nowhere else in the world but other than this, it should be pretty universal.
    </p>

     The stuff in squigly brackets {} refer to the tools needed. The stuff in square brackets [] refer to the parts or gaskets to be pulled off or replaced. The stuff in parentheses are only explanatory. Other than the initial washing of the engine with spray cleaner (what a nice thing that is!), I don't mention any cleaning or painting of the tin, checking the starter and polishing up the contacts, fixing the side lights while the engine is out, etc, etc. The idea here is to get the job done in the minimal time and be focused on the matter at hand.

     Hope you can use this. I figured that with all the fine advice I've gotten from the newsgroups I should give something back.

     legend:<br/>
     10mm skt           = regular 10mm socket with a socket wrench<br/>
     SP skt             = spark plug socket with a socket wrench<br/>
     long FSD           = big ol' flat head screwdriver<br/>
     short FSD          = short and stubby flat head screwdriver<br/>
     medium FSD         = you figure it out<br/>
     15mm deep skt      = deep 15mm  socket with a socket wrench<br/>
     short ext          = short socket extension<br/>
     long ext           = long socket extension<br/>
     8mm wrench         = 8mm box or open wrench<br/>
     cheater pipe       = piece of pipe to be used on handle of the socket wrench<br/>
     17mm ratchet wrench=sort of like a flat box wrench but has teeth, great for the starter nut inside the engine compartment (about $10 from Sears), a regular 17mm wrench will also work<br/>
     stubby 13mm wrench =a small and short 13mm open end wrench<br/>
     monkey wrench      =what i call a cresent wrench<br/>
     flywheel lock      =from vw stores (about $10), keeps flywheel from moving, not critical but saves wear on clutch bolt threads since you can use the clutch bolts and a piece of iron instead<br/>
     clutch alignment   =from vw stores (about $6), not critical since you can do it by eye
