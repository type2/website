    <p>
     The day after Christmas and you guys are still all stuffed with turkey or or playing with the nephews new RC car.
    </p>
    <p>
     We need a story here. . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     My brother in law has a new twist on this "help fellow motorists" thing.
    </p>
    <p>
     No matter who's driving what, he stops.
    </p>
    <p>
     His way is a little better than mine, he has a phone in the car.
    </p>
    <p>
     He's a gimp so it's kind of necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
     He isn't part of our little conspiracy against apathy but as he told me yesterday when he stopped for some little old lady, (pathetic ain't it?) :-) he figures one of these days he's going to be stuck some-place and he wants them all to remember it was a volkswagen helped them out that time.
    </p>
    <p>
     The lady just called her son to come get her and we're out of there. Beats poking around inside a Luv pickup. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     Later, we're talking about doing packed snow ice and how well he had done the week before over in Beatty. I guess that's how it's spelled, pronounced "Batey".
    </p>
    <p>
     Which of course brought to mind my trip up Greyback Mountain a few years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
     I was taking an Indian woman of whom I was aquainted up Greyback for the first snow of the season. About 4 foot up on top.
    </p>
    <p>
     I'm doing the bug scene at this time and have no fear.
    </p>
    <p>
     The no fear part is partly bravado in front of my friend,(women do that to guys) and partly because there is enough gear and rations to live for a week if need be, stuffed in the bonnet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Greyback is the mountain where the Oregon Caves are located.
    </p>
    <p>
     Miles and miles of under-ground caverns for the tourist trade.
    </p>
    <p>
     Discovered by a miner back in the "old days" who was out looking for his dog.
    </p>
    <p>
     He was looking for his dog because he'd sent the dog out some days before to look for the damned burro.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's kind of a three-cornered "love-hate" thing that is the plight of miners everywhere but since it is not germane to the story, we needn't pursue it.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was one of those "Winter Wonderland" days, the trees all hanging down with the weight of the snow, the road packed with about 4inches of this stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pocohantas is shooting pictures and I'm maintaining the the "Beetle crawl" up the mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
     We get almost to the caves and come to one of the spectacular scenes you see in Patagonia catalogs or a calender.
    </p>
    <p>
     Heavy Forest and heavy snow. So she wants to stop and shoot some.
    </p>
    <p>
     Outside curve going up the hill, so I stop.
    </p>
    <p>
     We get out to shoot the photos, slipping even in good boots, there on the road. I hear this sliding behind me and turn.
    </p>
    <p>
     There goes the Beetle right into the ditch. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     That's how little traction the little beast can drive in.
    </p>
    <p>
     The rest of the story is the embarrassing part.
    </p>
    <p>
     I have everything but chains. :-) Well. . . . . I never said I was perfect! :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     I'm being cool and shooting photos of Poco' digging it out of the snow-bank and along comes this guy from town who works at the 'Caves.
    </p>
    <p>
     He's from Florida. He just came from the tire store where he bought "chains"!
    </p>
    <p>
     He has never even had them out of the box yet, but he wants to try them out so he starts putting them on my car!
    </p>
    <p>
     Doesn't want me to help, he wants to figure it all out himself.
    </p>
    <p>
     I do some jacking etc. but that's about all. I'm really using up Karma that day.
    </p>
    <p>
     This guy from Florida was blue to the elbows by the time we got it out of the ditch.
    </p>
    <p>
     While this is going on, there are other "Intrepids" coming down the hill and we had a Jeep and a Bronco in the ditch up the hill, trying to miss me and the Floridans car.
    </p>
    <p>
     Get me out, these other guys are now putting their own chains on to get out of the ditch, I drive to the top, turn around and come back down.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now I insist he let me take them off mine and put on his.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No", he'd rather himself. He took them off mine now that I'm pointed down hill and put them on his own rig.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tho we stayed till he was done and I gave him a towel to dry with, I still feel like a jerk to this day. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     And no he wouldn't take money either.
    </p>
    <p>
     So back to the Karma thing, I have a big hole there.
    </p>
    <p>
     Figure I'm going to have to help some 18 wheeler chain up one of these days just to break even. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     The guy from Florida was driving something like a plymouth station wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
     He was a "split-window" dude anyway.
