       I've noticed a bit more drip on the cardboard lately and find drops of oil on the cap nuts in the morning.

       I remember someone mentioning in passing using Permatex on the sump plate when reassembling a type IV engine awhile back. Is it acceptable to substitute Permatex for the paper gaskets on the strainer and plate?
      </p>
      <p>
       Know also that the sump plate is probably not 100% flat—one plate stud is out of place after a broken stud repair, so the plate now has one larger hole to compensate.

      The non-flat plate and possible non-flat mounting surface is the problem.
     </p>
     <p>
      Get the plate flat, even if you have to buy another one.
     </p>
     <p>
      You can do this by pounding it flat on a hard flat surface and then lapping it with a flat surface and a sheet of emory paper.
     </p>
     <p>
      Clean the mounting surface area well and smooth it up as flat as possible also.
     </p>
     <p>
      Now with all surfaces as flat as possible and totally clean, put a light coat of Permatex aviation gasket gunk on the plate and mounting surface. Put a gasket equal to the unevenness of the surfaces on each side of the flange of the oil screen.
     </p>
     <p>
      Clean means completely oil free among other things.
     </p>
     <p>
      Now bolt it up and torque it evenly in a criss-cross pattern until all nuts are torqued evenly to spec.
     </p>
     <p>
      It should be ok after that. Luck favors the efficient. :-)
