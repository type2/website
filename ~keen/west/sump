  The non-flat plate and possible non-flat mounting surface is the problem.

 Get the plate flat, even if you have to buy another one.

 You can do this by pounding it flat on a hard flat surface and then
lapping it with a flat surface and a sheet of emory paper.

 Clean the mounting suface area well and smooth it up as flat as possible also.

 Now with all surfaces as flat as possible and totally clean, put a
light coat of permatex aviation gasket gunk on the plate and mounting
surface. Put a gasket equal to the unevenness of the surfaces on each
side of the flange of the oil screen.

Clean means completely oil free among other things.

 Now bolt it up and torque it evenly in a criss-cross pattern until
all nuts are torqued evenly to spec.

 It should be ok after that. Luck favors the efficient. :-)
