    <p>
     This one is the continuing saga of the untrained delving into the unknown with wild abandon.
    </p>
    <p>
     The rocker box is a can of worms of the first order.
    </p>
    <p>
     I've spoken on several occasions on tolerances. This little box is full of them and it's not all good.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tolerances is a word for allowance you give a machinist in making a part. It tends to be based on the type of equipment he has to work with.
    </p>
    <p>
     For instance, there is no use asking a machinist to make a part circular within .00002 if the lathe will only give you a repeatablilty of .0004. Actually that's a pretty good lathe.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then there is setup.
    </p>
    <p>
     Say you want the top of the spigot faces cut and parallel to the crank and inline with each other.
    </p>
    <p>
     The inline part can be pretty close because they will both be cut at the same time and the same setup.
    </p>
    <p>
     The parallel to the crank tho... how much time do you want to give this guy to set this up at $50 an hour?
    </p>
    <p>
     So he gets say a plus or minus .0010, ten thousandths, he can do that without too much trouble with a simple enough setup.
    </p>
    <p>
     So cost is the other factor here, actually the biggest factor.
    </p>
    <p>
     Getting back to the valves, you can see a half dozen machine operations that all affect the height and location of the valve stems and then about four more that affect where the rocker arm is going to come out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now we want to have these rockers built with untrained labor and all the parts be interchangeable.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even as flawed as I am about to declare them, they have run for over 50 years. I'm a low-down ingrate. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     Without further ado, lets look at one head, the right one and see what happens to the rockers as they push the valves up and down and spin them at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
     The rockers on the right head are all offset to the front of the car and this is what is supposed to give them the spin as they go up and down.
    </p>
    <p>
     #1 exhaust spins alright but to do so it moves along the rocker shaft against the spring loading and then bounces back.
    </p>
    <p>
     #1 intake having the same offset tries to do the same thing but is resting against the rocker assy post. Can't move along the shaft so all the offset just gets burnt up as friction into the various parts involved.
    </p>
    <p>
     The only turning the #1 intake can get is based on the clearance between the valve and the valve guide. Tiny.
    </p>
    <p>
     #2 intake has the spring on the same side as the offset so it can rotate ok as it goes up and down.
    </p>
    <p>
     #2 exhaust has the same condition as the #1 intake, ie., it rests against the post and has no spring loading on that side, so it can't do anything but burn the forces as friction.
    </p>
    <p>
     All of the above is based on the adjusting screw at least passing thru the center-line of the valve stem. If it doesn't then it won't turn at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     So what all the above says is that 2 of them work ok and 2 don't.
    </p>
    <p>
     It also says that even the best of them is side-loading the valve stems into the valve guides.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now if we take this head and move it around to the other side, it means the #3 exhaust is not a good spinner. It's the same one as the #2 exhaust.
    </p>
    <p>
     Many of, if not all of the aftermarket outfits remove those springs on the rocker shaft and replace with solid spacers.
    </p>
    <p>
     That puts the 2 good spinners into the same small spin state as the poor spinners.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another item that gets changed is the valve springs themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
     The greater the the spring load there, the greater the friction/galling you're going to have.
    </p>
    <p>
     The two items above are addressed to the hi-performance crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
     OK , we have excessive wear on the valve guides, rocker shafts,and the spacer springs on the rocker shaft.
    </p>
    <p>
     Also there is wear on the end of the valve stem and the adjusting screw itself.
    </p>
    <p>
     The items listed under "Also" are not excessive because the valve is catching hell down in the combustion chamber anyway and won't last long enough to call wear on the other end "excessive.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Bentley "Official Service Manual" says 25,000 miles on a head.
    </p>
    <p>
     Learn to live with it, if you get more you're golden.
    </p>
    <p>
     I'll post the "how to do a dinkum valve setup" in my next post.
    </p>
    <p>
     I will say this tho, as always, Bob Hoover is on the mark. The swivel foot adjusters is the way to help aleviate some of these galling/friction problems.
    </p>
    <p>
     The CB Performance setup with it's big foot probably isn't too bad either.
