   <article>
    <p>
     This is just filler to fill the void we have on the week-ends.
    </p>
    <p>
     Either these other people have full, adventurous lives or they are playing the list while at work. Vermin in any case. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     My latest find is a machine tool supply guy.
    </p>
    <p>
     He has just started a type1 super engine and is heavy into dune and brush buggies.
    </p>
    <p>
     He has gone from an open framed vehicle to a full vdubb body on his sand rail. I just gave him a body for his baja brush machine.
    </p>
    <p>
     It may have something to do with the weather.
    </p>
    <p>
     He had a fan shroud out back of the shop with all the duct blades and linkage on it. I asked if he was going to strip them out, as I need about 4 sets now.
    </p>
    <p>
     &quot;No, he said, since I got the baja I hardly drive the Suburban any more so I want to leave them in for those short cold morning trips&quot;.
    </p>
    <p>
     He'll end up driving a stock restored Oval at the rate he's going. Wearing a tie and stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
     He has every catalog known to man. All those $5-10 jobs.
    </p>
    <p>
     CB Performance has a nice one.
    </p>
    <p>
     He's polishing and porting a set of CB Perf's heads for the &quot;super fly&quot;. Little shop in the back, including a lathe and mill.
    </p>
    <p>
     &quot; He's never had a friend like me&quot;.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hydraulic case and 86mm crank. Berg of course.
    </p>
    <p>
     I think he's using 92mm c/p's but I didn't commit to LT memory.
    </p>
    <p>
     He didn't get the case full flowed so he's going to use one of those combo rigs, pump/filter.
    </p>
    <p>
     He tells of blowing up one engine due to machine chips in the front oil relief valve.
    </p>
    <p>
     He tells of putting wider brake shoes and bigger brake cylinders in the stock drums.
    </p>
    <p>
     His sand rail has no front brakes and disk rear brakes. Bucks.
    </p>
    <p>
     This bug I gave him in a sense is a &quot;no title&quot; job. It's clean and not really impossible to get title. Just very difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
     He's going to take the front end and tranny out for me and he keeps the rest. It's a '70 std. Has pop-out rear windows. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     My brother had taken a torch to the rear clip so he could remove the engine easier.
    </p>
    <p>
     He's a monster. Has an acetyline rig.
    </p>
    <p>
     This car also has 5 lug drums on the back from somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
     Don't feel sorry for the car, it several steps up from the dumb farm boys who my brother got it from.
    </p>
    <p>
     They had put baja fenders on, big tires but that's all. Then they ran the poor thing till the bearings, as in all, were so bad it ruined the case. I have never seen the like. It had over-heated and frozen up dozens of times from it's appearance. They must have push started it with the tractor.
    </p>
    <p>
     Getting back to the New Friend, he also tells me that the stock bug transmission is fine for under 2 liters. When he put a 2085 in, it blew up. We're talking sand rail here and they take a hard beating.
    </p>
    <p>
     He also hates &quot;Transform&quot;, for those who recognize the name.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a bad gear in a tranny but he ran it for a year and a half anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
     What he runs now is a bus tranny beefed up locally and close ratio third and fourth.
    </p>
    <p>
     He has also destroyed a &quot;super differential&quot;. The impression I got was it was a cheaper, welded, increased spacer... etc. Another case of you get what you pay for.
    </p>
    <p>
     He now uses a custom machined expensive, I didn't record the name, differential set-up and has never had a problem.
    </p>
    <p>
     I imagine he has also learned not to go over cliffs at that angle anymore too.
    </p>
    <p>
     &quot;Education is painful&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
     Now all I have to do is figure out all the ways to exploit this relation-ship. Quid Pro Quo, of course.
