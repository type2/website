     The accuracy of gauges.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the brothers recently pointed out some fairly cheap ways to get a gauge in the system.
    </p>
    <p>
     Kudos to Mike Jones for bringing it up.
    </p>
    <p>
     I want to cover another aspect of gauges tho, that has nothing to do with their price etc.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the world at large, it is considered foolish to put a remote gauge in a system without a direct reading gauge right at the unit being measured to check it against.
    </p>
    <p>
     This is where your life or the life of some expensive machinery is at risk.
    </p>
    <p>
     So right along side that remote sending unit will be a big direct reading mercury thermometer. Or a Bourdon tube press. gauge.
    </p>
    <p>
     VW engines don't really fall in that category unless you're poor like me. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     The gauges we use, ie. elect. sender to elect. gauge are remote gauges. It isn't too practical to put in a direct gauge as vibration will eat the thing.
    </p>
    <p>
     The temp sender is alright as far as construction is concerned but the pressure sensor is a type called "Aneroid", a diaphragm chingadero. I was warned about those in grade school.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ok, we use them and rely on them, I suppose.
    </p>
    <p>
     Let's see what we can do here.
    </p>
    <p>
     One more item of interest: all gauges read the most accurate at the 60% range. Which means if you want to read a 60 psi circuit you put in a 100 psi gauge and sender.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now we look at calibration.
    </p>
    <p>
     Temperature gauges are easy, we have two standards in our lives called "frozen" and "boiling".
    </p>
    <p>
     Stick the sensor in ice water, (with cubes) to check the acurracy of that end and in boiling (just rolling) water to check the other.
    </p>
    <p>
     We're not so lucky when it comes to standards to check a pressure sensor and gauge.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the industry, there are 2 ways. One is against a master gauge. One that has been calibrated and is certified.
    </p>
    <p>
     The second method is on a "dead-weight" tester, which is how the master gauge got calibrated.
    </p>
    <p>
     A dead-weight tester is a one inch piston with fluid under it, and weights are stacked on it pushing the fluid into the gauge you're testing.
    </p>
    <p>
     I wish I could pull a rabbit out of the hat and tell you how to whip one up out of cardboard but there is no chance.
    </p>
    <p>
     Your best shot here would be to buy a very good bourdon tube gauge for a "master" and take it to a lab and have it calibrated.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then you could test your sensors and other gauges against it.
    </p>
    <p>
     I suppose I should mention that your gauges are reliant on a voltage source. Some more than others.
    </p>
    <p>
     You have low voltage, I would expect your gauge to read low.
    </p>
    <p>
     Since they work in the millivolt range I doubt that's a big issue.
    </p>
    <p>
     Location of senders has already been covered by various members, no point in belaboring that again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Recomendations? Don't count on your gauges too much.
    </p>
    <p>
     Periodically check them against a standard.
    </p>
    <p>
     Put in a fitting where you can take a direct reading to check them one against the other.
    </p>
    <p>
     that's all, west :-)
