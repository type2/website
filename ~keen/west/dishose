Subject: Distributor Vacuum Hoses - Where do they go?

Steve White brought up an excellent question that puzzles some from time
to time.  Over the years, many a 71-74 Beetle and 71 Bus with Dual
Diaphragm Distributors have graced my doors and about half the time the
vacuum lines are backwards.  So here's the poop:

First, take a look at your Vacuum can.  On the flat side of the can is a
hose fitting - for the larger (4.5mm GREEN) hose.  This is the RETARD
side.

Second, on the cone (or rounded) side of the can is the smaller hose
fitting.  This uses a 3.5mm hose, usually black.  This is the ADVANCE
side.

Third, look at your 34PICT Carburetor.  The fitting on the LEFT side of
the carb is for the ADVANCE side of your Vaccum can.  Connect
appropriately.

Fourth, look at your 34PICT Carb again.  On the rear (RIR) of the carb
should be a fitting up towards, but not on the carburetor top.  This
push-on fitting is just slightly larger than then one on the side.  This
is for your RETARD side of your Vacuum can.  Connect appropriately with
the 4.5mm Green Hose.

Fifth, Any other fittings on your 34PICT Carb are for the infamous
Throttle Positioner sometimes improperly called a "Decel Valve".  The
fitting for this jewel is an angled one right at the rear base of the
carburetor.  Connect the small vacuum hose to it to the Throttle
Positioner Diaphragm Fitting.  If your Throttle Positioner has two
fittings (as original on 71 Buses, 71-74 Beetles), connect another length
of 3.5mm vacuum hose from that to the Throttle Positioner Solenoid,
usually located in the left side of the engine compartment.  If you don't
have the Throttle Positioner, cap off all the remaining fittings on your
carburetor.

If you're running one of those new replacement H30/31PICT carbs, the
procedure above is the same as they come with these fittings like their
distant 34PICT cousins.  Original 30PICT Series did not have the RETARD
fitting, except for Beetle Auto-Suck Models - BUT - this fitting was for
the Auto-Suck Solenoid, not the distributor because they were still
single vacuum models (Actually, the Auto-Suck use a combined
vacuum/mechanical distributor similar to the 76-78 Buses).  Buses don't
have these, right?  So use this fitting for your RETARD side of the Dual
Diaphragm Can.

Timing is usually 5 degrees AFTER Top Dead Center when using a Dual
Diaphragm Distributor, give or take a degree or two - no two engine
setups or running conditions are the same, so you''' have to fool with
with of course.  One other thing - Strobe Light at idle speed with the
hoses CONNECTED.  Sorry, no static timing with these, except to initially
set the distributor at 0 TDC, start the engine, then strobiscopically
time it after it warms up.

I am working on the definitive distributor number application guide for
my company website right now for customers to order points, condensors,
etc.  It will show the Volkswagen as well as the Bosch stamping numbers
to properly ID that jewel you may find at the local recycler's yard,
information gathered from my collection of Ancient Bosch Books, VW Parts
Books and the latest microfilms to also show what is superseded to what
and even some "can uses".  Should be up by this coming weekend if I
continue to burn the midnight oil.
