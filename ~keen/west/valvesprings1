    <pre>All valve springs suffer from harmonics, as the spring is compressed the<br/>
metallurgy wants to push back, this causes the spring to be a spring.  Each<br/>
spring for a given size load and compression and rate of compression will<br/>
have a certain harmonic vibration associated with it.  Typically, the larger<br/>
the spring wire, the stronger the spring the higher rate of compression and<br/>
more compression it will take before excessive harmonics come into play. <br/>
<br/>
When excessive harmonics come into play, the spring starts oscillating this<br/>
oscillation results in a reduced amount of pressure the spring exerts.  My<br/>
boss used to work on software that was for ship engines, ya know massive<br/>
springs with literally hundreds of pounds of valve spring pressure.  The<br/>
cams for these ship engines had to be designed very carefully, otherwise <br/>
the harmonics involved for the spring would cause them to break.  The<br/>
same thing holds true for a car engine, for a given spring load, lift<br/>
and rate of compression (cam ramp and RPM) will cause the harmonics and<br/>
oscillation to come into play.  When this happens, the valve doesn't fully<br/>
get the seating pressure it needs since one force is expanding the spring<br/>
and the oscillation is causing the spring to want to vibrate.  This causes<br/>
the valve to float or stay partially open.  This happens with cams with<br/>
fast ramps or high RPM.<br/>
<br/>
Stronger springs resist the oscillation factor and allow you to run<br/>
more RPMs and or a faster ramped cam.  The Ramp is the rate at which<br/>
the valve goes from closed to open to closed and obviously has a direct<br/>
effect on the valve spring.<br/>
<br/>
Why is this important in a bus?  Heat.  Heat reduces the effectiveness of<br/>
the spring in such a way that the oscillation or floating factor happens<br/>
and a lower RPM or with a comparably slower ramped cam that would be used<br/>
in a bug.  A bus does run hotter than a bug, no question about it.  The<br/>
engine has to produce more power for a given speed, weight and air and<br/>
everything else comes into play.  <br/>
<br/>
St. Berg has numerous articles about it, but all high RPM racers and<br/>
every street bus I build now has at least high rev singles and in <br/>
some cases duals.  The 2110 I have in my 64 has dual high rev springs, the<br/>
single high revs I originally installed wouldn't allow me to get up over<br/>
5500RPM easily, now I can rev to my hearts content.<br/>
<br/>
Valve float causes a lot of problems from broken valves and keepers to<br/>
busted retainers and springs.  This also contributes to early seat failure<br/>
as well.  The trick is balancing the needs of the engine and it's design<br/>
with the amount of spring required.  If you never will see over 5000RPM<br/>
use single high rev springs.  I say this because the stock springs in the<br/>
busses have suffered from float at as low as 2500RPM.  That's slower than<br/>
freeway speed for most of them.<br/>
<br/>
Naysayers will tell you "heavier springs require more horsepower", which<br/>
has some truth to it, but it is mostly bunk.  When you eliminiate float,<br/>
you provide better combustion, better valve life and your engine will work<br/>
better and produce more power.<br/>
<br/>
Another naysaying is "Heavier springs cause the valves to break" again bunk.<br/>
Think about it, your forcing the valve to follow the cam precisely, the<br/>
cam is what closes the valve and it doesn't let the valve slam onto the <br/>
seat!  This promotes better wear on the cam and lifter surfaces as well<br/>
since the lifter isn't flying away from the cam, they're maintaining<br/>
good contact.  As always, adjust your valves regularly.<br/>
<br/>
You also can use singles or duals with stock aluminum timing<br/>
gears.  Using straight cut gears does reduce horsepower demands and cam<br/>
thrust bearing wear, but proper clearance checking of the thrust bearing<br/>
will allow full life of the cam bearings using stock gears.  Triple Springs<br/>
are available from GBE, but do require straightcut gears.<br/>
<br/>
So, if you have a bus or use a non stock cam or want to run at higher RPM,<br/>
you should change your springs.  Single High Rev springs are about $35 bucks<br/>
and can be installed in under 1/2 hour.  You can rent the tool from a local<br/>
rental place and DIY.  High Rev duals require machining of the bosses<br/>
in the heads and isn't for the average DIY.<br/>
