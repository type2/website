      This all makes sense, but I have one question.
     </p>
     <p>
      When shimming the rocker shafts this high, should the pushrod length be adjusted according? I see a large change in the aspect of the valve train when shimming like this.
     </p>
     <p>
      Thanks

     Bill, yes, I expect it's going to increase the length to the push-rods. In my case, I'm building a new engine so they have to be sized anyway.

     If you're using an existing setup then it's hard to say what you may have to do to salvage your push-rods. Or if you even want to.
    </p>
    <p>
     You have more than one reason to change push-rods, what about the spacers under the jugs etc.? Cam lobes, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
     Assuming a .125" difference, that could be made up by running the adjusters out that much farther times the 1.1 ratio. There should be that much adjustment left in the screw.
    </p>
    <p>
     Only then you have changed the position of the center of the adjuster to some new point with what outcome, I have no idea.
    </p>
    <p>
     I suspect it would move the adjuster point slightly higher, as in thousandths of an inch.
