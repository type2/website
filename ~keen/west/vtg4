  Bill, yes, I expect it's going to increase the length to the push-rods. In
my case, I'm building a new engine so they have to be
sized anyway.

If you're using an existing setup then it's hard to say what you may
have to do to salvage your push-rods. Or if you even want to.

You have more than one reason to change push-rods, what about the
spacers under the jugs etc.? Cam lobes, etc.

 Assuming a .125" difference, that could be made up by running the
adjusters out that much farther times the 1.1 ratio.
There should be that much adjustment left in the screw.

 Only then you have changed the position of the center of the adjuster
to some new point with what outcome, I have no idea.

I suspect it would move the adjuster point slightly higher, as
in thousandths of an inch.
