    <p>
       Just some random news from the Far Northwest (but not too far).
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time past, I posted about Baja Buddy and his locally grown<br/>
     hydraulic lifter setup.  Oil passages all machined out and Ford lifters<br/>
     fitted. An Engle hydraulic cam.
    </p>
    <p>
      He finally has that together and is doing the final shake-down thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Has a set of Kadrons on it. 1776 cc. Jetting and stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had it all ready to go, took it out for a quick trip, blew the fan<br/>
     up. (type1 fan shroud)
    </p>
    <p>
      Pieces flew off the fan hard enough to do physical damage to the case and<br/>
     jugs. Not too serious but impressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Totally wiped out a doghouse shroud with flaps in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He mumbles about "damn brazilian parts". He doesn't actually know but<br/>
     the replacement is pure german.
    </p>
    <p>
      Talking to my Flaps, he says they tried a cogged timing belt with<br/>
     appropriate pulleys once and that was all it did. Destroy fans.
    </p>
    <p>
      The belt needs to slip when you have those hi-revving machines.  :=)
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick of the above, had a new engine and a fresh power fan belt, which<br/>
     he no doubt had as tight as he could get it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll get all the dope and do a report when he gets it smoothed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the personal front, I just lost a fender. The dumb kid story.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had just cherried out all four fenders last summer and was plotting<br/>
     on the paint.  I was less than cordial about the damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      He suggested I was making him feel bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never underestimate the size field it takes for a 17 year old to turn<br/>
     the family pickup around in.  As you can see, I still have much to<br/>
     learn.    :-)
    </p>
    <p>
      "MY FLAPS LEARNS THE HARD WAY"
    </p>
    <p>
       My flaps decided to start building engines at home.<br/>
     Why split the profit with them other pukes?
    </p>
    <p>
      So now he's mumbling about "goddamn parts" of all nationalities and<br/>
     mainly remanufactured.
    </p>
    <p>
      His latest was with a bent crank.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is from his "Own Handpicked Crank-grinder".
    </p>
    <p>
      Mumbling about "cheap but they don't checkem, I thought they checkedem".<br/>
     :-) (total glee from listener)
    </p>
    <p>
      Been telling him about that stuff for over a year. (gloating chuckle<br/>
     here)
    </p>
    <p>
      That does not mean he will be more concientious about his parts and<br/>
     single handedly improve the quality of life as we now know it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It most likely means he will drag all those parts he took home, back<br/>
     to the store and not build any more engines.  :-)
    </p>
    <p>
      Back to the Bajas,<br/>
     Dick has an unusual Crankcase ventilation hook-up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "dual 58's" he has hanging off that machine for carbs don't leave<br/>
     him much hope for vacuum off the intake header.
    </p>
    <p>
      This thing has an air-cleaner bigger then the gas tank and is a dune<br/>
     buggy. Twentyfiveninetyeight cee cee's or some big number.
    </p>
    <p>
      Got guages worth more than my whole car.  :-(
    </p>
    <p>
      He pulls a vacuum for the crankcase from the merged header "merge<br/>
     point". Where you would put the O2 sensor, if you had one.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's a pitot tube into the center of the exhaust, then a check valve,<br/>
     then the flex hose to the fill tube on the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the old timers told him he'd need that to keep "blow-by"<br/>
     to a minimum. Seems to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm scheming on shortening some push-rod tubes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ones I need are about 1/4" longer than the old ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new ones only come a full inch longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      " Forty-two dollars?!"  . . . V-dub ! . . . Not the Porsche Stuff!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The push-rods and swivel feet are a substantial chunk of change if<br/>
     you're building a beater.
    </p>
    <p>
      I should have stuck with the chrome tin.   :-)
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I have to build some kind of machine to shorten the damn tubes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mumble . .   Mumble  . . . . .
