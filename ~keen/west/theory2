     Gentleman, and ladies...
    </p>
    <p>
     I'm going to hold off answering your questions until I get this whole package set up.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yes to all who said there should be a slight offset from the one center that I said it should be on center.
    </p>
    <p>
     The question in my mind still is how much is slight.
    </p>
    <p>
     I need to put the things thru their paces in the other direction to get a good answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Right now I'm looking at little circles on paper with lines of travel running thru them and mumbling a lot.
    </p>
    <p>
     Visions of my valves not only going up and down but rotating at 2000 rpm is a bit hard on my head.
    </p>
    <p>
     I'll get back to you.
