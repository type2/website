 Gentleman, and ladies. . . . . .

 I'm going to hold off answering your questions until I get this whole
package set up.

 Yes to all who said there should be a slight offset from the one center
that I said it sholud be on center.

 The question in my mind still is how much is slight.

 I need to put the things thru their paces in the other direction to
get a good answer.

 Right now I'm looking at little circles on paper with lines of travel
running thru them and mumbling a lot.

 Visions of my valves not only going up and down but rotating at 2000
rpm is a bit hard on my head.

 I'll get back to you.
