Emissions specs vary given climate and engine temp.  A hotter engine will
actually produce less emissions that one that's cold.  I'll qualify that so
I don't get jumped on the list.  Most of the smog controls that are on an
engine surround cold starting emissions (whether they be "physical" or
"logical" as in later vehicles is immaterial).  When an engine is cold, it
requires more fuel to keep running (remember chokes?).  Anyway the EPA and
the Auto makers figured this out.  It could be that the shop in question
tested the engine cold, which will normally indicate higher HC readings or
the latter of your statement applies.  The equipment is bad or the techs
aren't up to snuff.

Also remember this.  I live in a state that has annual smog (as well as
safety inspections) and I've had variances from shop to shop.  I've now
found a highly reliable, reputable shop to get my work done (that which I
can't do myself).  I worked on my neighbors 84 Bronco (Big one) and dialed
in the engine after a tune up.  My CO meter read 1.5% at the pipe (spec was
2.0).  They took it into the shop and it wouldn't pass.  I checked it
again, again 1.5%, they took it back.  Again it wouldn't pass.  Finally I
sent them to my shop where I get my tests done.  The tech immediately
spotted the problem.  The Techs at the first shop were using the wrong
engine and tailpipe configuration for the test equipment.  Instead of a 302
they were testing for a 351 with dual pipes.  Moral  Techs are people too. 
After dialing in for a 302, single exhaust guess what, 1.2% CO (I guess my
meter needs calibration).

Ask around for people with VWs and ask where they get work done.  In this
day and age there are just too many damn fly by night operations to contend
with.  Boy the stories I could tell ya...
