     The rear wheel camber is definitely adjustable on IRS cars. First, you have to loosen (not remove) the three bolts that hold the trailing arm to the spring plate. If you are behind the rear tire looking at the trailing arm, you will see that it is hollow and there is room to stick a pry bar or BIG screwdriver in there for leverage. If the rear wheels are too far in at the top, rotate the trailing arm up, and it will push the top of the wheel out. Conversely, rotating the trailing arm down will pull the top of the wheel in. This is possible because you are able to rotate the trailing arm about an axis that runs from its pivot point (up by the torsion housing) to the three bolts that hold it to the spring plate. Try it if you don't believe me, I promise it works. This is how it was designed to be adjustable for camber.

     If you have an IRS car that is really slammed in the back, you will have to enlarge the holes in the springplates to get the trailing arm rotated up far enough to get back to zero camber.
