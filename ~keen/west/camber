Subject: Re: Rear wheels camber

The rear wheel camber is definitely adjustable on IRS cars.  First, you have
to loosen (not remove) the three bolts that hold the trailing arm to the spring
plate.  If you are behind the rear tire looking at the trailing arm, you will
see that it is hollow and there is room to stick a pry bar or BIG screwdriver
in there for leverage.  If the rear wheels are too far in at the top, rotate
the trailing arm up, and it will push the top of the wheel out.  Conversely,
rotating the trailing arm down will pull the top of the wheel in.  This is
possible because you are able to rotate the trailing arm about an axis that
runs from its pivot point (up by the torsion housing) to the three bolts that
hold it to the spring plate.  Try it if you don't believe me, I promise it
works.  This is how it was designed to be adjustable for camber.

If you have an IRS car that is really slammed in the back, you will have to
enlarge the holes in the springplates to get the trailing arm rotated up far
enough to get back to zero camber.
