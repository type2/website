   <article>
    <p>
     We covered finding the long and the short pistons and rods in the "Balancing" articles. All being in the name of a "balanced" Compression Ratio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here's some more on the subject: "The long and short jugs".
    </p>
    <p>
     Having finally recieved an hours clear sky, I painted my jugs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ala Hoover, tho I used paint thinner in lieu of gasoline.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then they sat on the oil heater for a week drying.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's cold and damp here so pay no mind to drying time.
    </p>
    <p>
     In sitting here looking at them, it occurred to me that they represent another stack of tolerances in the continued quest for the perfectly balanced CR.
    </p>
    <p>
     In fact, there is another stack out in the shop on the case where the jugs sit.
    </p>
    <p>
     The distance the spigot is from the center of the crank.
    </p>
    <p>
     The guy had to have some tolerance to work from, + - .005", .001, who knows?
    </p>
    <p>
     So there is a long and short spigot face also.
    </p>
    <p>
     Getting back to the jugs, I "miked" them.
    </p>
    <p>
     There's a + - .005 on them too. One as low as 4.430" and one up to 4.440".
    </p>
    <p>
     The other two are in beetween.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's not much again but it can help with the stack-up of the pistons and rods.
    </p>
    <p>
     It also might be worth-while to put the closest matches together since any difference will be a tweak in the heads when they're bolted on.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the spigot faces, I'd hate to start messing with that, tho it could be done. A little grinding could change them some.
    </p>
    <p>
     The caveat there tho, is what if you stick another set of jugs in later and the numbers run the other way?
    </p>
    <p>
     Looking at these volumetric balances:
    </p>
    <p>
     Assume a .005" difference on a stock jug of 85.5mm diameter.
    </p>
    <p>
     Running thru the numbers, that equates to .7 CC.
    </p>
    <p>
     That isn't too bad for the balance we're looking for but when it does the same thru four parts and gets into the .020" (.5mm) then you're looking at a couple, three, CC's. Plus the + - .5 CC you left in the combustion chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
     Any of it is livable but if you don't have to have it, why do so?
    </p>
    <p>
     Where do you draw the line on this stuff?
    </p>
    <p>
     Assume you have a car entered in the Baja 1000.
    </p>
    <p>
     How far will you go to get reliability and performance?
    </p>
    <p>
     The car won't see a repair shop for a thousand miles, or is it kilometers?
    </p>
    <p>
     Now assume you're "Jane Average" with 2 kids and just drive back and forth 30 miles to work every day.
    </p>
    <p>
     The car needs tires but Billy needs a doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
     That Baja racer will see complete refurbishment long before Janes "daily driver" will see an oil change. So who's the long distance runner?
    </p>
    <p>
     What about mileage? Does the racer with a sponsor need better gas mileage than Jane? She doesn't have a sponsor. "less you count food stamps.
    </p>
    <p>
     Every dollar spent for gas is money the kids can't eat.
    </p>
    <p>
     You get my drift here.
    </p>
    <p>
     So let's look at important from the point that it has to be running again no later than Tuesday.
    </p>
    <p>
     Balance the weights of the components and get the CG's of the rods the same. Take a look at the combustion chamber and keep it under 1 CC difference.
    </p>
    <p>
     After that it's all relatively minor improvements and tho the "beater" should have the best, the world doesn't work that way.
    </p>
    <p>
     In fact you really want to save some gas, re-build that howling transmission. That noise is horsepower leaks.
