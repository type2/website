 It's a mechanical term used to bilk young boys and old ladies out
of their cash.

 When you shut the engine down it's still hot and that heat just soaks in to
every thing. It gets to the fuel line and vaporizes it.
 You have in essence nothing but air in the line.

 Generally this just takes a few more cranks with the starter to pull
fuel back up in the pump/carb.

 There is a filter in the gas tank that needs replacing every twenty
years or so. May restrict the line enough to give you fits with the
"vapor lock" thing.

 This in no way implies you need a new tank.

 You probably need to pull the tank and replace the little $10 filter
screen.

 Get a new mechanic for gods sake!
