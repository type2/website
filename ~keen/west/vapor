      Hi all. Just talked to my mechanic (because I had to resort to a mechanic) who says my problem may be the dreaded vapor lock.
     </p>
     <p>
      Now, I've heard the term before, but now that it's maybe hit so close to home, I realize I don't really understand what it is!
     </p>
     <p>
      Can somebody please explain it to me? He says I may need a new gas tank. Blah.

     It's a mechanical term used to bilk young boys and old ladies out of their cash.

     When you shut the engine down it's still hot and that heat just soaks in to every thing. It gets to the fuel line and vaporizes it. You have in essence nothing but air in the line.
    </p>
    <p>
     Generally this just takes a few more cranks with the starter to pull fuel back up in the pump/carb.
    </p>

     There is a filter in the gas tank that needs replacing every twenty years or so. May restrict the line enough to give you fits with the vapor lock thing.
    </p>
    <p>
     This in no way implies you need a new tank.
    </p>
    <p>
     You probably need to pull the tank and replace the little $10 filter screen.
