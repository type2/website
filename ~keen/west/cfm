     I went to the net and searched for drill sizes for the carb jets.
    </p>
    <p>
     And there they were! At least a few.
    </p>
    <p>
     The drills I speak of are wire gauge drills, in numbers from 1 to 80.
    </p>
    <p>
     In drill sizes the larger the number the smaller the drill.
    </p>
    <p>
     It turns out that the carby jet size is in hundredths of a millimeter.
    </p>
    <p>
     Example: a 132 jet is 1.32mm diameter and is a #55 drill.
    </p>
    <p>
     This holds true for air jets too. A #78 drill is a 41 air jet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Any drill chart will give you the others if it has the metric equivalence.
    </p>
    <p>
     Looking at the sizes available, each drill size is approx. 10% larger than the one before it and 12% greater cross-section.
    </p>
    <p>
     A plan used by my machine supply guy and avid dune crawler, he buys two of every jet he is going to open up.
    </p>
    <p>
     He says you can't find the max till you go over it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then he whips out the fresh one and drills it back to the last size.
    </p>
    <p>
     If he has dual carbs he has four on hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     On a single carb, I expect you could solder the end closed and then re-drill, but on duals, I doubt you could ever balance the flow with a random sized solder blob.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whichever method you use, be sure and chamfer the jet end after drilling. Just a slight one to break any burr there.
    </p>

     The Cubic Feet per Minute of our Carbys:
    </p>
    <p>
     I worked up a formula based on the Liters and rpm so you guys can figure what you have with bigger engines and so forth.
    </p>
    <p>
     The formula is (Liters X rpm)/ 56.64
    </p>
    <p>
     Using a 1600, it's (1.6L X 4500rpm)divided by the 56.64 equals 127 CFM.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you're running two carbs then each carb will draw half that.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now you can steal parts off Chevys or whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
     Keep in mind that there has to be some restriction at the carb or you can't boil gas. Vacuum, remember? :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     That formula is just based on stroke and bore so if you have too small of valves or restricted exhaust you won't achieve the full potential.
    </p>
    <p>
     So go forth Monster Makers and create new legends!
    </p>
    <p>
     Proving there is more to a VW than too small a backseat. :-)
