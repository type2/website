    <p>
     I was out surfing on the net, looking for some data on carb jet sizes and found myself reading some trouble shooting guides on small engines.
    </p>
    <p>
     As in water sports and the like. 8500 rpm, I think.
    </p>
    <p>
     The thing about such engines, is they suffer the same problems as we do only because of their size or rpm, it's more acute.
    </p>
    <p>
     This one in particular was on air leaks.
    </p>
    <p>
     An air leak to them means lean burning and possible piston seize at hi rpm. Runs and acts fine at low rpm.
    </p>
    <p>
     So they have to do pressure tests on the whole case. 6-9 psi.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alright we don't have such an acute symptom. Then again, we have problems the V8 boys don't.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's all kind of relative to your size.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still, let's look a little deeper into some of our own type problems.
    </p>
    <p>
     We know that any leak of air can affect the air fuel mixture.
    </p>
    <p>
     Found that out in the smog test stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not just the intake and exhaust manifold.
    </p>
    <p>
     That means the leaking valve or stem, or rings, or even a push-rod tube leak, can mean an air leak to the fuel mix.
    </p>
    <p>
     There's also the loose heads that haven't been properly torqued.
    </p>
    <p>
     Where I'm going with this is that a guy buys a '69 and it backfires a lot. Oil dripping from every pore.
    </p>
    <p>
     He seals the intake and exhaust and sets the timing and fiddles with the carb and it still does it. He's dissed.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are at least a dozen things that can cause the engine to back fire and he's maybe fixed two.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is no help for this guy till he completely goes thru the engine and makes it all right.
    </p>
    <p>
     Those same problems will make an engine overheat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Richening the carb will not help.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thickening the oil might for a time but that engine is on it's way out. Poor thing, mean ol' owner.
