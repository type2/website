    <pre>&gt;Hi all, I posted last night after a frustrating evening that started when I<br/>
&gt;went to adjust the valves on my new engine (40hp, 83mm, single port). I can<br/>
see how the push rod oil lubes the rockers, but what abt the<br/>
&gt;stem/guides?  I think Muir mentions assembling rocker mounting blocks with<br/>
&gt;thte bevel out and the slot up...but my blocks have no bevel or slot!  Is<br/>
&gt;this slot he speaks of relate dto lubrication of the valves?  Did someone<br/>
&gt;put the wrong ones on my engine?  And what book/net resource has a good<br/>
&gt;description of proper rocker geometry assembly?   Somebody, please HELP, I<br/>
&gt;want to drive this for more than a few days without pulling the engine<br/>
&gt;again!    TIA!  -Gerry<br/>

 Well,  . . . .   I have a couple posts on VTG and Rocker Arms up at<br/>
<br/>
 http://www.armory.com/~y21cvb/west/darkness.html.<br/>
<br/>
 David Raistrick has them on his web page.<br/>
<br/>
 The rocker mouunting blocks do normally have 2 big chamfers on the<br/>
 top and bottom edges that face out. If yours don't, it's not a big  deal.<br/>
Also, said mounting blocks are split on the top side, exposing  the main<br/>
shaft that holds the rocker arms. The main shaft doesnt turn<br/>
 thru those bushings so the split can only be to get lurication to the<br/>
 ends of the rocker arm bushings.<br/>
<br/>
 At best I wouldn't say it was all that necessary but I wasn't there<br/>
 when they decided to do it so  . . . . . who knows?<br/>
<br/>
 From Muirs point of view, if you dont' have the bevels (chamfers)<br/>
 down on the head itself and the slots turned down relative to the<br/>
 engine you're in fat city.<br/>
<br/>
 I don't have a head here in the house with me but I do have my   favorite<br/>
Rocker arms here. . . the hole in the mounting block is not<br/>
 evenly spaced from each end (symetrical) and the long side goes down.<br/>
<br/>
 There is no lubrication for the valve stems/valve guides per se,<br/>
 just catch as catch can and there is even supposed to be a seal on<br/>
 the valve stem to keep oil out. Can't have oil  running down the stem<br/>
 into the combustion side.<br/>
<br/>
 Bottom line: these rocker arms and guides are far from perfect in<br/>
functioning forever. Bentley recommends 25k miles as life of heads<br/>
 for that reason. Replace standard adjusters with "swivel foots" for<br/>
 max life of vave guides.<br/>
 The valves still need replacing and seats relapped at 25 k or so.<br/>
