     Points and Gapping or "Dwell".
    </p>
    <p>
     Thanks to Michael Butler for pointing out I'd glossed over this function a bit too fast in "Coils n' points"
    </p>
    <p>
     The points control the field of the secondary winding in the coil and this could go on indefinitely within reason. Like burning up the points.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here's the part I didn't mention, it's when the points open, that the coil gets desperate for a way out. There's no ground thru the points to bleed to.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the micro or millisecond after the points open is when the coil fires the spark plug.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, the length of time the points are closed is the length of time the field has to build it's charge.
    </p>
    <p>
     Too much is not good for points, and too little is not good for building the fire with.
    </p>
    <p>
     That length of time the points are closed and open is the "dwell" and is controlled by the gap in the points.
    </p>
    <p>
     If the points are closed too long, they don't get the spark to the plug at the right time for the piston.
    </p>
    <p>
     The spark shows up too late, well the piston left without it! :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     Same as a too retarded timing on the dizzy spindle and low power to you.
    </p>
    <p>
     If the points are gapped too much, the spark will get there too soon. Notice how pinging is often the result of the points gap?
    </p>
    <p>
     So it might be worth your while to go check it, as long as you're out there changing oil anyway. :-)

     west there's still more dark out there!
