      It's still raining and my heads are coming along nicely.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm bored, so I sat down and wrote another item of ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I finished the List piece on the Piston and horsepower, I went looking for the efficiency of the over-all engine versus the theoretical.
    </p>
    <p>
       This, I felt would give me a look at friction and unbalanced mass etc., all in one fell swoop.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time I discounted for the alternator,(3-5hp)and the fan, (10hp at max rpm) I had such a small number left that it really didn't mean anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe the pitiful number I had left is the friction and maybe it's not. I'm a failure as an automotive engineer.  :-)
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the numbers above are estimates I've heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you think about all the other forces and heat sources involved, friction really is insignificant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, we need to know what's happening down there, right?
    </p>
    <p>
      Paid big bucks for that engine and want it to be happy, right?
    </p>
    <p>
      The journal bearing has been around since the caveman.
    </p>
    <p>
      He invented it to please the women-folk I suppose. Along with the wheel. Dragging that sled was a bummer.
    </p>
    <p>
      They tried replacing it with roller bearings, it isn't any better. Won't even go as fast as I recall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Basically  the bearing never touches the babbit lining while running.
    </p>
    <p>
      It surfs on a layer of oil about .001 thick or more and squishes any excess out the sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      I say "surf" because that really is the condition. Nose up and riding the wave.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is an automatic feature when you have a shaft a couple thousandths smaller than the bearing. Along with a good supply of oil to ride on.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the piston sleeves, you'll find a taper at the bottom to pick up that oil. And drop out the crap I think.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am  not going to tell you about what oil to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has become a religion with people and I don't want any cross-burning on my front lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we have four pretty hefty main journals on the crank, four big diameter but skinny ones on the rod ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four more little but long long long ones on the wrist or "gudgeon" pins.
    </p>
    <p>
      They have done their job for a lot longer than I've had reason to think about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you come out in the morning and start up, the journals are all sitting right on the babbit liners.
    </p>
    <p>
      One point contact. Metal to metal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's look at that.
    </p>
    <p>
      You fire up and it takes from 10-30 seconds to get oil to the journals.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you've been good, maybe less, if not, then maybe longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was some in there but we're talking "up to pressure".
    </p>
    <p>
      For that average of 20 seconds the steel crank etc is just scraping along on the babbit. Little bit of oil from last nite, no help.
    </p>
    <p>
      The babbit liner is a lubricating material itself or you'd hear some terrible noise back there. It tends to "spall" from pressure.(flake)
    </p>
    <p>
      Babbit has also been around since "almost caveman".
    </p>
    <p>
      They change the alloy a bit every once in a great while but it's still basically the same stuff your grandfather used.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, you are wearing it away every time you start the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's fact Jack, the law, the big T. You can not stop it it keeps right on doing it no matter who you pray to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that same liner is the one I so carefully put in there with plasti-gage check and it was about .004", pretty good. Within tolerance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Truth here- those are the damn bearings I bought and they have nothing better.
    </p>
    <p>
      It could have been 1-1/2 thou. according to the book. Thats' the minimum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twenty seconds at 900 rpm, thats about 300 revs on the metal.
    </p>
    <p>
      You know those people who come out on the cold morning and as soon as it starts they wind it up to 4000? " It warms up faster" they say.
    </p>
    <p>
      They got you there bud. Metal on metal does get hot faster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Getting on with the tale,
    </p>
    <p>
      The side clearance, between the rod bearing and the crank?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about ten thousandths, min is .004" and max is up to .028 including the wear limit. The piston holds it in place, why worry?
    </p>
    <p>
      That's where the oil squishes out, big deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      It also controls how much oil pressure there is for the surfer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, well talk about particulates. That's a nice word for all kinds of crap.
    </p>
    <p>
      You got an air filter on your carby? Is it a good one?
    </p>
    <p>
      You know those engine seals Bob is always on your case about?
    </p>
    <p>
      The sand dune boys change oil and all filters after every days run.
    </p>
    <p>
      The off-roaders change the oil every time they have a pit stop and that was just to get a new air filter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because all of that dirt and sand ends up in the crankcase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there's just plain carbon. The black stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stuff you use to gauge when it's time to change the oil.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look, it isn't even black yet"!
    </p>
    <p>
      These are all sold under the general category of "abrasives".
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we segue into generalities:   
    </p>
    <p>
ԁ    All engines, be they from Detroit or Italy or Japan or even Germany are all built of the same materials and components.
    </p>
    <p>
      All but one, have oil filters. OK, so maybe there's others.  :-)
    </p>
    <p>
      Go ask one of these bush mechanics or even a real professional in the rest of the trade what the symptoms of low oil pressure mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      He'll talk to you, we're all in this together.
    </p>
    <p>
      He will not tell you about a bad oil pump, or get a bigger one, or oil relief valves, or your pick-up tube may be flummoxed by energy beams from alien space ships.
    </p>
    <p>
      They're a possibility but remote.
    </p>
    <p>
      What he will say is "your bearings are shot, guy".
    </p>
    <p>
      I have a feeling he's right.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you can't buy that, go ask your grandfather.
