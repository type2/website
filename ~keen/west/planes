     More fluff to fill the void here.
    </p>
    <p>
     While over having Christmas dinner with family, brother has me going with him to find the "Beagle Sky-Ranch".
    </p>
    <p>
     Have I told you he's an ex- bush-pilot and crop-duster?
    </p>
    <p>
     That's why he's a gimp. Dropped a plane on himself in a cherry orchard.
    </p>
    <p>
     So he's thinking about flying again. He quits for a few years and swears never again and then...
    </p>
    <p>
     There are no signs to the Beagle Sky-ranch, if you don't know where it is, you have no business .. etc.
    </p>
    <p>
     We finally spot a plane behind a house so we know we're close. Make a left turn there and head on down looking for more sign.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is just a bunch of houses where pilots live and a big old cow field with a wind sock and lighted wind tee.
    </p>
    <p>
     Planes sticking out of garages, under tarps etc.
    </p>
    <p>
     Log cabin with a pair of wings stored on top.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is one parking area where there were four or five tied down. One nice looking Stearman.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is one guy who actually has a three bay hanger that looks like a hanger.
    </p>
    <p>
     The road in is mud. If you don't have a 4 wheeler or a high struttin' volkswagen you really don't want to.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alan tells me the FAA came down on them a couple years ago and they ran them off.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's more likely the FAA left in disgust. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course this is a volkswagen story!
    </p>
    <p>
     There were two home-builts out in the field with our famous little engine in them.
    </p>
    <p>
     They turn it around so the flywheel end is pointing out and stick some kind of gear-box on the end and then a propeller.
    </p>
    <p>
     Looks pretty slick. No smog stuff at all. Only one had a cowling.
    </p>
    <p>
     We didn't get out of the van, it's not appropo, considering.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alan mentioned that the flywheel nut that holds it all on makes some people nervous but that the nut holding the rotor on his helicopter wasn't much bigger.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's known as the "Jesus nut" for obvious reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
     He said a lot of home-builts are using the vw engine these days and getting some hellacious horsepower out of them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Cost reasons mainly.
    </p>
    <p>
     We talked about losing a head and how the Lycoming has a bolted flange around the base. I hadn't known that.
    </p>
    <p>
     He's talking about an ultra-light build since there is no way in hell they will give him a license any more.
    </p>
    <p>
     They don't care if he's crippled but they draw the line on his bad eyesight.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then we talked about the price of Rotacs, that's another engine, and I mentioned how they were cutting the v-dubs in half for that purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
     So he's interested in that.
    </p>
    <p>
     I know there are some other air-heads out there so I may be querying you this coming year for some details.
    </p>
    <p>
     So if a fat man with no beard comes down your chimney or thru your roof some time in the next year, it won't be Santa, just Alan on his test flight. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, and if he does have a big bag, call me immediately. :-)
