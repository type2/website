     <p>
      I just had my 77 camper engine rebuilt. The shop that did the work strongly recommends 30W oild for air-cooled engines. The temperture is hovering around zero and my camper doesn't want to start. Some of the problem is attributable to a balky battery that goes from 12.3 to 6.5 upon starting. &lt;big snip&gt;

     I think it's a reasonable assumption that you need a new battery with some decent Cold Cranking Amps or even a second battery.
    </p>
    <p>
     CCA is supposed to mean the cranking amps at "0" degrees F. Don't bet your life on it tho.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are a number of things you should look at first and they are all electrical contacts and grounds. Check them at the cold time.
    </p>
    <p>
     At "0" degrees, there is very little chemical reaction going on anywhere in the world. That's why food stays relatively fresh.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is no different in your battery.
    </p>
    <p>
     Old memory tells me a 30% efficiency at that temp. (don't quote me)
    </p>
    <p>
     You have a fresh rebuild and if they did it right it's a relatively tight engine right now. The cold just makes it tighter.
    </p>
    <p>
     Third verse: Multi-viscosity oils are tested at 10 degrees above their rating (more old memory cells) meaning that 10W is tested for viscosity at 20 degrees.
    </p>
    <p>
     That means the oil will flow thru an orfice I can't remember size in 10 seconds. The size of the orfice is the "Saybolt orfice".
    </p>
    <p>
     So the viscosity is ten "Seconds Saybolt Universal". SSU.
    </p>
    <p>
     That 10W is supposed to mean it can be run at 10 degrees F.
    </p>
    <p>
     The other number as in 10W-30 means it will have a comparable viscosity to 30 weight at 180 degrees. (old mem cells)
    </p>
    <p>
     Above the 180 they go to hell in a hurry and won't compare with single weight oils.
    </p>
    <p>
     If I could get 5W-30 or 40, I would probably use that at those temps and with your problems.
    </p>
    <p>
     If your oil light starts flickering at you at operating temps, then you've gone too far and you need to thicken the oil up some.
