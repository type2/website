     "I've been tricked!" he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
     They really should have said something in the manual.
    </p>
    <p>
     While I was out in the South China Seas fighting for God, Country and The American Stock Exchange, the Krafty Krauts were home plotting to make me look bad in the '90s.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, I put a sand seal on this case I'm working, for the reasons most of us know about.
    </p>
    <p>
     It pulls in air and dirt with it. That sounds dumb eh?
    </p>
    <p>
     In other cases it blows oil from too much blow-by.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, I was doing some reading on the smog stuff since we need to know that, and stumbled on the reason it was sucking air.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another "clue", is there is a type3 head out there that has an air inlet tube built right into the rocker arm cavity.
    </p>
    <p>
     What's going on here? No manufactuer will even drill a hole if he can help it.  (heavy sigh, look of bewilderment)
    </p>
    <p>
      Positive Crankcase Ventilation (PCV) isn't just there for Tree-huggers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It pulls off nasty fumes etc and blow-by and sucks them up into the carby and burns them.
    </p>
    <p>
      You want to get that moisture out of there, right? How?
    </p>
    <p>
      My engine likes this. Keeps some of the "nasties" from becoming acids in the oil for instance. Cuts down on varnish and sludge build up. Eliminates gas fumes.
    </p>
    <p>
      There's even a percentage of oil that "bonds" to oxygen while being whipped around in there and those are no good now either.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oxidation"!  Same as rust only different.
    </p>
    <p>
      I want them out of there!
    </p>
    <p>
      The way all this PCV works is there's a partial vacuum or "negative pressure" created by the hose that runs from the air-cleaner to the Oil fill tube.
    </p>
    <p>
      It gets positive pressure from the blow-by and any more air it needs it pulls in thru that pulley shaft.
    </p>
    <p>
      Voila! we have thru-ventilation!  Rauf die ne naza! as my wife used to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      So one, I have to run that hose to my air-cleaner, and two, I imagine I'll put an inlet on the rocker covers with an air cleaner on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or I could tap a hole into the top of the casting like the type3 job I spoke of and leave the covers alone. Of course then I'll probably have to modify sheet metal :-(
    </p>
    <p>
      Three, you need that rubber boot that goes on the "road tube" off the oil fill tube. The one that runs down to the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      If that rubber boot isn't on there or in bad condition, it breaks the vacuum you had going for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      I just cured some of you guys "blow-by problems, hey?  :-)
    </p>
    <p>
      The story wouldn't be complete if I didn't talk about the non-existent "PCV valve" we never had.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's just a check valve with a light spring in it. Sets in the vacuum side of this system.
    </p>
    <p>
      The big iron 8's at least, draw so much vacuum at idle, that the PCV setup can draw so much fumes it affects the idle mixture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The PCV valve takes care of that. It pulls against the spring and closes down partway. Some others just have an orfice restriction.
    </p>
    <p>
      So this child will go find one, on the off chance it might be needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is possible that the little rubber booty we spoke of handles this.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wouldn't put it past them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This may be of some impact on you California guys passing Smog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just slip it in the line that goes to the air cleaner up underneath where it can't be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now if I can get that fool in front of me on the freeway to stop blowing his pollutants into the path of my engines air supply.
    </p>
    <p>
      His crap is being sucked right into my engine! The man has no conscience! Arrest that man!
    </p>
    <p>
      Never mind the guy behind me, that's his problem.  :-)
