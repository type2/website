    <p>
     Sitting around listening to the rains . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     Any of you ever think you'd like to live on a mountain by<br/>
     yourself and let the world go to hell in it's own fashion,<br/>
     should know that today was "dig out the drainage ditches<br/>
     day". The knee-hi rubber boots . . big ole' shovel . .  :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     Gonna do the CV Joints . .  actually, I already have but<br/>
     for as many as have, I bet there are more who haven't.
    </p>
    <p>
     I originally thought I had a cracked boot, turns out I<br/>
     didn't but that's cool. The bug was probably giving me a<br/>
     "near future" perspective.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the vehicle in this tale is a bug, the vans are mainly<br/>
     the same only bigger I think. You'll tell me if I'm wrong ?  :-)
    </p>
    <p>
      Off to the FLAPS, "new boots and give me one of those CV<br/>
     joint 12 point socket gee-whizzes".
    </p>
    <p>
     I mentioned before that I rejected one of the boots he set<br/>
     on the counter. . . it was lighter and appeared flimsier<br/>
     than the others.  He sold them to the next guy that came<br/>
     in the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     They also sell split boots that don't require pulling a<br/>
     cv joint, never seen one except in a magazine. . don't<br/>
     approve of them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Old cv boots were 2 piece with two clamps to hold them in<br/>
     place.
    </p>
    <p>
     The new ones are one piece and are said not to even<br/>
     require a "pinch clamp" out on the little end around the<br/>
     axle shaft. A pinch clamp is like a hose clamp. Only different  :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     I re-used the small clamp anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
     What I understand is that after some unknown date, they<br/>
     put a ridge on the axle shaft, that fits just inside the<br/>
     small end of the boot when installed. If you don't have<br/>
     said ridge, then you MUST use the small pinch clamp.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tools: the cv joint socket (12 pt mentioned), a small or narrow screw-<br/>
     driver to open up the pinch clamps and get down in the socket head<br/>
     screws to get the crud out, 3/8" ratchet and a short extension,<br/>
     3/8" breaker bar, 3 cans of brake or carb cleaner, 15 oz., 3 rolls<br/>
     of paper towels, a coffee can with a few inches of your favorite<br/>
     cheap solvent, gas is fine with me, a stiff parts brush . . . .<br/>
     baggies for each cv joint,wire brush, small chisel or drift pin,<br/>
     this is to knock the Boot shield off the back of the cv bearing<br/>
     itself, oh yeah. . and two hammers, one small to hit the chisel and<br/>
     one large to press the bearing off the shaft, and a big honking<br/>
     vise to put it in while you do that. . couple of boards to protect<br/>
     the shaft from the vise jaws. A big ole drift pin to knock the<br/>
     shaft of the cv joint, about 7/8" and about 6" long.
    </p>
    <p>
     And a pound of cv joint grease (moly filled). I used a can of<br/>
     Valvoline. The pound can sells for about the same as one of the<br/>
     little tubes they peddle.
    </p>
    <p>
     Each little tube is 112 grams I think, you need 90 grams per joint<br/>
     it says in Bentley but I see the Haynes for a transporter says 70<br/>
     grams.
    </p>
    <p>
     A pound is 453 grams so 1/4 is 113 and change. You just put a tad<br/>
     less than 1/4 the can in each joint/bearing.
    </p>
    <p>
     This is suddenly looking like one of those jobs you'd rather have<br/>
     someone else do, even if you have to pay money.
    </p>
    <p>
     This is also a very important piece of machinery to you. . .<br/>
     This is one of the four points where the power hits the pavement. .<br/>
     And the pavement hits back.
    </p>
    <p>
     Where I have a choice, meaning I also know how to do the job, I just<br/>
     can't let "Joe Gas-pump" clean, inspect, repack and reinstall my<br/>
     cv joints.  Ask yourself if you'd let him pack your parachute.  :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     So it's kind of a personal thing, I don't do "surprises" well any more.
    </p>
    <p>
     The first move is obviously to get the car up in the air some degree<br/>
     that makes it easy for you to crawl under there, don't skimp.
    </p>
    <p>
     I ran mine up on ramps and did most of the work from that position.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once you have it in the air, get down there and look around, then get<br/>
     into the paper towels and wipe all the crap that might be anywhere in<br/>
     the area of the joints when you put them back in. No crap is allowed.
    </p>
    <p>
     It would be nice to get a pressure cleaner in there but not always one<br/>
     in your shop. Or there along-side the road.
    </p>
    <p>
     I had sprayed pernetrating oil all over the joints the day before but<br/>
     I doubt that it does much good.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now that you have the immediate areas "spruced up", get that little<br/>
     screw-driver and dig out the sockets in the socket heads.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then take one of the spray cans of cleaner (carb/brake) and put the<br/>
     plastic straw in the nozzle. Put said nozzle right in the socket head<br/>
     and give it a short blast or two.
    </p>
    <p>
     Get some in your eyes? I ain't your momma, if you need help in<br/>
     looking out for yourself, you shouldn't be under there.   :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     Clean out all the sockets like that and then start breaking them all<br/>
     loose with the breaker bar and 12 point.
    </p>
    <p>
     I (laughingly) suggest the breaker bar in lieu of just a ratchet<br/>
     because they are torqued to at least 25 ft/lbs and thats a little<br/>
     hard on ratchet teeth. Did you block the wheels?
    </p>
    <p>
     Switch to the ratchet and pull them all out but a top one on each<br/>
     end. Back those top ones off till you can turn them on out with<br/>
     your fingers. Need a container for this hardware. Can or what?
    </p>
    <p>
     Now you finger out the last two screws while balancing this thing<br/>
     simultaneously, tugging it out of the slight cup it sits in on<br/>
     each end. You need three hands but most of us only have two so you<br/>
     fake it. . . or you don't . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     Getting it down from there is not the problem, not getting wounded<br/>
     is the problem.  :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     It's pretty easy really. .
    </p>
    <p>
     So now you have one whole axle assembly in your hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lay it down on your work bench or whatever and use the screw-driver<br/>
     to open up the pinches in the small pinch-clamp.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pull those two small ones back off the rubber neck there. . .
    </p>
    <p>
     Now stand the whole assy up on end and while holding the joint<br/>
     square, use that drift pin/chisel to knock the metal shield<br/>
     of the boot off the back of the joint/bearing.
    </p>
    <p>
     You give it a rap and then turn it 90 degrees and give it another<br/>
     rap, working your way around until it finally falls off there.
    </p>
    <p>
     As you go along with this, wipe all that grease up you can get at.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pull that one boot down the shaft to get it clear of the joint.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some of the cv joints are said to have a ball shaped cup over the<br/>
     outer end as a cover, if you have one there it says to pry it out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mine didn't have one so I was looking right in the joint/bearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The CV Joint/Bearing:<br/>
     There are four different parts to the thing, an inner ring that is<br/>
     splined to the axle shaft, the balls, an inner cage that holds the<br/>
     balls, and an outer ring that has the holes in it that the capscrews<br/>
     go thru to fasten it to the wheel stub shaft.
    </p>
    <p>
     Similar to any other ball bearing but this one doesn't rotate around<br/>
     the shaft, all it does is wobble.<br/>
     Do not wobble it more than 15 degrees. It will come apart on you.
    </p>
    <p>
     We still need to get this pup off the shaft . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     If you've wiped some of that grease off the end, you'll see a<br/>
     snap ring there on the end of the shaft holding the cv joint<br/>
     on . . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     Get a regular pair of snap ring pliers and slip it off there.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here's one of my down points, I immediately flipped the snap<br/>
     ring off into the brush, never to be seen again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Naturally none of the flaps had them, and so on . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     Once you have the snap ring off, you set the joint up in your<br/>
     vice or press so that the inner ring that the splines are in,<br/>
     is supported. Do not try to drive it off there by supporting<br/>
     on any other part of the bearing, you'll be putting those<br/>
     hammer blows thru the balls and cage and will damage your<br/>
     bearing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Set up so the shaft can slide thru my vise loosely but the teeth<br/>
     of the vise support the inner ring mentioned above, I pressed<br/>
     the shaft out of the bearing.
    </p>
    <p>
     I used the vise and the handle of my floor jack (7/8"drift pin)<br/>
     and hit it square and solid with my ten pound hammer.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It", being the shaft, walked right out of the cv joint.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had placed a board on the ground below the vise for it to fall on.<br/>
     If you have a friend to hold it you won't need one.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a spring washer on the shaft under the center section<br/>
     of the bearing you just drove off. Note the way the spring is<br/>
     installed. Remove this washer and save.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you have old cv joints, the spline may be loose enough to<br/>
     just fall out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now you have one cv joint off the shaft and can remove both the<br/>
     old boots from that end.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before you pull the boots clear off, take a measurement from the<br/>
     bearing/joint and the little end of the boot.
    </p>
    <p>
     You need to put the new ones back to the same location.<br/>
     That puts the small end of the boot in the proper location<br/>
     relative to that ridge on the shaft I mentioned earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will also place the boot in it's proper place even if your shafts<br/>
     don't have a ridge.<br/>
     While I doubt if compressing the boot folds in too close would do much<br/>
     damage, stretching it out too far could lead to stress and premature<br/>
     failure. I'm talking about the rubber folds in the bellows here.  :-)
    </p>
    <p>
      OK, you got one bearing off and both boots are off. . take a smoke<br/>
     break. . .  or beer , etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now take the can of cheap solvent and the parts brush and clean the<br/>
     bearings of all existing grease and grime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now take a can of the spray cleaner and blow them out to get the last<br/>
     bits of grease and trash.
    </p>
    <p>
      Get a baggy on them NOW . . . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Inspection: Primarily, when you twist the bearing around the shaft<br/>
     while holding said shaft, there should be no slop.<br/>
      The balls are all round . .  :-) should be no surface defects on the<br/>
     balls and they should all be shiny bright.<br/>
      The balls actually snap into the center ring and hold themselves there on<br/>
     an unworn bearing/joint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that the bearings/joints are clean, wipe down the new boots,<br/>
     rinse if necessary to remove any dirt or dust. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Put a little bit of lube on the axle shaft and put on the new boots.<br/>
     One facing the still installed joint and one facing towards the joint<br/>
     you pulled off. Don't forget to get those pinch clamps in there between<br/>
     the two boots.<br/>
      Leave the boots both back towards the center of the shaft where they<br/>
     won't get in your way while you grease the joints.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wipe any grease or dirt off the shaft.<br/>
     CLEAN is the word from here on out.
    </p>
    <p>
      This will seem amusing or annoying depending on your temperment about<br/>
     here. . . you personally will be in grease up to your tits . .  :-)
    </p>
    <p>
      Had a kid worked for me that could do worse than this and never get<br/>
     dirty above his wrists. . the world took umbrage at that and had him<br/>
     killed.  . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Put that spring washer back on the shaft, the offset center mates<br/>
     with the shoulder on the shaft.
    </p>
    <p>
      Re-install the one joint you took off, making sure orientation is right.<br/>
     The reduced end of the bearing is outside, the big end where you should be<br/>
     able to see the ring of where the boot cap was, goes inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      You re-install by gently starting it with the flat of your 10 lb<br/>
     hammer and hitting it squarely with the face of your hammer till<br/>
     it is flush with the end of the shaft.
    </p>
    <p>
     Your shaft end should be sitting on something like a concrete floor<br/>
     with a 2/4 that the shaft sits on.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now I used the 46mm socket that would fit over the shaft and<br/>
     hammered it on home by hitting the back of the socket.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are home when you have that snap ring groove flush with the<br/>
     shoulder of the bearing center section.
    </p>
    <p>
     Install the snap ring and be damned sure you have it in the groove.<br/>
     If it's not quite going get on the big socket and hammer again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blow the bearing out again, lightly, and bag it while you round up the<br/>
     grease and some newspapers to sit this on.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will mention two caveats here. In the process of greasing my third<br/>
     bearing, I tipped the damn bearing too much and it wouldn't go back<br/>
     together. . . nothing would make it.
    </p>
    <p>
     I had to dis-assemble that one joint from the shaft again, clean it up<br/>
     and take it in the house on the table where I could look at the picture in<br/>
     the "Bentley" manual and orient the bearing just so . . and it fell back<br/>
     together. I looked in my Haynes to see what it had . . nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second caveat is that grinding compound is nothing more than grit<br/>
     in grease. You got grease and you have dirt and dust.<br/>
     It's way too easy to make grinding compound while you're greasing these<br/>
     bearings. This will then eat your bearings as you go down the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back to the job:  set your axle assy up so a bearing is sitting on the news<br/>
     paper and one end is straight up in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grab three fingers of grease out of the can and press it into the back of<br/>
     the bearing on the newspaper.  Fill it with grease all the way around.
    </p>
    <p>
      Right now you want about 1/3 of the 1/4 can allotted in the back of that<br/>
     bearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now grab the outer ring and pull it up and down. "Pumping the bearing".
    </p>
    <p>
      It will roll a lot of the grease back up, press it back down and pump<br/>
     some more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you get the 1/3 of the grease in that one side you can stop and<br/>
     turn it over so your greased bearing is in the air and the other side<br/>
     of the bearing is facing you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use the same method on this side and get 1/3 of 1/4 can in this side.<br/>
     Pumping and jamming. . :-)
    </p>
    <p>
      You will feel the bearing get harder to pump when the grease gets to it.<br/>
     Keep filling and pumping until you have 1/3 in each side and the bearing is<br/>
     real hard to pump.
    </p>
    <p>
      To re-cover what's going on here, you got a can, 1 pound of<br/>
     grapite grease and 1/4 of that is to go in each bearing.<br/>
     What I'm talking about above is that you should use 1/3 of that 1/4 can,or<br/>
     1/12 of the can in each side up till now. You will still have 1/3 of your<br/>
     allotment per bearing to put in later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ok, we have packed 1 bearing and there is another on the other end of<br/>
     this assembly. Leave the boots where they are and bag that bearing you<br/>
     greased.
    </p>
    <p>
      So let's do it all again on the other end. . .  :-)
    </p>
    <p>
      Now one assembly is done, do the other the same.<br/>
     Leave the boots back away from the bearing for now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now get back under the vehicle and clean out the area where the joints sit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wire brush all your hardware and 2 hole doublers. The two hole doublers are<br/>
     a flat plate that was under the screw head and over the back of the metal<br/>
     dust shield on the boot.
    </p>
    <p>
      It wouldn't kill you to clean those screw heads good and put a light<br/>
     coat of paint on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Re-installing the Axle assemblies:
    </p>
    <p>
      Keep those baggies on till the very last, take your assembly and crawl back<br/>
     under there for re-install.
    </p>
    <p>
      Get two of the bolts to hang this thing in there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pull the baggy for the top end of the assembly and push it up into<br/>
     place, starting one screw on top by hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now do the same with the lower end of the assembly. .  almost there!
    </p>
    <p>
      OK, both ends are hung by one bolt on the top of the flange and the<br/>
     boots are still back toward the center.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we get the grease can again. .  .<br/>
     Repack the grease there on the inside ends of the bearings, the two sides<br/>
     you can see. Now get a two finger scoop and pack it up in there over the<br/>
     bearing.  This is that last 1/3 we were talking about applying later. Don't<br/>
     get carried away but it should be a good heavy<br/>
     layer that doesn't get into the bellows area.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now get cleaned up again and move the boot down to it's installed<br/>
     position, remember the measurement we took for where the nipple end of<br/>
     the boot should go? Do that. . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you need to remove the one bolt you have for hanging and tweek the<br/>
     boot around until two opposing screws align the boot shield and the<br/>
     bearing bolt holes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Get the doublers and the bolts and do the deed, just hand tight for now.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a 25"dia tire these axles turn 1000 rpm at 73mph.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you noticed, the doublers on each end of the axles were on opposing<br/>
     patterns in order that their mass would cancel each other.<br/>
      If yours isn't that way, don't lay awake nites, just know that it could be<br/>
     better.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Doublers are there to reinforce the back of the dust shield<br/>
     forming an air tight seal across the back of the bearing.<br/>
     I might suggest that you put a light coat of grease across the back<br/>
     of the bearing there where it mates with the shield but you have grease all<br/>
     over and I expect there is more than enough already.
    </p>

      I won't mention anti-sieze either, :-)  there was enough of the<br/>
     moly-d grease in the bearing bolt holes to coat the threads and<br/>
     should do the same job as anti-sieze in this application.
    </p>
    <p>
      These bolts are not run-of-the-mill bolts either.<br/>
     They are torqued to 25 lb-ft as opposed to 18 for a bolt off the engine.
    </p>
    <p>
      I assume they are something like a SAE grade 8 bolt.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of which means . . . if you start substituting bolts, stay out of<br/>
     "Builders Supply".
    </p>
    <p>
      I have trouble calling these "bolts", properly they are "capscrews"<br/>
     until they get to be 1/2" dia.
    </p>
    <p>
     When you've got everything like it should be and the bolts are started.<br/>
     Tighten them to just seal the back of the dust shield to the<br/>
     bearing housing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now you get to squeeze the boots . . . :-)
    </p>
    <p>
      Grip the boot around the small end and then use your other hand to<br/>
     apply pressure to the bellows part.<br/>
      This presses all that grease you put in over the bearing, that last<br/>
     1/3, thru the bearing with air pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you can put those pinch-clamps on the small end of the boots if<br/>
     you're using them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I tightened all the bolts to just about 10 lb-ft. Just used the<br/>
     ratchet and feel. Use a criss-cross tightening pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had my vehicle up on tire stands till now, now I jacked up the side<br/>
     I was working on till it just cleared the stand. I need it to turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      My torque wrench is too big to get in around the axle except the bottom<br/>
     three bolts on each end.
    </p>
    <p>
      By raising the wheel off the tire stand, I could turn the wheel to get all<br/>
     the bolts on the bottom for torquing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other reason to have the wheel turning is also important, you want to<br/>
     spin the wheel and listen to those bearings.<br/>
      They should be totally silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you're sure everything is as it should be, you can finish torquing the<br/>
     bolts to 25 lb-ft.
    </p>
    <p>
      So still you're not done . .  :-)
    </p>
    <p>
      Get a can of hand cleaner and get under there again . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Clean all the grease off the boots and surrounding areas . . towels<br/>
     Now use the hand cleaner and clean all the grease off those rubber boots.<br/>
      You know that grease just rots rubber. . .<br/>
     If you want to be prissy, you can squirt them with your favorite<br/>
     "Armor-all" type stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you're done . .  go do the other side. . . :-)
