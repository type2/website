     Cheap Seats . . . Hookers . . . and Fire trucks
    </p>
    <p>
     Someone asked if there was a cheap way to rebuild a seat.
    </p>
    <p>
     I built a cheap seat once . . . it's still out in my bug.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's about seven colors but it rides real fine.
    </p>
    <p>
     With the seat covers on, it looks as sharp as any do.
    </p>
    <p>
     The tale . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     Laying up in Lancaster, California. There along the railroad tracks that parallel the main road between Lancaster and Palmdale. The T-bird Motel or some other famous name . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     Hookers and pimps and drug-pushers with a strong dose of the law.
    </p>
    <p>
     $106 a week will get you room with hot water and a change of towels every week. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     Every nite is a circus extravaganza that goes on till dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
     My friend lived in a room up front next to the hookers.
    </p>
    <p>
     They like the front rooms where they can just hang out the door and watch the traffic.
    </p>
    <p>
     He had a dog, Brandy, that needed a couple of walks a day and we would do this together for protection or some such.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's an interesting way of life if you'd like to visit there.
    </p>
    <p>
     Cheap rooms and . . . :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     Back behind the Motel is a carpet installation place.
    </p>
    <p>
     My main source of supply . . . :-) For the seats, people!
    </p>
    <p>
     The drivers seat is a piece of misery if you're in it more than a few minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
     I pulled it out and took it in my room.
    </p>
    <p>
     Stripped it down and found the cause of most my misery.
    </p>
    <p>
     The support bars for the back springs was broken and when I sat on it it sagged in the middle of my back.
    </p>
    <p>
     Borrowed the old mans propane torch and brazed that back in place.
    </p>
    <p>
     I wired all the coil springs and many of the back wavy springs together so that the load is distributed better.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now we need some fabric and stuffing, all that was in there originally is trash or gone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dumpster Diving is a recognized survival technique in that area so needless to say the Carpet Place supplied all the necessary stuffing and such.
    </p>
    <p>
     The material is brand new, I assume because the new buyer didn't like the carpet the seller had just put in, they would rip it all out and put some more new in.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is a felt, about 1/8" thick used for an underlay for the carpet so a roll of that will work against the springs. Cut a piece of heavy carpet with the jute back to put on the seat springs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then there is that blue sponge foam rubber, about 1/2" thick that also is used under the carpet of the better homes in the area. That is used to make all the formed stuffing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Get a can of 3M spray adhesive and just build it up as thick as you like.
    </p>
    <p>
     A pair of heavy duty scissors and a razor knife are all you need for the forming.
    </p>
    <p>
     Soon I had a well padded seat with some pretty fair material built up.
    </p>
    <p>
     If it's good enough to walk on, it ought to be good enough to sit on.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, I had carefully removed the original seat covers because I can't even afford the JCW jobs.
    </p>
    <p>
     The usual hole in the butt and across the shoulders etc.
    </p>
    <p>
     Around the corner in front, same area as the Carpet Place, is a shop that does boat seats and the like.
    </p>
    <p>
     He has the Naugahyde material to fix the covers with . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     He's a tightwad and has nothing in his dumpster. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     I cut out the areas that need replaced, all the way to the existing seams.
    </p>
    <p>
     I carry that discard over to the shop and negotiate for Naugahyde and thread.
    </p>
    <p>
     For about a $1.50, I get all the material I need, not exactly the matching color but it's a better grade stuff than what came out. Scraps. As I recall, he gets about $20 a foot for it off the roll.
    </p>
    <p>
     I cut it to the shape of the old piece and using a sail makers needle and a pair of needle nose pliers I sewed in the new material, using the existing needle holes there along the seams.
    </p>
    <p>
     Where you can't use the old holes is the hard part. The holes are ripped out or whatever. The old material is like iron. I did break one needle getting it thru that stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
     I should mention that the sailmaker needles came from the 98 cent store.
    </p>
    <p>
     You get a whole package for 98 cents, various sizes etc.
    </p>
    <p>
     Probably spent a week off and on sewing in these new pieces. Actual time is just a few hours but my hands would get tired.
    </p>
    <p>
     Or I'd get pissed. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     Total cost for repair of 2 front seats was under $5.
    </p>
    <p>
     I had a set of those pull-over cloth seat covers, cost about $10.
    </p>
    <p>
     They're still on there and the seats are as firm as the day I put them together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fire-trucks . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     The cops can't search a room if no-one will answer the door or there is no-one there. No probable cause . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     So what they do is call the fire-department and report a fire in Room xx....
    </p>
    <p>
     The Fire Department is not restricted by "probable cause". They can break the door down if necessary any place that has a reported fire.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course once the fire department gets in the police can follow etc.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not one of my best stories but hey . . . :-)
