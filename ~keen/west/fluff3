     Went down to Medford, 30 miles away. actually it's more than 60 for a round trip. Any of you notice how it can be farther in one direction than the other? That's what the signs say.
    </p>
    <p>
     Went to the "Not so local FLAPS". Needed the swivel foot adjusters.
    </p>
    <p>
     Someone who shall remain nameless but who's initials start with Bob suggested I put them in. In fairness, it's my decision no-one elses.
    </p>
    <p>
     While passing by the "Truck Stop", I see this big sign.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Economy Special, Oil Change $99.95" That's for trucks.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now you know why the freight is so high.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still it made me feel warm dowm in my "good spot". :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     Got the lifters and had a chat on various, freight for instance. Told "him" we called them "flaps" and it's meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
     We also talked about the "List" and whether he should get on the "Net". He, like many, is computer illiterate.
    </p>
    <p>
     Got my "senior discount", that's where I threaten him with a heart-attack right on his premises if I don't get it wholesale. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     I'll get into the installation when I do the rest of the VTG stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
     Came with 8 shims tho. Still may not be enough on these heads.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the way back, I stopped at "Brothers" , as in "family".
    </p>
    <p>
     He's always good for "grounding" oneself back to reallity.
    </p>
    <p>
     He's out working on the VW van.
    </p>
    <p>
     He does everything wrong and they still run.
    </p>
    <p>
     No therm-flaps in shroud. In fact it hasn't been too long ago that I told him about them. He actually called Bergman to verify that.
    </p>
    <p>
     So he decided it was running too cold and put a "power pulley" on.
    </p>
    <p>
     Slow the fan down etc.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oil blows out all over, it's a mess. No crankcase ventilation at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     It has the type 1 tin on it so there are huge areas open to the road all around the engine.
    </p>
    <p>
     I suggested he at least take it down and blow the dirt off.
    </p>
    <p>
     He says it helps keep it warm, he'll do that in the Spring.
    </p>
    <p>
     He's wiping the "mayonaise" out of the filler cap. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     Carburetor is off a Ford something, picked it up at a junkyard.
    </p>
    <p>
     Has a little beer can size paper filter on it that looks about 3/4 plugged. I suggested he replace it. He looked and declared it "fine".
    </p>
    <p>
     In Baja maybe. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     He does have an external filter on it, but it ties in where the oil cooler is supposed to be and there is no external cooler.
    </p>
    <p>
     I told him about my "Rocker" problems and he laughed . Far as he's concerned, if it goes "click-click, it's in good shape.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some comment about hobbies becoming a religion. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     This engine he has in there is the same case he towed across the State of Arizona in first gear. Total melt-down. Warped bad.
    </p>
    <p>
     He took the case and stuck the crank and cam back in with some old bearings, pulled it closed within a 1/2 inch and stuck it in the oven at 450 degrees. About 4 hours later he pulled it out and finshed pulling it closed with the bolts and stuck it back in for another 4 hours.
    </p>
    <p>
     The smoke from the oiley case ran them clear out of the house for several hours.
    </p>
    <p>
     He says it's a great way to clean cases.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then he had the crank journals line-bored, the cam bearing saddles he just left. It was cranky at first when he re-assembled but it wore in.
    </p>
    <p>
     He has 27,000 miles on this engine now and he loves it.
    </p>
    <p>
     I headed on home with a different perspective of VW's. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     For gods sake don't try any of this stuff yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
     I personally couldn't get 5 miles down the road with that kind of action.
