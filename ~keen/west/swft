 The answer is not so simple, I got a post somewhere on that but I
can't recall  . .

 See the thickness of the swivel foot itself? I think that's about what I
came out with, 3/16" as I recall. I compromised on 1/8".

My pushrods were new tho and I cut them  1/4" longer than the old ones to
make all the monkey motion work like I planned it.

You put a like amount of shims under the square mounting block. Just
slide them over the studs sticking out of the head.

 If you are going to use existing pushrods, you may not be able to be
so prissy.

 Since you're using existing pushrods the real proof is when you
reach up in there to adjust or the swivel foot sits in the wrong
place on the end of the valve stem.
