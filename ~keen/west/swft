       Hi... just need a quick question answered...I have a 1600 Type 3 fuel injected engine sitting on my kitchen table that I am in the process of rebuilding. The heads are on and I am considering whether to install a set of swivel foot adjusters that a friend has given me (no instructions included).
      </p>
      <p>
       If I do install them, how are the shims situated? They are rectangle shaped so which way does the long edge face?
      </p>
      <p>
       Any help will be greatly appreciated!
      </p>

      The answer is not so simple, I got a post somewhere on that but I can't recall . .
     </p>
     <p>
      See the thickness of the swivel foot itself? I think that's about what I came out with, 3/16" as I recall. I compromised on 1/8".
     </p>
     <p>
      My pushrods were new tho and I cut them 1/4" longer than the old ones to make all the monkey motion work like I planned it.

      You put a like amount of shims under the square mounting block. Just slide them over the studs sticking out of the head.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you are going to use existing pushrods, you may not be able to be so prissy.
     </p>
     <p>
      Since you're using existing pushrods the real proof is when you reach up in there to adjust or the swivel foot sits in the wrong place on the end of the valve stem.
