     The "gates of hell" is not about a bar in Pacoima, that's the other place.
    </p>
    <p>
     This is about the valves in the combustion chamber of your car or van engine.
    </p>
    <p>
     I read up on it because I wanted a better understanding and I hope some of you might feel the same way.
    </p>
    <p>
     This isn't a fix your car thing. But it may explain why you need to fix it sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are other kinds of engines that don't have valves per se, but yours does.
    </p>
    <p>
     This is the world famous VW aircooled flat four!
    </p>
    <p>
     There are two types of valves in the head of the combustion chamber, an intake valve and an exhaust valve.
    </p>
    <p>
     The intake lets the gasoline/air mix into the chamber and the exhaust lets the burnt gas fumes out of the chamber after it's exploded and pushed the piston along it's path toward the crankshaft.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the VW aircooled, 4 cylinder puppy, it does one of each every other stroke. This is called a 2 stroke engine.
    </p>
    <p>
     Looking at the exhaust valve first will explain the most so that's our plan.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the beginning of the intake stroke, during the overlap period (has to do with the camshaft) it is subjected to a chilling blast of fuel-laden air, then it is slammed closed with a force from 100 to 400 lbs, probably bouncing a couple times on it's seat that may or may not have carbon granules imbedded in it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then it is blasted with a hot flame, hot enough to melt aluminum, then it is yanked off the seat while this is still going on and brought to a temperature ranging from 1300-1800 deg.F., depending on where you measure it, and then it gets hit with the cold blast of fuel/air again.
    </p>
    <p>
     This whole cycle happens from 850 to 5500 times a minute and three/fourths of the time when it's not doing that, it's supposed to form a gas seal that will contain pressures from 100 to as much as 1800 psi. Have you lapped your valves lately?
    </p>
    <p>
     The intake valve is expected to do much the same but it doesn't get nearly as much of the heat.
    </p>
    <p>
     What about the spark plug?
    </p>
    <p>
     It is subjected to the heat and pressures but none of the beating and you take it out and throw it away every tune-up.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now to add insult to the extreme injury:
    </p>
    <p>
     Neither valve recieves any direct cooling from the engine cooling system.
    </p>
    <p>
     The heat crawls up the valve stem and is passed to the heads thru the valve guides and then on to the engine oil but it's pathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
     You know those sloppy valve guides you left in there? Less contact with the stem means you have even less cooling.
    </p>
    <p>
     That oil you think is flowing down the valve stem to lubricate is carburizing and forming an insulation in the valve guide.
    </p>
    <p>
     Cooling of the intake valve is pretty good from the continual flow of air/fuel from the outside, but the exhaust valve, except for a brief chill in the overlap period recieves no cooling whatsoever unless you want to call a 1300 deg. gas cool. It's cherry red.
    </p>
    <p>
     If it makes 1800F. you get auto-ignition.
    </p>
    <p>
     A note here in that the higher your compression, the hotter that package of flame is.
    </p>
    <p>
     The duty imposed on the simplest valve head, when compared to any other part of the engine is mind boggling.
