    <p>
     Roadkill Electronics or how we come to know Kirchoff.
    </p>
    <p>
     I think this will be a new series on electrical stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ben Franklin, the dicoverer was our kind of guy.
    </p>
    <p>
     You all know the story, he's out flying a damn kite in a lightning storm with the house key up the string.
    </p>
    <p>
     That was to keep the housekeeper locked out, kind of mess with her mind thing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ben is humming something that faintly resembles "reach up... and touch the sky"
    </p>
    <p>
     Zap! goes the lightning, Zing! goes Bens muscles, Whizz! goes the trousers trout, right down his leg.
    </p>
    <p>
     Definitely a man ahead of his time.
    </p>
    <p>
     The housekeeper quit, right then and there.
    </p>
    <p>
     He was the Ambassador to Europe at the time, so he's hangin' with the guys at the old Savoy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some of the guys were Ohm, Ampere, and Count Etcha Volt.
    </p>
    <p>
     He tells them the story and they all got a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
     I'm not sure whether Galvani was there or not.
    </p>
    <p>
     So they all went home and played with it a while and wrote "papers" proclaiming their discovery and naming it after themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
     None of them had "real" jobs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Watt was an engineer and eventually had to clean up this mess and equate it to something real, like "horsepower".
    </p>
    <p>
     Well enough frivolous history.
    </p>
    <p>
     These numbers below are the ampacity of some of the wire sizes in our "small wonder" machines.
    </p>
    <p>
     In your manuals, under schematics, you will see some small numbers alongside the wires. Those are the metric sizes of the wire used.
    </p>
    <p>
     From that you can deduce what size fuse goes in your circuit.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, it is not "cool" to have all red ones in there.
    </p>
    <p>
     0.5mm: (.032") 5 amps&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.0mm: (.063") 15 amps<br/>
     0.75mm:(.029") 7 amps&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.5mm: (.071") 17 amps<br/>
     1.0mm: (.045") 9 amps&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.0mm: (.110") 35 amps<br/>
     1.5mm: (.055") 13 amps&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25mm : (.225") 80 amps
    </p>
    <p>
     Now we've done the academic thing we can get back to frivolity.
    </p>
    <p>
     This is a hypothetical situation and never happens to V-dubs, but you might stumble over some guy with a Maseratti and have to play "good samaritan".
    </p>
    <p>
     It's 2 a.m. in the middle of the corn-belt in Iowa, it's dark, it's raining and you're wearing sun glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
     He's daintily poking around under the dash when you arrive and ask the question.
    </p>
    <p>
     His windshield wipers are out.
    </p>
    <p>
     You mosey back to the van and get your trouble light etc. Coffee can full of tools.
    </p>
    <p>
     You poke up in there and do your magic act and come back out with the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Your wiper motor's shot, dude"
    </p>
    <p>
     Can't drive in this rain without one so you offer a ride.
    </p>
    <p>
     Won't leave his car in this terrible place.
    </p>
    <p>
     Offers money... hmmm.
    </p>
    <p>
     Over in the field is a '32 Packard, abandoned, so you wander over for a look.
    </p>
    <p>
     It has a windshield wiper motor, might still work.
    </p>
    <p>
     Back to the Maseratti and look at the physicals, hmmm, it's doable.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still need a resistor for the six volt motor, hmmm.
    </p>
    <p>
     Back over to the Packard where you do a dissection while you think about the other problem.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly a light goes on... and you remember Kirchoff.
    </p>
    <p>
     Kirchoff was a heavy who did some work on series circuits based on Ohms Law.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>Kirchoffs Laws</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     The resistance of a series combination is the sum of the resistance of the separate parts.
    </p>
    <p>
     Current thru a series combination is the same as the current thru each part.
    </p>
    <p>
     Voltage across a series combination is the sum of the voltages across the separate parts.
    </p>
    <p>
     You chuckle a little and step back and look at the tail-lights.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yes there's still one with a bulb. Looks ok.
    </p>
    <p>
     You hang the wiper motor in with two bolts, fix the mis-aligning and different size shafts with a piece of fuel hose and hose clamps.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now for the master-piece: you go back to the Packard and pull the tail-light socket and bulb and clean it up and wire it in series with the 6 volt motor.
    </p>
    <p>
     The guy is moaning by now but you continue on like a man maddened.
    </p>
    <p>
     Flip the power on and voila, wiper action. the wipers turn while the tail light burns.
    </p>
    <p>
     The guy gets back in his car gingerly, and with dubiety, it's been fixed by a V-dubber after all, smiles wanly, and peels out of there!
    </p>
    <p>
     You laugh hysterically for the next hundred miles. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     What Kirchoff says back there is if you stick 2 six volt loads in a 12 volt system they work just fine.
    </p>
    <p>
     A tail light bulb will probably carry 4 amps, about the same as a wiper motor so we should be alright there.
    </p>
    <p>
     The second law is the one that gives us the six volts.
    </p>
    <p>
     The third law says the amperage will be what it should be.
    </p>
