    <p>
     In a way I hate to bring this subject up.
    </p>
    <p>
     Everything from flames to total condemnation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still, bravery is another word for stupid isn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
     I'm working on an old case that has one thing going for it. It's never been bored and doesn't need it now according to my keen eye and straight edge.
    </p>
    <p>
     All the faying surfaces are totally black tho so I went to work with some medium emery cloth. By hand, I should add. This is not work for power tools of any kind.
    </p>
    <p>
     I carefully polished every surface and all bearing saddles.
    </p>
    <p>
     You know what the black stuff is? Aluminum Oxide. Know what your sharpening stone is made of? Samo Samo.
    </p>
    <p>
     Results: one area adjacent to the oil sump cover was pittedd so bad from water/acid, I had to get the dremel in and clean it all out and fill with J.B.W.
    </p>
    <p>
     The oil sump cover surface was also so pitted I ground some out and and then used the cover plate and coarse grinding compound to grind a new flat surface. It might have not leaked with lots of gaskets and permatex but it would have been a major pain.
    </p>
    <p>
     The mating case-half surfaces had three gouges across the face where some nice fellow had driven a screw driver or what to get the case apart. Filled those and carefully brought them down to the rest of the surface.
    </p>
    <p>
     Polished the case studs and the o-ring surfaces at the base.
    </p>
    <p>
     Polished the o-ring surfaces where the push rod tubes fit. Two of these were gouged by a screw driver. They were light enough I could polish them out. Had they not been, I'd of had a leak there.
    </p>
    <p>
     Polished the thrust bearing faying surfaces. I don't know for sure but I don't think the al.Oxide would stay there under load or if it did it would eat my thrust bearings.
    </p>
    <p>
     This Al-oxide is abrasive and brittle as one would expect. It's my opinion in areas of rotation or flex, it would spall off and go into the oil. Good bye bearings and gears.
    </p>
    <p>
     I think that doing this polishing in some areas might be unnecessary if lots of permatex is used but it has hidden primary purpose of giving an inch by inch inspection of every trouble spot.
    </p>
    <p>
     Next are the cam folower holes and the dizzy hole but I need to find some kind of burnishing tool to get in there. Anyone ever used one of those many-balls-on-a-stick jobbies?
    </p>
    <p>
     The floor is open to debate or suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
     I'll add a footnote that yes I'm going to have to clean every oil passage in the thing when I'm done.
