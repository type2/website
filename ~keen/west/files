    <p>
     One of the guys wanted me to do something on files.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not that kind, the kind that cut metal. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     I may, as I have some variety around here, but I thought I'd mention a file substitute I use a lot. No it's not a rock. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     It's called a "belt stick" or this big homker I made would have to be called a belt board, or club.
    </p>
    <p>
     The small ones, up to 3/4" wide are bought and are a spring loaded piece of plastic with a taper on one end and a round end on the other.
    </p>
    <p>
     They're 3/8 to 1/2" thick. 6,8 and 10 inches long.
    </p>
    <p>
     They are made to hold an abrasive belt, your choice of grit etc.
    </p>
    <p>
     And you use them like a file. Or the pointey end will get down in tight places.
    </p>
    <p>
     The holders are a couple dollars and the belts from 50 cents to a dollar.
    </p>
    <p>
     You get a lot of wear out of one because you just keep moving it around the holder.
    </p>
    <p>
     The purchased ones have belts in 5 grits from 120 on up, tho I can flit down to my local friendly and get coarser if need be.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then I made a big one 2" wide for flat stuff like the head gasket cover surfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's just a 2 piece with a screw and adjustment nut in the middle.
    </p>
    <p>
     Takes a standard 22" belt of whatever grit I like.
    </p>
    <p>
     I still have specialty files, jewelers, triangular, riffle, etc., but I just don't have much need for a flat file that lays around and rusts any more.
    </p>
    <p>
     Always sharp, first time rust gets to a good smooth cut file, it's dead.
    </p>
    <p>
     You might check them out, most machine supply houses will have them.
