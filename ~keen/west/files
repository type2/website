Subject: Files, metal, cutting, substitute

 One of the guys wanted me to do something on files.

  Not that kind, the kind that cut metal.  :-)

 I may, as I have some variety around here, but I thought I'd mention
a file substitute I use a lot. No it's not a rock. :-)

 It's called a "belt stick" or this big homker I made would have to
be called a belt board, or club.

 The small ones, up to 3/4" wide are bought and are a spring loaded
piece of plastic with a taper on one end and a round end on the other.

 They're 3/8 to 1/2" thick. 6,8 and 10 inches long.

 They are made to hold an abrasive belt, your choice of grit etc.

 And you use them like a file. Or the pointey end will get down in
tight places.

 The holders are a couple dollars and the belts from 50 cents to a dollar.

 You get a lot of wear out of one because you just keep moving it around the
holder.

 The purchased ones have belts in 5 grits from 120 on up, tho I can
flit down to my local friendly and get coarser if need be.

 Then I made a big one 2" wide for flat stuff like the head gasket cover
surfaces.

 It's just a 2 piece with a screw and adjustment nut in the middle.

 Takes a standard 22" belt of whatever grit I like.

 I still have specialty files, jewelers, triangular, riffle, etc., but
I just don't have much need for a flat file that lays around and rusts
any more.

 Always sharp, first time rust gets to a good smooth cut file, it's
dead.

 You might check them out, most machine supply houses will have them.
