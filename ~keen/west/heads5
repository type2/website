     I should probably get down on my knees saying hosannas (sp) and keep my mouth shut in humility. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     I rechecked the volume of my heads in preparation to go buy spacers tomorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
     The last time I did this, I had readings that went from 46cc to 49cc.
    </p>
    <p>
     This time I needed it real accurate so I was doing everything the same, right down to the pressure I used to hold the plastic disc flat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just a gentle pressure on the two flat sides while carefully injecting with no pressure in the middle.
    </p>
    <p>
     I also used a lighter grease and just enough to seal the valves.
    </p>
    <p>
     A real light film around the edge, just to stop the fluid.
    </p>
    <p>
     So I went thru the first two and they read same as last time at 49cc.
    </p>
    <p>
     I do the bad head and suddenly I have 49 again, not 46!
    </p>
    <p>
     I checked it two more times to be sure then went on to the last one and damned if it didn't come in the same! And rechecked it too.
    </p>
    <p>
     So I have 4 chambers within a quarter cc of each other.
    </p>
    <p>
     I like it! :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     What I had done the last time was got a little sloppy.
    </p>
    <p>
     I also used four valves and set up a whole head instead of the same two valves for all chambers.
    </p>
    <p>
     I also guess I used too much grease the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe some pressure on the center of that real low one.
    </p>
    <p>
     Three times apiece and everything identical.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yeah, I know Bob said that. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     There's a moral in there somewhere.
