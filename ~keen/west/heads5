Subject: CC'ing the Heads

 I should probably get down on my knees saying hosannas (sp) and
keep my mouth shut in humility.  :-)

 I rechecked the volume of my heads in preparation to go buy spacers tomorrow.

 The last time I did this, I had readings that went from 46cc to 49cc.

 This time I needed it real accurate so I was doing everything the
same, right down to the pressure I used to hold the plastic disc flat.

Just a gentle pressure on the two flat sides while carefully injecting
with no pressure in the middle.

 I also used a lighter grease and just enough to seal the valves.

 A real light film around the edge, just to stop the fluid.

 So I went thru the first two and they read same as last time at 49cc.

 I do the bad head and suddenly I have 49 again, not 46!

 I checked it two more times to be sure then went on to the last one
and damned if it didn't come in the same! And rechecked it too.

 So I have 4 chambers within a quarter cc of each other.

 I like it!   :-)

 What I had done the last time was got a little sloppy.

 I also used four valves and set up a whole head instead of the same
two valves for all chambers.

 I also guess I used too much grease the first time.

 Maybe some pressure on the center of that real low one.

 Three times apiece and everything identical.

 Yeah, I know Bob said that.   :-)

 There's a moral in there somewhere.
