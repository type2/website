     Cleaning the firesides . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     This one got started as a guy who was firing up a "Kommon Gear" that<br/>
     had sat for 8 years and actually had bent pushrods from the valves<br/>
     being frozen.<br/>
     Engine is totally full of carbon etc. but he can't pull the engine.
    </p>
    <p>
     Crudely put, he pried the valve stems loose and replaced the pushrods<br/>
     with a used set. Going the "many oil changes" route.
    </p>
    <p>
     Told him "Once you're squared away and have it up to running temp.and<br/>
     running well enough, pour a glass of warm water slowly down thru the<br/>
     carb, with the engine at medium high rpm.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Find some old man who knows how to do this. Like your dad."
    </p>
    <p>
     This will clean the combustion chambers and the fireside of the valves.<br/>
     Do it outdoors, you can blow a lot of crap out the tailpipe.  :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     And He Says:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Can't talk to my dad anymore, he's a lifelong alcoholic in total &amp;<br/>
     absolute denial, and may in fact be dead by now; I'll spare ya the rest of<br/>
     the painful details."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Can you go into more detail? should I be expecting the engine to stall out<br/>
     while doing this?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "is that procedure "safe enough" for an air cooled VW engine?<br/>
     (sounds like it might be an OK thing for WATER-cooled engines).<br/>
     does it have something to do with "thermal shock" or something?<br/>
     seems like it might be "adding insult to injury" by adding the<br/>
     potential for the rings to rust, or seize in their cylinders -dread-"
    </p>
    <p>
     So I Says:
    </p>
    <p>
     Water in your intake is not new to your car. There is water in the<br/>
     air. Water in the gas . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     Your oil actually absorbs water to keep it from accumulating in<br/>
     the bottom of the oil pan.
    </p>
    <p>
     Water cleaning does two things. It does cause thermal shock and it<br/>
     turns to steam violently and gives a good scrub inside the heads.
    </p>
    <p>
     I wouldn't be surprised to find it is the secret ingredient of the<br/>
     much touted "Techron".    :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     It will clean off the carbon deposits in the combustion chamber and<br/>
     hopefully also the valves and seats.
    </p>
    <p>
     What to do if you don't have a working Dad:   :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     Get the engine up to operating temp and get back in the engine room<br/>
     with a pop bottle full of water.<br/>
     Good clean tap water tho there are some who say Perriers is better. .
    </p>
    <p>
     a glass full, a can full, about 12 fluid ounces. 355 milliliters.
    </p>
    <p>
     I bet there's guys who've used beer for this.
    </p>
    <p>
     I like to use hot water but I doubt if it makes much difference.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pull the Air cleaner for access to the choke intake.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rev the engine up to around 3000 rpm and slowly pour the water into<br/>
     the carb. You are working the throttle with your other hand to keep<br/>
     the engine from stalling.
    </p>
    <p>
     You pour right into the center of the carb, steady your hand/elbow<br/>
     so you don't "dump".  You might practice this pour a couple times<br/>
     before you jump in there. . .  :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     When it starts to stall, you stop pouring and tweek the throttle a<br/>
     couple shots to clear it and then back to the water.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pouring and revving till you've used all the water and have scrubbed<br/>
     your little pistons/comb.chambers clean. Keep it just on the edge of<br/>
     stalling for maximum cleaning.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you stall it, it shouldn't be difficult to get started again.<br/>
     One rev will have blown the water out. If it's stalling too much, rev<br/>
     the engine at a higher rpm.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is one warning, if you just dump the water in the carb, you<br/>
     can get a solid slug of water in a chamber and blow a piston out.<br/>
     I can honestly say I have never seen this happen but it's a possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     After you've done your Firesides, now you do your compression check.<br/>
     You might even get a better reading than before.
    </p>
    <p>
     The cleaning will clean the plugs too but on a temp basis it can<br/>
     foul them with a big flake of carbon from a wall etc.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you check your plugs and it's fouled in this manner, I would think<br/>
     you didn't use enough water.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the oil, tho it is possible to get some water in your oil while<br/>
     doing this I doubt it on an average good running engine.
    </p>
    <p>
     That's about it dude 'n dudettes . . .   :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     Although it's a good procedure for "tuning up" a first time engine, it<br/>
     also is used regularly at least by me in my daily driver.
    </p>
    <p>
     About once a year is all, if I had a smoker or fouled plugs I would<br/>
     probably do it more often.
    </p>
    <p>
     Benifits: Jeez . .  a clean engine is a happy engine? . .  :-)<br/>
     It will allow max heat dissapation again. Seems to clean the valves<br/>
     and therefore gives better efficiency in mileage.<br/>
     May or may not clean the rings . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     I think it helps keep crap out of the oil in a round about way.
    </p>
    <p>
     If any of this seems like a bad idea, well don't do it. . . :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     Well what about Kerosine or Diesel Fuel instead of Water?<br/>
     Some people do do this . . . . :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     I don't know really, but I got a story
    </p>
    <p>
     This friend makes a living selling "Oil Treatments" for your car.<br/>
     One of the first things he does is take this can of stuff out and pour<br/>
     it down the carb like I do with the water. . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     On seeing black smoke pouring out your tailpipe he says "see, it's<br/>
     already getting the carbon out of your engine!!"
    </p>
    <p>
     The ingredients are "alcohol 'n an emulsifier 'n petroleum distillates"
    </p>
    <p>
     Put some on a piece of tin foil and put it over the stove flame.<br/>
     It just smokes black and leaves a grey powder residue.
    </p>
    <p>
     So what was coming out my tailpipe looked a hell of a lot like what<br/>
     he poured in my carb. . . . :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     I think Kerosine and Diesel fall in the same category but it's a<br/>
     personal opinion. . . . :-)
