     There's a saying in my world, where some guys nitpicking some job.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally the other guy or whatever will say "God, !! you're as bad as an old woman!!".
    </p>
    <p>
     I was playing both roles so we won't concern ourself with "political correctness".
    </p>
    <p>
     I was re-building a set of rather low-mileage rocker arms.
    </p>
    <p>
     I really do envy you guys who can grab a set of these and slosh them off in some solvent, wiggle them a bit and look them over and then slam them back in a car.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can't do that. I'm "worse than an old woman".
    </p>
    <p>
     I cleaned them in parts cleaner and then brought them in the house and put them in the sink and washed the assemblies in hot soapy water. Rinsed with hot and dried.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then I dis-assembled and layed the parts out in a neat little row and began to inspect them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took the shafts which showed very little wear as said, and turned them end for end and up-side down. Just to start a whole new wear sequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since I'd washed as an assembly, they were still somewhat grungy inside so the shafts went back to the soapy water and I scrubbed some more and polished with the scrotch-brite pad.
    </p>
    <p>
     Paper towels, probably the most expendable item in my house. I go thru a lot of them.
    </p>
    <p>
     All the other little bits are still dirty inside etc. so they all got another turn thru the sink and dried.
    </p>
    <p>
     Back in the neat little rows.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thought I'd put them all back the way they came off.
    </p>
    <p>
     I pick up the first rocker and inspect and deburr all the sharp edges and wipe it out, went over and got the assembly grease out of the fridge and opened it up and spread a dab on the part and a bit more on the shaft.
    </p>
    <p>
     Those greases and adhesives and sealers and hand cleaners keep better in the vegie fresher of the fridge. I also know right where they are.
    </p>
    <p>
      Re-installed on the shaft, found some burrs on the flat washers, stoned those off, re-washed to get the grit and dried.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then a bit of grease and slide'er on. The wavy washer showed a little wear but it's alright.
    </p>
    <p>
     Looked at all the wavy washers and a couple were bad.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bad is, they are getting close too a sharp edge there on the raised wave part.
    </p>
    <p>
     Made some calls to flaps. A buck apiece local or I can drive thirty miles and get them for half that. They're both a couple bandits.
    </p>
    <p>
     Told 'em so. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     I'm putting the last rocker on and wiping out the cavity where the pushrod goes, do a little stone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rockers, those casting looking things, are hard, hard, hard.
    </p>
    <p>
     I suddenly notice the little oil hole there and its mate inside the bearing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Didn't check if they were clean and clear. At least have to blow the water out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well crap! Take it all apart again and blow them all out, re-assemble.
    </p>
    <p>
     I'm doing these one at a time to keep from assembling backwards or some other equally logical dumb thing. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     Wiggle etc.. . I don't like the way they feel. Nag, nag nag
    </p>
    <p>
     The first one on the end even goes clunk on the stand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Take them clear apart again, "damned old woman!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Now I REALLY look at the wear patterns. It's not cool.
    </p>
    <p>
     Everything gets reversed, the ends go in the middle and middle goes on the end. Wear goes to non-wear and vice versa.
    </p>
    <p>
     Polishing and stoning, flattening the washers if concaved, reversing them too and polishing everthing with the "scotch-brite" pad.
    </p>
    <p>
     Look at the spring clips, turn them over or move them so the wear is on the the non-wear side.
    </p>
    <p>
     Re-assemble with grease and try the "feel" again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now I've got an assembly that's snug and as smooth as the action off a Mauser.
    </p>
    <p>
     Took about an hour each, but I have some "killer rocker arms". :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     I apologise if this was long and dreary, it is, it's also worth it.
    </p>
    <p>
     The parts anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still have to put the new adjusting screws and nuts on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have done my last "rounded off nut and wallowed out screw-head for adjusting tappets.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still have to be checked against the valve stems and shimmed if need.
