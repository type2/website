     I asked Dave if I could post this to the list. He was agreeable.

     Some of you may find it interesting. It was -12 degrees F when this happened.

      Wow... well, I realize I am a &lt;snip&gt; for driving after the light came on. But, but, it was only a little bit.... SMACK, from across the room, his conscience throws the Muir.
     </p>
     <p>
      looking for the hole? where it probably came out. Just so I get this right, there are several of these little plugs that could blow if the pressure relief valve isn't working? Also, should I just not drive her in that cold of weather? use different oil then 40 weight? Let it warm up longer?
     </p>
     <p>
      Oh yeah.. is there any reason that the little plug thing that I found on the road should smell like gas?

      I thank you for your time, Mr. West, and will no longer page down past your stories about the high seas. :) Just kidding... take it easy.

     First, where is the hole. The oil galleys run front to rear in several locations.
    </p>
    <p>
     Open the back of the van and get in there with a flashlight.
    </p>
    <p>
     You may need an inspection mirror too.
    </p>
    <p>
     I expect it's a back one because the front ones would likely be trapped in the bell-housing.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are at least three on the left, just recessed holes with a plug down in them. And I believe two on the right side.
    </p>
    <p>
     I suspect and sincerely hope it was a right side. Hopefully the one to the cam followers. The light would never have gone out if it were a left one.
    </p>
    <p>
     At least one of the left and rights are down behind the pulley.
    </p>
    <p>
     You know none of this is too relative since the only decent way to fix it is drop the engine. Might do in place if it's open tho.
    </p>
    <p>
     It smelled like gas because the rings let a certain amount run past them when you flood it and it just goes in the oil. Cold weather thing.
    </p>
    <p>
     You could have a leaky fuel pump too.
    </p>
    <p>
     Using 40 wt oil at -12 degrees F. is like using peanut butter.
    </p>
    <p>
     The pressure relief was probably working fine, it has to put some oil thru no matter how thick.
    </p>
    <p>
     Assuming you're in the lower 40 states, probably 10w-30 would be better. Go back to 40wt only in the hottest summer months.
    </p>
    <p>
     Longer warm-ups are also a necessary. Like 10 minutes or more.
    </p>
    <p>
     You don't want warm-ups etc. get a heater plate that goes on the oil cover and plug it in on cold nites.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you don't have your thermostat flaps operating get to work on it.
    </p>
    <p>
     In honesty, I've never even heard of one of those plugs popping out, so the blame is only partly yours, I would think.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the meantime, look at the bright side, you're about to get a cram course in v-dubbin that money can't buy. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     Hope you don't have to work in the driveway. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
     Would you mind my posting this to the list, that we may save others from a similar fate. Thus turning your defeat into an act of Nobility? :-)
