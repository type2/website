Subject: Valve guides & Stem seals

  Just a little one - I hope .

 Reading about a test on a  car where they removed the stem seals
on the exhaust valve stems.. . . Intakes left alone.

 The engine went from burning a quart every 2100 miles to 450 miles.

 Read another on a diesel engine that had such sloppy valve guides 
the engine kept running just burning the engine oil that ran down the
stems.

 How many of us even have stem seals? I had to coerce my Flaps into
even ordering me a set.

 How many of us are having trouble passing a smog test?

 These are what is referred to as "rhetorical" questions.

 You need not reply.

 Bob Hoover strikes again, one of the Sermons mentioned it.
  Just said "put 'em on".
