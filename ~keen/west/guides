     Just a little one - I hope .
    </p>
    <p>
     Reading about a test on a car where they removed the stem seals on the exhaust valve stems.. . . Intakes left alone.
    </p>
    <p>
     The engine went from burning a quart every 2100 miles to 450 miles.
    </p>
    <p>
     Read another on a diesel engine that had such sloppy valve guides the engine kept running just burning the engine oil that ran down the stems.

     How many of us even have stem seals? I had to coerce my Flaps into even ordering me a set.
    </p>
    <p>
     How many of us are having trouble passing a smog test?

     These are what is referred to as "rhetorical" questions.

     You need not reply.

     Bob Hoover strikes again, one of the Sermons mentioned it. Just said "put 'em on".
