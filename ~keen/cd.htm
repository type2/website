<p>If you've ever watched somebody at your local dealer look up parts on a
computer, you've seen this CD in action. This is the program/database that
provides all the part numbers, and exploded diagrams of everything in all of VW
cars. </p>
<p>The version that was provided to me is version ETKA 5.3. There is a newer cd
that I am aware of - EPC 5.5, and I'm keeping an eye out for a source of this cd.
For now though this cd is current up to the 2001 models, so its got a lot to
offer right now.</p>
<p><b>[CORRECTION: May 22/00] </b>The cd is actually the USA 5.5 data copied
over the 5.3 euro cd. This was to get around the fact that a crack for the dll's
on the euro cd was available, but none for the US cd. Somebody who has a 5.5 USA
ETKA cd, might want to try see cracked dl's work with the USA 5.5 CD. The dll's
are located in the 'epc_prog.w95' cd, and are LEXHDL5.DLL and LEXHDLL5.DLL.</p>
<p>You will need access to a burner, and a windows machine. It will install on
windows 3.1x machines, win9x, and NT machines. I think the installer installs
the win9x version for Win2K users. I cannot verify this since I don't have Win2K
installed here on any of my machines. I know however that it works under Win2K,
since the person who supplied me the CD runs it under Win2K. </p>
<p><b>[CORRECTION: May 22/00] </b>The cd install the NT 4.0 version on Win2K
machines. </p>
<p>Installing the program on a win9x machine is straightforward. You just
install it. On NT machines, you must install it, then go to the cd and into the
'EPC_PROG.W95' directory, and copy </p>
<p>LEXHDL5.DLL</p>
<p>LEXHDLL5.DLL</p>
<p>to your ' epc_prog' directory that is installed on your computer. </p>
<p>The ISO image of the CD was created with Adaptecs EasyCD software. I've had
several ppl confirm that they have downloaded it and successfully created a cd
from the image. If you are having problems. Either get a copy of this software
or try WinIMAGE ( see link below ), and extract the files from the .ISO file.
Once extracted, the files can be put on a CD, or installed from a temporary
directory. </p>

<p>If you have a traditional ftp program, even better is to do an anonymous
login ( login is: anonymous, and password can be any word ), and download the
file 'vwcd.zip'. Connect to the address of ' kozmik.guelph.on.ca '</p>

<p><b>The ftp server is limited to 6 people at a time. So if it tells you that
there are to many anonymous users, please try again later.</b></p>
