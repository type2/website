1. GETTING STARTED
  To get the calculator up and running untar the archive into the
  directory that holds your MRTG log files. The only configuration
  needed is in traffic.php, line 16, where you say what your logfiles are
  called. F.ex. <input type="checkbox" name="arrLogfileReal[]"
  value="SDSL;netopia.log">SDSL. Now just open traffic.php in your
  favorite browser and you are set to go.
  
  The traffic2.php is pretty much self explanatory. The only thing that
  might confuse you is why I load the values first into an array and then
  work my way from there. Well, MRTG adds values at the top of the file
  while php reads from top down. Since I have to multiply the average
  value of every period of time with the length of the period, this is
  the only way I saw fit.
