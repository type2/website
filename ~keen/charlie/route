Subject: My Route

Sorry but this post is a bit earlier than I prognosticated in my last post.
but so many ask about my route so I realized I should post it.

Let me say first that if anyone out there has enough disk space to save my
messages I would appreciate it.  I am trying to save my messages as sort of
another diary, but sometime I may forget, I need a backup.  I may put up a
post that says "I will work for disk space".  : )

My route should be generally as follows, although dates are somewhat
uncertain. I am planning on traveling as much of 97 as I can.

Hazlehurst Georgia (my home town, pop. 7000 est.)----Memphis (hopefully in
time for Elvis birthday, just think that would be
interesting.)-------Little Rock--------Oklahoma City (wanna see the bomb
site and pay my respects)----------Austin (got a little work
there)-------Questa NM (plan on staying there a few days)-------Arizona (as
much desert as possible)----------Grand Canyon-------Vegas (just to see the
lights at night)------------Southern California (gonna try to be a star if
I can be discovered within the time I am
there)-------------SF-------portland---------seattle--------vancouver--------

All of this is penciled in at this time, but you know how it is when your
searching for the beginning of wind, you never know what direction the
search will take you.

I do know the southern route is my only option for the winter start.

Thanks to all of you that replied so nicely to my message.  You guys are
great people, and don't any of you forget that.
