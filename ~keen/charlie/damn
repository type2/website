Folks I am getting wuite frustrated, all of a sudden I am having more
problems with the bus.  I wish I were a better mechanic when it comes to my
bus, but I am not.

I pull up to a redlight and it drops to low idle, then for no apparent
reason it just putts right on down and shuts off.  it runs fine on the
highway at reasonable speed, but seems to vary on idle speed.  first normal
then the idle fluctuates a couple of times then it shuts down.

Any suggestions from those of you that have the 2.0 litre fuel injected
busses.  I am about at my ropes end and honestly am in no shape to suffer
another breakdown.  many more frustrations and I may quit.

I have checked the points and had them checked by a mechanic, he set them
right but it continues to do it.  I checked the fuel filter, no problem,
all the vaccum hoses are solid, etc.

Thanks,
a very frustrated,
Charlie
