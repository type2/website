This morning at about 8:00 AM I recieved a call from a friend here in Saint
Louis whom Gus had been staying with, informing me that Gus had gotten hit
by a car.  He reported that while he was in the shower Gus had pushed open
the door and had apparently ran into traffic.

Gus was my traveling partner and buddy.  He was also known to many of you,
some in a good way, some in amost irritating way.  He could bark forever
and drop a load like no other dog I have ever had.

Most of all, Gus was a VW Bus Nut and he will be missed, most of all by me.  

Thanks,

Charlie Ford
