Dear person viewing this document,

I have been involved in community service since 1976.  My service career
started at a young age, and continues today with an even stronger passion
than ever before to ³Get things done².

Over the last 20 years, I have developed expertise in group dynamics,
management training/facilitation, and volunteer growth.  I bring with me
the skills of grassroots program development, knowledge of program
implementation, administration, and operations along with a strong working
knowledge of communities.

To me, the quality growth of National Service programming, along with other
service intitatives is imperative to creating positive lasting change in
America.

I have included my updated resume and my response to the qualification
questions listed in the announcement.  I look forward to hearing from you.
I can be reached anytime at (703) 684-7689, or via e-mail at
cford@sysnet.net.  Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Charlie Ford
