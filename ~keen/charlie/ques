I am heading toward New England in a few days and plan on visiting
Montreal, Quebec City, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia.  I am sure it will
take me a few weeks to do all of this.

While on this leg of the journey I would like to meet as many of you as I
can fit in.  Short detours are fine.  I will be working my way from
Cincinatti to Columbus to Cleveland to Buffalo to Montreal to Quebec City
and so forth.  Thus the following questions:

1.  Is there anyone on the first part of the route that I can have some
mail sent to and pick it up when I arrive in your area?  (it is a check
from the Colorado work I am doing right now and believe me I will need that
money as usual)

2.  How many folks are willing to lend me a level spot to crash for the night?

3.  What type weather am I likely to see?

Thanks,
Charlie

if anyone needs anything from this part of the country please let me know
and I can pick it up for you.  : )
