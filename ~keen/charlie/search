Subject: The "Search for the Beginning of Wind" Tour

I had the opportunity to meet a very special man last night... Charlie Ford
is the name he goes by and the "Search for the Beginning of Wind" tour is
what he is currently involved with. He has posted some highly enjoyable
(well, to most people anyways) stories about his adventures on the road in
his '79 CawCaw brown bus.

Myself and a friend met up with Charlie last night in the Fremont district
of Seattle at a bank parking lot where we discussed religion, the current
state of our youth, vw's, and his wonderous trip across the country. Well,
Charlie discussed and we just listened & anyone who's met Charlie will
understand ;)

After an exciting experience involving an ambulance, fire truck and a 95
year old man (i'm sure Charlie will explain this in his next post) we
headed to the Still Life cafe (the coolest place to dine & drink in north
Seattle!) for coffee, beer and more talk. Charlie has been involved with
AmeriCorps for many years now and is very passionate about the project and
has much information to provide anyone interested in this endevour.

After only a few hours in his prescence he left me with those warm fuzzy
feelings you get when confronted with a beautiful soul, feelings that will
last for a long time. Of course he also planted some seeds for adventure
and the possibility of my own trip. If he comes to your town please get
tickets because he puts on one hell of a show!
