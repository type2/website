Subject: The Search Ends [Charlie Ford's Last Post]


[I don't think it's *really* his last post, just the end of the Beginning
of the Wind. I'm told the correct return address for Charlie now is
<cford@altamaha.net>. --KH]

>This will complete the writings about my trip "The Search for the Beginning of
>Wind".  Now some of you out there are saying "It's about damn time".
>Others of you are saying, "Man, I'm gonna miss them there posts".
>
>To those of you that take the negative view, I apologize for wasting your time
>over this past year.  To those of you that take the positive and enjoyed the
>ramblings of this confused soul, thanks for taking the time to wander along
>with me.  I feel as if you were sitting with me in the passenger seat as I
>drove all of the miles.  It is you that the post were written for.  All of us
>want to travel, but few have the time or money or the will to take on such a
>journey.  I had no choice in the matter.
>
>Since the journey's end I have realized that "withdrawal from the road", is
>far
>worse than the "woes of the road" one might suffer.  I keep feeling like I
>need
>to go somewhere tomorrow.  I am so lost right now with so much indecision.
>Not
>too mention quite broke.  Starting over is tough.  I can't decide what to do
>with my life after such an expedition.  I am starting over from scratch.
>
>Since returning I am trying to write each day and have written a few essays
>about "home" and "being at home".  Hazlehurst is a special place that has a
>lot
>of small town flavor to write about, but I can't post these essays to the list
>because they don't have VW content.  I will instead post them to my website
>and
>if you want you can visit there and read them.
>
>Writing has become something of a passion for me.  Even I notice that I have
>improved since the beginning posts that were somewhat cold and without
>structure.  I have found a new hobby and that is just one of the products
>of my
>journey.  I hope I continue to improve, and maybe one day I will be
>published.
>That is every writers dream from what I hear.  It would be nice I must admit.
>
>If this year of "ramblings" ever do get published, and put into book form, it
>will be dedicated to this list, and all it's members.  Although, to be
>honest I
>cannot see how it ever could, publishers are pretty tough cookies to get the
>attention of.  I personally find it easy to write, but very difficult to read
>what I write.  If they pleased you then I am glad to be of service.
>
>The "Search for the Beginning of Wind" to me was nothing more than my personal
>search for a better life.  I had no expectations other than that of adventure
>and mystery.  I had no goals other than to finish.  I learned more in my
>travels than I ever have in any endeavor I have undertaken.
>
>This 'trip', this 'journey', is my most fulfilling experience to date and I
>doubt seriously that I will ever suffer anything this marvelous again.  I
>truly
>loved the travel and the people and it far exceeded any accomplishments I have
>made in my life.  The trip became as much 'yours' as 'mine', and I was glad
>too
>have all of you to share it with.
>
>In the beginning there was so much fear associated with the trip.  I knew
>nothing about the VW Bus, the Mothership, that had been given to me, but I
>knew
>I had committed to the trip itself when she was given to me by Zack Arias.  I
>knew nothing of the route I would take except that I would be south since it
>was winter.  Everything is a mystery in it's own way, like life itself.
>
>I needed so badly to succeed in something, and in that success learn more
>about
>how to succeed in all other endeavors I might attempt in the future.  I
>announced the trip not knowing all of the benefits it would produce.  To me it
>was standing out as something "crazy", and "not a sane man's actions".  An
>adventure of humongous proportions, the likes of Lewis and Clark only not as
>monumental or historic.  I faced my fears and headed out that fateful night of
>January 9, 1997 with $1200.00 in my wallet, and none in my bank account.  Just
>the way any adventure should begin, minimal and uncertain of fate.
>
>In essence what I did was retreat.  I did not run away or go "underground".  I
>don't deny the fact that I was in debt up to my eyebrows, and emotionally
>wrought with loneliness, and the fear that I would spend the rest of my life
>alone with no one to say "I love you" to.  I needed some relief from all the
>things that were ripping me apart.  My trip was my chance to take a step back
>and try to develop a plan that would essentially bring me joy in my life.
>Happiness is one thing, "joy" is something else when it comes to living.
>
>To me the title of the tour "The Search for the Beginning of Wind" sort of
>fits
>all of us at some point in our lives.  The wind is representative of life
>itself, here one moment and gone the next, sometimes strong, sometime weak,
>but
>still ever present.  If you put it specifically, you only have an average of
>about 75 years to be here with friends and family, to love and be loved, to
>leave legacy, and make a difference.  The wind blows, and then it stops as
>suddenly as it began.  My life had basically stopped moving forward.  A fellow
>may as well die if he is not progressing, I didn't want to die.
>
>Maybe in 150 years someone will stumble on my website, or an old discarded
>disk, and that generation will at least speak the name "Charlie Ford" once.
>Now mid you, they might stand there and say, who the hell was this guy?, and
>how the hell could he think he could write?",  but all I really want them to
>say is that it is evident that I tried to fulfill my dreams, and at least one
>of them was this journey.  In fact when I do die, I wouldn't mind having that
>as my epitaph "He Tried".
>
>When I was planning for the trip there was this great mystery for what lay
>ahead.  On the night I left my Mom's house the mystery heightened 1000%.  I
>drove along and cried because I had just left my Mother, maybe for the last
>time, and because I had kept my word to Zack who had given me the bus.  The
>first success was under my belt.
>
>A cold front had dropped down out of Canada and had dumped snow all over the
>southeast.  The winds were howling as I drove from Hazlehurst to Athens,
>Georgia.  They were hitting me directly in my spare tire cover that hung on
>the
>front of the Mothership.  I wondered if this was fate or nature.
>
>The first night I camped in a free campground with no power, it was 20
>degrees.  The wind was moving me back and forth with 40 mph gusts.  I
>questioned myself, my life, and my motives, and then fell in to a peaceful
>sleep.  I didn't dream, but I did roll and tumble.
>
>The next day I saw a couple of dear friends in Athens, Georgia, had lunch, and
>went on my way.  Birmingham came and went, Tupelo passed by my window, and the
>Mighty Mississippi rolled under the bridge as I crossed it in Memphis.  After
>that new territory lay ahead.  I had never driven this far before.
>
>Over the next few days the weather grew worse and the trip grew in miles.  My
>mind was stressed thinking about the road, the bus, and what I was leaving
>behind.  My job wasn't that good, but it was a job.  My bank roll wasn't that
>good, but I had one.  My love life sucked, but Atlanta was a great place to
>improve it.  So what the hell was I doing out here freezing my ass off in a
>vehicle surrounded by mystery?  Only God would enlighten me as the miles
>passed.
>
>I reckon I was looking to gain control by being "out of control".  I was
>searching for the answers I had searched for so long, in places I had never
>searched before.  I was trying to muster the courage to say "to hell with the
>future, I will just have to trust that it will be good".  I pushed forward
>with
>a fear that was so overwhelming at times it almost made me cry.
>
>I made my first big destination about 7 days into the trip.  Oklahoma City
>would be my first extended stop with a visit to a friend.  Cathy and I were of
>like mind to a certain extent, but in another way we were as different as
>night
>and day.  we had met in Miami a few weeks prior and we had set the meeting up
>then.  I stayed at her house for three nights.  The visit was good but not
>without some discontent.  The day I left was more a relief more than a
>dilemma.
>
>One last thing to do in Oklahoma City was to visit the Edwin Morrow Building,
>or at least where it once stood.  The cold had become colder and on the
>morning
>I visited the site it was 6 degrees.  The tears froze on my cheek as I walked
>along the barrier fence that surrounded the rubble that once was a government
>building and Daycare center.  I guess the thing that got to me the most was
>the
>lives of those lost on that fateful morn.  It was a sad site to see as I paid
>my respects to the dead and the living.
>
>My first problems with the Mothership came in Purcell, Oklahoma.  I had a fuel
>pump die on me and found myself in something of a dilemma.  I wrote the list
>and to my surprise there were many replies..  I found a pump at a NAPA store in
>Purcell and after some trials and tribulation made my way on down to Austin,
>Texas with a rougher running bus than I had started the trip with.  This
>pushed
>my fear and anxiety to new proportions.
>
>Depression, indecision, and all the woes that come with those two moods grew
>even stronger.  I almost decided to turn back and return home to the same lack
>of adventure I had left in the first place, no adventure, but more comfort.  I
>questioned my motives, my abilities, and my sanity.  One of which I still
>question even to this day.
>
>By the time I left Austin, Texas I had entered a new frame of mind.  I had
>thought about and decided not to turn back and had become happy with the
>decision.  West Texas improved my cache of patience and my bank roll.  New
>Mexico cooled my stress and eased my mind.  The land was solemn and filled
>with
>color.  The red desert, the brown tumble weeds, the snow capped southern
>Rockies.  I imagined cowboys and other wanderers riding through the area on
>horseback some 100 years ago as I drove along the lonesome highways that
>slowly
>climbed toward the Rockies.
>
>Along the way I saw an old friend or two, and an old cousin that lived in
>Winsloe, Arizona.  The old friend was glad too see me, the old cousin was a
>saddening site.  I moved on along with a more thoughtful mind about life and
>just what friendship means.  I thought about family, and how our elderly seem
>to get pushed aside as life's light grows a bit dimmer.  Sad but true.
>
>The Grand Canyon taught me about big and small.  Vegas told me I didn't
>need to
>gamble.  The desert is an awful place to be broke and deserted.  People line
>the streets asking for a nickel, only to use it for a game of chance.  At the
>Grand Canyon people from all over the world stood and looked at the
>spectacular
>view that only God could have created.  It took their breath and mine as we
>stood and gawked in awe.
>
>Finally I reached the Pacific.  Two months into my trip.  It was in Los
>Angeles
>area that I met a new friend and another cousin who I had never met.  Both of
>them brought to me a renewed confidence that I could make it all the way and
>attain the goal I had set out to attain.  Jack and Dobby are people of a fine
>nature, a nature that would be welcomed in my life.  I eased northward.
>
>California brought the graciousness, benevolence, and reverie of people.  Jack
>Stafford, Martha Rubin, Brad, Ron and the rest of the California Camping
>Crazies all played a part in creating a very pleasurable visit.  We had all
>gathered to see the Hale Bop Comet, but instead we saw each other and liked
>what we saw.  Narry a harsh word was spoken.
>
>We didnÌt' see the comet because of overcast weather, but we burned some
>magnesium and appeased the VW Gods with reverie and a large white glow.  A
>good
>time was had by all, as well as some great laughter and conversation.  Jack
>Stafford's homebrewed Oatmeal Stout made it even more festive.  I still have a
>bottle.
>
>The rest of the west coast all the way to Seattle taught me even more about
>those "special" articles of living, with Michael Lewis and Matt Zipeto
>bringing
>lessons that can only be learned by the experience of knowing these fine
>gentleman.  Mike welcomed into his family and Matt did the same.  They are
>nobility, if there has ever been nobility.
>
>I entered Canada for the first time in my life while on the "wet coast" as
>Tobin Copley put it.  I found the country to be clean and nice and full of
>folks of a gracious nature.  I found the hosiers of the "Great White North" to
>be people just like we are, although they do say "eh" a lot.  One day I
>will be
>back in Vancouver, and will cherish it until I re-arrive.  Tobin and Christa
>will be first on my list to visit.  I can't wait to see how much 10 Double M
>(their new babe) has grown.
>
>I left the west coast after two and one half months of basically living in
>Seattle.  While there, I had slept in a crime laden alley each night.  Each
>night I would lay down wondering what would be the excitement of the night
>ahead.  I finally got involved and calmed some of the ill and evil occurring
>each night and day before my eyes.  I can't stand it when adults involve
>children in their criminal activity, children just don't deserve it.
>
>Leaving Seattle was sad, but I was glad to see the lines passing in front
>of me
>once again.  I had to press on, the wind awaited me.  Doug at Doug's VW had
>made sure that the Mothership was ready for the road, and I felt confident
>as I
>drove along.  Doug is my VW Guru from here on.
>
>I eased through Eastern Washington and down the Columbia River Gorge toward
>Eastern Oregon.  It was there I met Jim Arnott and his family and we shared
>some good talk, and made a trade or two.  He is a great guy and a brother of
>like kind.
>
>Southern Idaho, the Oregon Trail, and Yellowstone taught me about the
>fragility
>of the environment and how man and beast can survive together and bring
>pleasure to one another in the co-habitation.  It is a marvelous place of
>wonder and adventure.  Life moves right before your eyes in the rivers,
>geysers, and streams.  It is a place that proves that the earth is a living
>being.
>
>Beartooth Pass in southern Montana, stood at 10,942 feet and taught me about
>the Nez Perce tribe and how we Americans hunted these people down and
>destroyed
>them all in the name of trying to ensure our freedom on this great continent.
>Chief Joseph and his tribe ran as fast and as far as they could and still died
>trying to escape the wrath of our armies.  Yes folks, even in a country as
>great as ours there are ghost to live with and try to reckon.  The Mothership
>moved up and down the grades with the greatest of ease.
>
>Wyoming taught me the meaning of solitude even while I thought of an old
>girlfriend that had walked in my dreams.  It was in that State that I traveled
>my loneliest road, thought of Judy (an old lover) in a blues filled state of
>mind, and met The Nipps.  The sun was hot and the people were plain and good.
>They reminded me that Gene Autry really was a cowboy, and that riding a horse
>is a pleasurable thing to do even when it's your daily job.
>
>Denver showed me that women are as indecisive about affection as men are, and
>that they can be as lonely as we.  Nebraska showed me that people need heroes
>and that the ones they choose have to live up to standards to great for the
>common man.  I didn't realize how many folks were reading what I was writing
>until that state rolled under my wheels.
>
>In Wisconsin I saw the north Mississippi river, Cheese producers, and
>beautiful
>countryside.  Highway 61 was visited, and thanks to Len and Jan Alcamo I saw
>that people can set aside one night a week to play music and enjoy each others
>company through that music.  In that State I also learned that writing is a
>craft, an art, that one can learn with enough practice.  I still have not
>practiced enough.  Thanks Bob, you increased the level of my dreaming.
>
>I eased on over to Chicago where I did some carpet laying and sweating.  That
>is undoubtedly the toughest job I have ever done.  After leaving there I drove
>through the potholes of Detroit and back into Canada for the second time in my
>life.  It was every bit as pleasurable as the first.  What a difference a
>border makes in the roads and scenery.  Canada has no litter, no potholes, and
>a lot of plain good folks.
>
>In Toronto I ran out of money and could not find enough work to move me on,
>although I did build a fence for Ron Mighton (he tells me it is still
>standing).  I retreated south to Cincinnati and into the company of Ted
>Finesman, Tony Moore and others to try and renew my cache of cash.  While
>there, I spent more time with VW's than any man really needs to.
>
>I love VW's and will always drive one, but dear God don't ever let me fall
>prey
>to the show-car mentality.  Too much ego and not enough driving.  I could have
>punched one guy in the nose if he would have bragged on his much more.  he was
>the biggest jerk I met on the trip.  In fact VW Trends recently featured his
>egotistic Ghia in an article.
>
>Saint Louis was a must.  Bill Bowman had corralled me at the Columbus, Ohio
>show and insisted that I make Busses by the Arch.  I said I would and off I
>went to the greatest VW gathering I had been to.  It wasn't a show, but a VW
>Campmeeting.  It was there I met Tom Neidernhoffer (gotcha), Pat Hoffman (the
>Guru), and Curt (the wanderer at heart).  These are folks I will no the
>rest of
>my life along with my brother Bill (the meticulous one).  I miss ya man, tell
>Kathryn (the garlic guru) I said hi.
>
>I drove southward to Illinois where I met my new traveling pal and confidant
>"Gus".  This Bassett Hound that is a free spirit no matter what the cost.  He
>will drop a load when the spirit freely moves him.  He will also wake you
>up in
>the dead of a cold winter night with a flatuation that will curl your
>eyebrows.  He is also a great co-pilot that has brought me company when no one
>else would or could.  Thanks Darrell and Jolene.
>
>In Southern Kentucky I taught AmeriCorps members how to serve better and they
>taught me how good young people can be when they put their idealistic
>energy to
>work toward good goals and objectives.  There is hope for our future.
>Kentucky
>READS program is a part of the solution.
>
>I returned to Cincinnati, and it was there I flew to Colorado to work with,
>and
>train even more college age kids that were a part of AmeriCorps.  They are
>serving the State of Colorado with a vigor like that of a 60's activist.  They
>are outspoken and full of energy and good karma.  I was fed once again the
>meat
>of giving to one another with an eye toward tomorrowÌs creation.
>
>In Cleveland, Ohio I got the chance to practice the patience I apparently had
>not learned crossing west Texas.  I sat and waited for a check to come from
>Colorado.  The Government sucks when it comes to paying you what they owe, but
>if you owe them, watch out.  Matthew, the person in charge of the money for
>the
>gig should encumber most of the blame.  Cleveland did bring me the new
>friendship of many, and for that I will always be thankful.  Hope things are
>good Neil, Lori, and the girls.
>
>I moved on into New England.  I visited Montpelier, VT, Bangor, Maine, and
>farther north into New Brunswick.  Grand Manan Island taught me that to dream
>is one thing, but to experience is quite another.  Especially when your dreams
>are in the hands of others.  I needed my dreams and experiences to myself.  I
>will go there again one day, I have too see the tide surge of the Bay of Fundy
>in my life.
>
>I headed south on highway #1 in Canada and realized suddenly that I was on the
>last leg of my trip.  So many times I had wondered if I would make it, and now
>there just wasn't that much more left.  Snow was once again falling and the
>weather that was once summer had become winter.  heading south brought some
>amount of sadness.
>
>Maine and New Hampshire brought new friends to call my own.  Ned Savoie, John
>Hathaway, and, Tom Goody being among the bunch.  Thanksgiving was filled with
>all the niceties of family, and friends shared by John.  Ned and I went skiing
>after the first big snow fall in the Maine Mountains.  Tom and I talked, and
>had a drink of whiskey.
>
>On reaching Washington, DC I seized the opportunity to renew some of my
>patriotic beliefs and to see some folks I needed to see.  I learned that one
>can remain quite popular even though they fall out of the mainstream.  I
>realized once again how many boys and girls have fought and died for this
>country to remain free.  I saw how our forefathers had dreams of something
>great even though they didn't know what it would all finally end up being.
>they did a good job I think.
>
>In Virginia I saw my Brother Lynn who is trying to figure out whether to stay
>with his wife of 20 years or to divorce and start all over.  I guess even the
>most sincere loves don't last forever.  Or at least the marriages that become
>the sign of that love.  I will stand by his decision no matter what it is.  He
>is my brother.
>
>I spent my Christmas alone on the Outer Banks of North Carolina.  On Christmas
>day I was invited to feast with the family of a guy I met at a gas station.
> It
>was a festive time to say the least.  They were the smokingest bunch of people
>I have ever had the privilege to meet.  It was nothing like Thanksgiving had
>been.  I really did enjoy myself.  that night I lay alone in my bus and read
>the biblical version of the Christmas Story.  It really is quite beautiful.
>
>I eased over to East Tennessee and spent some times with Doc Ric and all his
>offspring.  He gave Gus a checkup, me a shirt, and down to Georgia I went.  It
>took me all of week to get home and to be honest, it was quite nice to see a
>fire ant bed.  That was the first sign of Georgia I saw upon re-entry.  I met
>the three DavidÌs and James, and lamented at seeing my old stomping grounds
>for
>the first time since I had left them.
>
>I arrived back at my Mothers house on January 9, 1998.  One year to the day
>after setting out on my trip.  For some reason it had not been a trip at all.
>It was a journey that very few people get to experience.  The "coming home"
>was
>sweet and sour.  I wanted people to be proud, yet they were not so much.  I
>wanted recognition, but I got very little.  I guess there are still things
>that
>I need to work on, but they will come in time.
>
>In the past year I met so many people, some that will remain friends for
>life.
>I saw my country, one that I love with all my heart.  I drove lonesome roads,
>listened to distant radio stations, and got involved in creating positive
>change in a neighborhood 3000 miles from my hometown.  In this year I have
>loved, and lost, stressed, and relaxed and I am still here.  The only question
>that remains is what do I do now?
>
>Did I find the "Beginning of Wind"?  No, but I know now that it does exist,
>and
>that it can be found.  I just have to be patient, tenacious, and relentless in
>my endeavor to live life to it's fullest.  I have to commit myself to not
>accepting the way things are, and to have the boldness to meet the
>challenges I
>face, and others face.  It is my duty to serve, so serve I will, somehow, some
>way.
>
>Where is the beginning of wind?  I am not sure, but in as much as I have
>written in the past year it may just be that I am 'it's' beginning.  Pretty
>much the same as you are.  Maybe you and I are the ones that stir the tide,
>and
>move the sand up the shoreline to make dry land and whir through the trees to
>make the rustling sound.  Maybe we are the ones that power the young child's
>kite to fly higher and higher till it just becomes a dot on the blue sky.

>Maybe, just maybe my voice, my words, my ramblings, when mingled with your

>We have it in our power, but so few of us "seize the day".  If we all stop,

>
>Thanks for my contributing to my year.  The experience and all of you I will
