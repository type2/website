I saw a few busses on the road, if any of you were in them let me know;

green westy 70's model--------dallas, interstate 35, headed North.  good
hearty wave as we passed.

Orange transporter--------I 35 south, saturday i think, couple inside.
tried to flag them down to the station i was fueling at but they didn't see
me.

Biege westy, Austin, on or around 11th street downtown.
