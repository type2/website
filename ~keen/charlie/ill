---------------
	Charlie arrived here in rural Makanda, Illinois on Thursday and left us
this morning for a work shop/seminar in Kentucky. With Charlie around the
time just passed so quickly we were able to do only a few of the things I
had planned. Of course talking about our VWs and VW experiences could have
taken the whole time. Charlie took some time out to tune the Mothership and
check for any problems.I must say that she has a very nice VW sound to her
and I feel she is kept in much better shape than Charlie leads us to
believe.
	I think with a little help from fellow list members in Ohio,where Charlie
plans to be soon, we can convert him to a Midwesterner. After Wisconsin,
Missouri, and Illinois he has developed a pretty strong liking for the
taste for our bratwurst. We will need to find some way to disguise our
winter which lurks a short time ahead. 
	We really enjoyed being with Charlie and found him to be a quite
interesting person with a lot of goodness within this large Southern
person.Charlie, my wife Jolene and I say thanks for  spending a few days of
your tour here in Southern Illinois and we hope you are sucessful with your
quest to find the beginning of the wind.
