Subject: So which are you?

A friend sent me this note a little while ago after I stirred thing up on
the AmeriCorps listserv.  Sometimes, on that list, I tend to piss people
off more than entertain them.  It is amazing the power of this internet.
People can't see you so body language, or even smiles, play no role in the
post they read.


 Meet the Tate Family

 You may have heard of the Tate Family.  Members of this family
 attend every group.
   There is Dic Tate who wants to run everything.
   Ro Tate tries to change things --- whether they need it or not.
   Agi Tate stirs up trouble whenever possible.
   She gets a helping hand from her brother, Irri Tate.
   Devas Tate loves to interrupt whatever is happening.
   And Poten Tate wants to be the big shot.
   When new ideas are suggested, Hesi Tate and Vegi Tate are quick
      to say why they will not possibly work.
   Imi Tate would rather copy others than try something new.
   Thank goodness the Tate family also has Facili Tate, Cogi Tate
      and Medi Tate.  They are willing to pray, think, and plan.
   They get everyone pulling together.
           Which member of the Tate family are you?
