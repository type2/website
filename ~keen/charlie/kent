Subject: The Quiet Kentucky Run

Today I find myself a little melancholy, a little disappointed, and a
little anxious.  The road once again lay before me and the excitement of
even a couple days travel brings an edge of apprehension and anticipation.

There truly is something pure about traveling in our vehicle of choice.
Simply put, it breeds patience, and one can never have enough of that.
Right now, I need solitude.  Last year I learned that the road and the
Mothership can generate just that.  I guess this is sort of a continuance.

My thanks to Steve Dolan for his hospitality and assistance.  He welcomed
me into his home, spotted me a stake, and tolerated my single assed set in
my ways crap for a couple months.  There ain't many that could do that.  :
)  But then Steve ain't sane either...... guess it goes with VW ownership
and middle age.  I'll be in touch soon man.

Chris Chubb, my brake man ....my friend.  Thanks Chris and Theresa for your
assistance and relief.  I will talk to you soon.  Check out Tuscon for me.

I am scheduled to arrive in Kentucky on Saturday.  The route I plan on
taking is still up in the air.  Steve, Chris, and I sat down last night and
discussed and debated many issues incuding the route I should take.  It's
truly amazing the shoot the bull dynamics three people can generate when
each of them are thinkers in their own world and perspective.

They filled me in on the ills, evils, and inclines of the routes I was
considering.  Prior to that we talked about gun control, and that
conversational canoe flowed into class five adventerous opinionated dribble
that eventually dropped us into the pool of realization that we each had
our own correct set of points and would not budge from them, hey...... at
least we had the audacity to discuss it.  Conversation..... a dying art I'm
afraid.

Anyway............Me, Gus, and the Mothership are on the road.  Three days
to travel 700 miles give or take, acoording to which route I choose when I
get to the crossroads.  Needless to say, I will be taking my time, but then
that is the rule.

I will be traveling south by southwest around the states of Virginia, West
Virginia, Tennessee and Kentucky.  Along the Appalachains, should be good
scenery and good road.  I look forward to it.

The "Search" continues.......................................

Thanks for tolerating the rambling's,

Charlie Ford
