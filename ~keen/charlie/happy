Subject: happy day!

At the prompting of one of the many replies I checked the battery cable.
Sure enough it was loose so I tightned her up.  So far all is better, and
it is idling fine so far today.

makes a man feel like and idiot, but a happy one.  but then so do a few
women I have known.  Maybe that is why tyhe  busses name is "The
Mothership".  ; )
