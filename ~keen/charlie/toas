Subject: On to Toas

Tomorrow i am going to a shop, get my bus fixed and I am on to Toas.  I
will be skipping Big Bend for now, but in all honesty it wasn't on my
original itenerary anyway.

Thanks for all the post in reference to my problem, all were of great help
and at least I will know what the hell the guy is talking about when he or
she finds the problem.

After she is fixed i'm headed west.

Will post again soon, and as much as I am sure you guys hate to hear this,
it may be again about problems.  : )

hey, ya'll are the biggest bunch of tinkerers I know.  : )
