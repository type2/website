Subject: Giving and Thanks

I read the post the other day on the guy that had his bus broken into.  Now
I am not sure I would even be so patient with someone breaking into my bus,
but a good point was raised.

Someone chimed in and said something like, give your stuff to organizations
so it can dispersed to the needy with some control.  I think folks should
go out and involve themselves by volunteering.  Give of yourself, that is
the key to getting things done.

This Thanksgiving I have so much to be thankful for.  I am jobless, and
relatively speaking, 'broke' financially speaking, and happier than I have
ever been in my life.  

In this year my life has taken an amazing turn, in that it has been
enriched by all of you.  Each and everyone of you (yes even the PNW person
that hates my conservative thoughts) have contributed to my knowlege, my
well being, my diet, my safety, my adventure, and my Bus.  For that I give
thanks.

God has kept me safe and allowed The Mothership to transport me close to
20,000 miles right now. So far without incident. 

Thanks to all of you.  I just can't say that enough.  

You are all in my thoughts and prayers this Thanksgiving.

Once again, 'Thanks for tolerating the ramblings'.

Charlie Ford
