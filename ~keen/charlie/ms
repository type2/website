Subject: Merry Christmas everyone

For the next few days I will be out of pocket so I wanted to wish everyone
a Merry Christmas, Happy Hannukah, and Happy New Year.  Life would not have
been as pleasurable for me this year if all of you had not been around.

If I had the money nto buy a gift for each of you I would do it in a
heartbeat.  I am honored to be a part of your community.

Thanks for tolerating the ramblings.
