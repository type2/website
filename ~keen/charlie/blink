Subject: Mothership Blinker Problem

Before and after the "Dove" episode, I tried to take care of some bad wires
on my battery side tail light today.  I spliced in some new wires, but
somehow screwed up my blinker on that side.  Electrical is out of my league
along with a few other things.

Now prior to doing this work my blinker was working fine, but the wires
looked really bad and I figure a gas leak would pretty much tick me in the
top of a tree if it got mixed with a spark created by the faulty wiring.
The Mother is not supposed to fly.

After I finished these were the symptoms:

On the drivers side the blinker is the amber lens,
on the battery side the blinker is the middle red lens (which lens is
correct?),
and it doesn't blink.

When flipped to that side the blinker lite on the dash blinks real fast
(Double time).

Any answers????

Any suggestions other than the obvious of checking my bulbs, fuses, etc.

Sorry if the "Dove" post offended anyone, but I am one that believes that
being a motorhead is not the only angle from which one can discuss type
2's.  Any discussion you feel enticed to offer can occur via P Mail to me.
To review my VW Credentials please refer to my webpage and figure it out
for yourself.  I look forward to hearing from you.
