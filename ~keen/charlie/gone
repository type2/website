Too many of you that is a great relief, and personally I cannot blame you
one bit.  I know that over the past few days i have sort of deluged the
list with messages that had very little to do with VW.  But they did have a
lot to do with the History of the VW.

I only wish we would have had listservs in the 60's and so some flower
child could have posted some reference material on doing America.  Of
course back then nobody really cared much about anything but the next
buzz........Hmmmmmm.  : )

I think I am ready, The Mothership (that beautiful 79 bus) is packed with
everything I will need for my trip, including, as mentioned in an earlier
post, some tradables in case I need them.

My Mother made me some homemade biscuits for the road.  She packed me some
good Raspberry/fig perserves for regularity :).  She also made sure I had
clean underwear and my first aid kit was in order.  I have clothes,
campgear, water coolers, cb radio, tools, and a bed.  What more could a
person ask for?

Life is good!

This will be my last post for a while.  I will be hooking up where I can on
the road to drop you folks a line.  And the volks that have invited me to
drop in for whatever reason, I will mail or call as I get near your area.
I look forward to meeting all of you if possible.

Thanks to all of you for the support, and letters of encouragement.  You
guys have been a great help.

Please do not reply to this message unless absolutely necessary.  Thanks.

Thanks,
Charlie
