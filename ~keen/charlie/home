I made it folks.  365 days, 22, 847 miles exactly.  The Mothership did an
amazing job with very few problems to speak of.   She is a great bus!  I am
proud to own her.

I arrived home about 30 minutes ago.  My Ma was happy to see me and the old
home place still looks the same.  Things don't change much in Hazlehurst,
Georgia.

I will have to admit that I am at a loss as to what I am going to do now.
I have no where to go, no where to be, and the trip, the "Search for the
Beginning of Wind" is over.

I will write my summation over the next few days.

Thanks for tolerating the ramblings.
