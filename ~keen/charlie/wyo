Subject: Charlie Ford leaving Wyoming

Charlie Ford arrived around seven last night after driving what he said
"was one of the loneliest roads he had been on," the road he was
referring to is Hwy 20 between Shoshoni and Casper (you have been
warned). ;)

Didn't know what to expect, but am happy I invited him, reminded me of
some of my relatives down south, very nice guy.    :D

Anyway he left this morning after tinkering with his starter, may need
some help on that down the road. So keep a lookout for the "Mothership"
he was enroute to Denver and then I think he was off to University of
Kansas and continueing East.
