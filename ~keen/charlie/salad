>Are we still as serious about the bi-partisanship as we were in the
>beginning, or are we letting service be polluted by political party agenda?
>
>Bill Clinton didn't invent this service movement, niether did George Bush.
>It happened because the American people started getting interested in
>finding solutions and asked government to help them implement some of the
>ideas that came up.
>
>The fact is that many of the people that started this thing were people of
>vast experience in the Peace Corps, Vista, and other grassroots
>organizations.  They were folks that came from very diverse backgrounds.
>They were not all young and most had never worked for a political party of
>sny sort, they had only done service where service was needed.  They were
>christian conservatives and liberals, they were of all races, genders,
>colors, creeds, national origins, and sexual preferences.
>
>Right now we all complain about the republicans or the democrats, according
>to which party we claim to be a part of.  The most liberal are always
>talking about the ruthless rhetoric of the conservatives and the most
>conservative are doing the same on the other side.  For once I would love
>to see people just dedicated to serving without the influence of politics.
>I would love to see someone stand up and say that they respect Newt for
>what he does as much they respect Bill for what he does.  Both of these
>folks represent the American citizenry, even though sometime we have to
>question the motive and tactics they use in that representation.  In my
>opinion government representatives on both sides have abused their
>positions equally and without regard to the whole voice of the American
>public.
>
>In my opinion in order to be a true "servant" you have to be dedicated to
>the service, not the funding, and certainly not the party.  You have to
>give whether you have funding to give or not.  It is about one's philosphy
>of living with others, and "being part of the solution, rather than part of
>the problem".   Service does not grow from money, it grows from someplace
>in one's heart.  The passion is developed through an observance and
>recognition of need.  I have always said that it is something spiritual
>that dwells in the soul of an individual.
>
>I am and have always been a very opinionated person and now I find myself
>questioning whether the entity we have built over the past few years really
>represents and promotes this holistic spirit of service. These are concerns
>that I have, and have heard voiced from programs scattered around the
>country.  There appears to be a major gap between the people and the
>government.
>
>The political struggles of this past year should have taught us that each
>party has a strong role as to whether we survive or not.  Many of the
>politicians on both sides are watching us to see what model we build, and
>whether AmeriCorps represents "all the people, by the people, for the
>people".  It seems to me that in many ways we are leaning toward
>representing one "political party, by the party, for the party".  It
>appears as if we are nowthinking more of the present administrations
>political agenda rather than the alleviation of problems involved in the
>issue areas we address.
>
>The problems in America will not go away because one party or the other
>holds the presidential office, or controls congress.  They will only go
>away when we as citizens start to respect the fact that everyone has to
>live here and then we strive to make a difference together.  The building
>of involvment is the issue we face, not who takes office in the next
>election.  I somtimes wonder if DC is working with this in mind.
>
>I would like to propose a scenario:  What if in the next election the
>Republicans took office, would we be a program that would fit well with
>their agenda.  Most of the common people around the country that I know are
>Republicans believe that AmeriCorps is worthy of funding.
>
>Everyday I see us growing further apart rather than closer together.  We so
>often base this separation on religious beliefs, political beliefs, sexual
>preferences, or color of our skin.  Let the politicians be separate, but
>let us, the citizens of our country be together for the common good.  We
>have to set the standards for them to live by.  And we hold in ourselves
>the power to make the difference that will count.
>
>Believe whatever you want politically, but be of service to any you come in
>contact with.  Join with others as often as possible for the cause of
>serving whoever needs service.  Cross the lines that all of us have helped
>draw, and come together with those different from yourself or your beliefs.
>Let's build the model we seek to build, and let it represent all the
>people, by the people, for the people".

>In my travels I have seen America, and it is african, european, hispanic,
>asian, and indian.  It is poor, and rich, and middle class.  It is
>republican, democrat, and independent.  It is male and female, homesexual,
>bi-sexual, and heterosexual.  It is old, middle aged, young and infant.  It
>is religious and non-religious, christian, muslim, buddhist, and catholic.
>It is constantly changing and growing and we as "people in service to
>people" have to make sure that all are respected and cared for.  That is
>the mission we set out to accomplish.
>
>I am christian and conservative and believe that to serve is the greatest
>thing one can do in one's life.  I beg you to come together and lets build
>our bi-partisan model, and the politicians will have no choice but to
>follow suit.
>
>Sorry, I just felt like rambling about the appreciation of diversity.  I am
>also working on my VW today, so just in case any of you question what I do
>other than write, you will know.  hey, enquiring minds want to know.  In
>between spark plugs this is what I have been thinking about.  : )
