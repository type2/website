>One more time.  I am swallowing my pride.

>Hi my name is Charlie (bubba) Ford, I am traveling around the country in
my VW bus, and I am in need of some feeding.  I love to gorge myself on
steak potatoes and service (no offense intended to the vegie folks out there).
>
>I am country and quite simple in mind.  I have traveled from Georgia to
Seattle in 6 months.  Time is not a factor for me this year.  I am
celebrating turning 40.
>
>I have to warn you, I may post an essay every now and then.  And you may
disagree with its relavance,and the passion I clearly try to portray in my
writing.  If you don't want to read it, delete it, if you do read it and
disagree with it........ discuss it!  Justify your discussion and let me
know why you don't agree with it.  Then I can grow from your experience,
and you maybe can grow from mine.

>Here is my first post.  This was a facilitated session I did with my
members the first year I was involved with National Service, 1993.  They
had a goods time with it, maybe this list can too.  Be as trivial or as
large in the items you post as you want.  maybe we will all be able to have
something to paste to the wall of our office.  I will paste it to the
window of my bus, The Mothership (long story).

>Subject:  Basic Service
>
>For the entire day I have been thinking about people, and how they serve
>each other in their daily lives.  Of course there are many different
>degrees that people take this worthwhile "right" thing to do.  In this
>essay I just want to talk about basic giving in our everyday lives.  Things
>we sometimes don't even think about, and things we may need to think more
about.
>
>I am one that believes that there is no such thing as "common service".
>Service is like a savings account, the more you put in, the more benefit
>you draw.  The more service you do, the better your kharma is for the
>future.  The good you do is not lost, although sometimes the ungrateful
>people make us think it is.  
>
>How many times have we had our day brightened by someone letting us have a
>parking spot that they also had an opportunity to occupy?  How many times
>have we dropped something only to have some stranger reach down and pick it
>up, or even help us carry the article to our car if our arms were already
full.
>These are all benefits reeped from our "good deeds done".
>
>The fact is that people these days are "service impaired".  We are so
inundated with pride, or fear, or ism's that we don't consider the basics
of building up our account.  Just think if we took care of the simple then
it makes it easier for us to take care of the large things of service we do.
>
>In AmeriCorps, we have to promote not only the biggy issues of change, but
also the minuet issues of change.  The basic every day things people do to
be of service.  
>
>The people that call themselves "servants" have to make
>it their lifestyle, something that is just as much a part of their being
as an
>arm, or a leg, or a brain.  The service we perform as "people of service"
has to be
>performed without regard to any discriminating factors at all.  We have to
serve
>everyone, every day and night, 7 days a week, and 365 days a year, with or
>without pay.  We may not be where we can, but we must always be at the
>ready call in case our service is needed.  In doing this, we as AmeriCorps
reps start setting a visible working model of what we ant people and our
society to become.  We are not only teaching the concept but we are
modeling the concept in very basic and simple ways.

>In thinking about this matter I started listing in my mind the most basic
>things people can do to be of service to others.  I started listing this in
>an effort to improve myself, thereby improving the quality of life for
>those around me.  If I do more service, even little things of service, then
>I am promoting the concept more.  I am building myself up, and the ones I
>help are also having an example of lifestyle set for them.  We all come out
>in the good in the end.

>The list is not broken down into categories so you might see anything that
>pertains to anything.  It might be something you can even use as a
facilitated session on your next training day.
