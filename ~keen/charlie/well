Employment in the field of my choice (AmeriCorps) has eluded me to the
point of sincere depression.  In lieu of this, at the end of this week I
will be leaving the DC area and heading down to Franklin, Kentucky to work
a three week contract with Kentucky READS, an organization dedicated to
reducing illiteracy in that State.

Steve Dolan has been a gracious host and very good friend. He has gone
above and beyond the call to help me keep my head above water.  If anyone
ever has doubts concerning this man's good nature you will have me to
reckon with, and I will drive to where you are for that reckoning.

I will be leaving here probably Thursday afternoon arriving there hopefully
on Saturday.  The job is not much, but at least it's something.  The
Mothership seems to running great but you guys know how decieving that can
be when your traveling.

If the list member in Oregon that wrote me recently telling me of a job in
Portland would get back in touch I would appreciate it.  I plan on heading
to the PNW after this job and would like to secure a job of some sort
before I head that way.  I have to do this job first in order to raise some
traveling money.

Also, for those of you that are interested, the writings are still in
editing and it does look as if we will be submitting it to a publisher for
consideration of a book.  Drop me a line if you are interested in a copy.

I am a little down right now because of all the events of the past few days
so if any of you pray, say one for me.  : )

Thanks for tolerating the ramblings,

Charlie Ford

PS:  I will be seeing you soon Ken.  Franklin is not that far from Memphis.
