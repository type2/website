COMMENTS:<br>
I have traveled extensively throughout America in a VW bus and have had many people help
me out BIG time. (God bless you Todd and Steph) If you are near by, just give a call. I'm
not master mechanic, but have been known to do a block swap in a driveway in 3 days. I
sold my bus and bought a &quot;real&quot; van. Don't take that personally but I'd never
trade my V-8 and a/c. <br>

tools though. The garage is currently occupied by the kombi resto but, there is
several spaces on blacktop for any repairs. As long as were at home, my wife and
I would be glad to be of assistance. As we're planning a lengthy roadtrip
ourselves, we also wouldn't mind hearing your road-tales. We will only be around

COMMENTS: I was driving today and I saw a VW on the side of the road.&nbsp; I
remember using AIRS to help me out when I was traveling across the country for a
year in my 78 VW camper Bus.&nbsp; One guy helped me get parts and another guy
let me use his storage unit so I could take out my motor and replace my clutch
and &quot;throw-out bearing.&quot;&nbsp; I would like to offer my services to
meet new people, learn more about vw's and to help others (&quot;pay it
forward&quot;). Feel free to call me at anytime.<br>
