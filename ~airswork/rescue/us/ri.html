VW'S: 66' Bug Sedan<br>
COMMENTS: Full-time college student, so my 66' Beetle is kind of a side hobby
right now.&nbsp; I've had my Bug for 3 yrs now.&nbsp; I'm no VW expert, but I'm
learning and will try to help with anything I possibly can, even if it's just a
ride.&nbsp; I have basic tools with limited workspace inside, but I do have
enough lawn space for Bug or Bus work, if needed (it's my grandparent's house,
so I have to work out stuff with them before being able to do anything in the
back lawn...also explains why I cant offer camping space/spare room...sorry).&nbsp;
Not too many connections as I do most of my work myself.&nbsp; Also, looking for
a VW (or any classic car) group to go to car shows with (taking my Bug, of
course) come summertime!!&nbsp; Hope I can help with anything you might need!!<br>
P.S.&nbsp; I do have some Geo Metro experience and knowledge, in case there are
any Metro/Bug owners out there like me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
AVAILABLE: Weekday evenings (have class at URI until about 5 everyday), weekends
anytime.&nbsp; Summertime, dont know what my work schedule will be like...just
call and ask for Rob.<br>

COMMENTS: Call anytime- Just be clear about information- we're happy to help as
long as we have the right info- local parts and other resources available. I am
a self-employed carpenter who is home more often than not- I have owned VWs in
my youth and my son just got his first. Most of the time I am around and happy
to help, but if you catch me at a busy time I may be unable to be present but
you are free to use what resources you can. Just call ahead, be clear about your
needs and I'm sure we'll get you on your way as soon as possible. It's not an
option, but my favorite beer is Sierra Nevada, by the way!<br>
