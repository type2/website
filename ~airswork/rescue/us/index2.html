<p>This AIRS contact page is retired.</p>
<p>The volunteer contact list behind AIRS has not worked for years, so we are leaving these pages online only as an archive instead of pointing you at disconnected phone numbers. AIRS had a good run from 1999 through the mid 2010s, but it is not coming back in its old form.</p>
<p>If you are stuck, need advice, or want to help someone else, the Type2 mailing list is still where the community gathers:<br>
<a href="https://www.type2.com/lists/type2/main/">https://www.type2.com/lists/type2/main/</a></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Thank you to everyone who kept AIRS going for so long.</p>
