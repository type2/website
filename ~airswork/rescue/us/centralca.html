COMMENTS: After more than 10 years away from air-cooled VWs, I decided to pick

VW'S: 1971 Pop-Top Campmobile<br>
COMMENTS: I'm fairly novice, on my first VW. But I just finished puting together
and installing an engine on a rebuilt bloc (August 2003). So, I'm more yellow
than green at working on this particular engine.<br>
<br>
I have some decent tools. My driveway is steep and short, but usable for some
things. My garage is a VERY tight fit for campers, and usually only accomplished
by deflating the tires slightly.<br>
<br>
Also, I have a housemate who is very sweet and very knowledgable on this engine
now, too; we both have blood in my vehicle. But I need to be considerate of the
fact that she lives here, too, even if it is my house. Moderate alcohol use is
fine, but no dope. Smoking is fine outside on the porch.<br>
<br>
Be forewarned that I have several indoor cats. If you are allergic or are not
cat-friendly, don't come inside. I keep my place reasonably tidy, but you'll get
shed fur on you, guaranteed.<br>
<br>
Beer is a fine bribe for me. I like it dark, typically, but nothing is better
for working on engines than Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. Goes well with engine
grease. The hotter it is outside, the lighter I like my beer. Room temp is fine.

COMMENTS: Have Standard/Ghia and Super Beetle Tow bars.&nbsp; I also have a
truck capable of towing them as long as you're not a ground-scraping lowrider.<br>

I have most specialty VW tools (flywheel lock, 17mm allen, big sockets, breaker

I am willing to sell any needed tools and common spare parts
(belts/hose/coil/distributor/plugs, etc. to you at a fair, low price and
replenish my collection myself instead of loaning them out.<br>
I had a '55 Bug for several years.&nbsp; I have personally hand-built two
engines and assisted with a third.&nbsp; Two 1641s and a 1914.<br>
I work full time as a low-voltage electrician, so I have those tools, too.&nbsp;
Those tools stay with me.<br>
My cell is on 24/7 but don't call at unearthly hours unless it's an emergency.<br>
IF YOU HAVE A SUPER AND NEED TO BE TOWED, YOU WILL NEED TO ALREADY HAVE THE
BOLT-ON ADAPTER PLATE UNDER YOUR SWAY BAR OR I CAN'T TOW YOU.&nbsp; I am not
torching off the one I have.&nbsp; Sorry.<br>

we are very VW friendly and I have a few REALLY good resources to call on for
help and a great VW shop nearby. We have a great selection of tools, including a
plasma cutter and several welders. Always looking for new friends in the VW

night and nobody bother you if need be.&quot; Am right off the freeway and have
a pretty decent assortment of &quot;quick&quot; tools if you need 'em and
assistance. Can lend an ear, a hand, my car wrenchin' knowledge and a beer if
yer' car' got you all frazzled. I'm about 6 miles north of Gilroy, CA.
