VW'S: 1974 VW Camper van<br>
COMMENTS: I do travel quite a bit (by road always) and recently purchased my
first air cooled vehicle. I grew up in a VW bus and have always wanted one. The
opportunity finally arose and I jumped on it. It is a full camper conversion in
spectacular condition. I live out in the rural district with plenty of room for
babies, pets, vehicles. There are a few dogs and cats around so your animals
should be good with others.<br>
AVAILABLE: whenever, call if i don't answer leave a message and ill return it
very shortly.<br>
