VW'S: 1956 Beetle, 1964 Standard Microbus.<br>
COMMENTS: ACVW fan since 1972 when I got first Beetle. Have owned<br>
a few Beetles, a '66 Bus and '72 411. Experience with minor repairs, common
problems for these engines. Have rebuilt a few, but I'm no expert. Have tools (natch),
garage and driveway space. Familiar with cold weather ACVW problems, tune-ups
and repairs while lying on the snowy ground with a 30mph draft from Alberta
moving through, but I prefer not to do it that way. Bring yer own parts unless
you can wait for overnight mail, because no one in the area has any new. Few
ACVW in local junkyards anymore. No payment ever accepted, but if you want to
take one of the kids' cats when you leave, that will be thanks enough.<br>
