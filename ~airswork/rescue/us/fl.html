COMMENTS: I'm an older guy so I don't move around like I used to but I have 15+
years working as a mechanic&nbsp; most of that on VW's of one form or another,
so I can help and advise with just about any repair. I'm pretty good with
electrical and FI. There is a VW shop just across the street from me and
surprisingly, the Advance Auto Parts store nearby can get a lot of VW parts
within a few days including FI parts.<br>
<br>
I really hate having to add this but past experiences make it necessary.<br>
<br>
I am NOT on this list to help make up for YEARS of neglect/ abuse or
questionable repairs to your vehicle, I do NOT wish to play host to those simply
looking for a cheap place to crash for DAYS ON END.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Now all of that being said...If you've included Key West in your travel plans,
are a respectful guest or are in need of assistance to get you back on the road,
please feel free to contact me, I am happy to help any way I can.&nbsp; I'm a
night owl so don't worry too much about calling late. I can be contacted on my
cell most any time.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah...my &quot;spare room&quot; is the couch.<br>

PA. I'm always up for meeting, helping out, and spending time with folks who are
like in mind and spirit. I'm one of the kindest and most generous hippies you'll
find in these parts, but have burned enough to know when I'm being taken unfair
advantage of (remember: Karma's a bitch!) I'm NOT A MECHANIC, but will freely
give of my time, labor, and resources to help keep you chuggin' down the road
and will provide emergency transportation if you need it. Summertime usually
finds me on the festival circuit, but feel free to call and find out what I'm up
to!<br>
