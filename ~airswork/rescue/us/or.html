COMMENTS: I honestly love my bus, but don't really know how to work on it.
THANKFULLY, I have a trustworthy mechanic about a mile away who is open 6 days a
week. If I break down on a Sunday, I can usually find some way to get help until
I can find my mechanic. I would highly recommend both AIRCOOLED shops in
Corvallis: &quot;Independent Auto Werks&quot; and &quot;Little Germany&quot;.<br>
I can talk troubles and travel, but can't give much advice.<br>
