I'm an artmag editing performance poet who mechanics for hire/trade by request only &#151;
I do not solicit others. I'm located in a quonset hut on a backroad and if necessary you
could go so far as to rebuild here. I've got good connections in Seattle as far as
machining and parts go, plus some spares here for later T2's and a '65T1/1200 parted out.
I don't do freeloaders and my tools don't leave the shop without me, ever. If you're
really flat I'll help but won't do the work for you unless you pay me. I work on my rigs
because I got tired of being ripped off by shops who either hate VW's or old hippies who
smoke pot while they work on your car. There's great telephone tech support locally, and
of course I could provide access to internet tech such as this. Don't be shy to call or
write if you need help &#151; I'm one of those fools who stops for strangers alongside the
hiway anyway, okay? <br>

COMMENTS: Stranded in Downtown Seattle, or just visiting?&nbsp; I'm located in the
International District, a short walk from Pioneer Square, near King Street Station and
within a 10-15 minute walk (or free bus ride) of the Pike Place Market.&nbsp; I'm no
mechanic, but I'm in close proximity to a well-regarded one-man VW shop (the
&quot;gentleman and a saint among mechanics&quot; guy).&nbsp; I'm happy to show you around
Downtown, help you find free parking, cook you a tasty gluten-free vegetarian dinner, and
give directions to the best local food/cofee, my favorite backpacking trails, or the
natural foods co-op.&nbsp; I also can offer space to sleep on a very comfortable couch or
floor in a 602sf studio apartment four stories above Uwajimaya, one of the largest Asian
stores in the country, but there's no such thing as a &quot;spare room&quot; in this
high-rent district!&nbsp; I also can make suggestions for free camping or affordable
hotels, B&amp;Bs, and hostels.&nbsp; I share custody of a medium-small dog with my mother
(who lives elsewhere!), and your dog is welcome to visit if she or he is under 40 pounds,
is quiet, won't make a mess, and gets along with Perkee.&nbsp; See you in Seattle!<br>

COMMENTS: Last summer I drove through 37 states. After that I tried to stay in
one spot in FL - I soon found myself collecting pets who carried their homes on
their backs (i.e. turtles, hermit crabs...). After that I decided to drive back
up to Seattle and now I am collecting camper vans. As soon as I get one running
I'll be back on the road. I have slept at rest stops and have had breakdowns -
it sucks - call me if you need help or just a new weird friend. Not too handy
yet, but I am sure I can help somehow.<br>

(it's Karma, man...!&nbsp; have some!)<br>
I may or may not be able to provide housing- but I've lived here long enough
that I have a myriad collection of friends to call on, and arrange something.&nbsp;
