AIRS is dedicated to assisting the intrepid VW traveler (All models!) when facing the occasional
breakdown (of either yourself or your trusted VW). AIRS is a loosely knit group of
volunteers of varying abilities who take the time to help other drivers in need.
The number of AIRS members is growing daily. There is no president, no dues, no
central location, and no shows. AIRS is
NOT a loan, babysitting, bail, or towing service. If you need any of those types of things
you might do well to look elsewhere. But if your VW leaves you stranded on a
friendly or non-friendly highway and you need help,&nbsp; your looking for a local &quot;vw
person&quot; to contact because your new to the area,&nbsp; or perhaps you'd even like advice or help on saving
yourself $$ on that next engine rebuild by trying it yourself, this is a place you can turn to when on the
road or at home. Just remember...chrome wont get ya home.<br>
<br>
To use this service, simply click on &quot;MAP&quot; at the top of the site, and
then click on your state. You will see a list containing
people in that state, who have expressed a willingness to help. If you would like
to use the AIRS list for your benefit, you must put your
name on the map as well and volunteer your services, whatever they may be. The
other requirement is that you report bad information such as bad email addresses and
phone numbers when using the list. <font color="#FFFF00">Failure to keep your
info updated will result in you being removed from the list! </font>Please pay attention to whether the person has put *<font color="#FF0000">ONLY CALL IF
EMERGENCY</font>* and do not call them unless it is an emergency. You can assume they probably do not have time to
meet or chat with you, but are still willing to help if your in trouble.
To sign up, click the SIGN-UP link at the top and fill out the form. It will be posted as
soon as possible. (Updates happen approx once a month.) If your info is shown on the
site but is wrong, use the EDIT link. DO NOT use the edit link if you DONT currently see your info on the site.
To be removed from the list, send me an <a href="mailto:webmaster@dropgates.com">email</a> 
and be sure to specify what state you are in. <small><small> <br>
