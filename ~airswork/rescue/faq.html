      <strong><u><font
    color="#800000">What does A.I.R.S. stand for?</font><font color="#FFFFFF"><br>
    </u></strong><br>
    <strong>A.I.R.S. is the Aircooled Interstate Rescue Squad.&nbsp; It also stands for
    truth, justice, and other good things man can do for his/her brethren.<br>
    <br>
      </strong>
    </font>
    <strong><u><font color="#800000">What is the Purpose of A.I.R.S.?</font><font
    color="#FF0000"><br>
    </font></u><font color="#FFFFFF"><br>
    The purpose of the group is to promote the driving of your Volkswagen Type 2
      bus (Late or Early model) as well as other VW's.&nbsp; We do this by offering assistance
    for a fellow VW pilot traveling from one locale to another.It also helps
      people who are new to city or state, find other VW owners to enjoy the
      hobby/lifestyle with.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font color="#800000"><u>What do you mean by &quot;assistance&quot;?<br>
    </u></font><font color="#FFFFFF"><br>
    This &quot;assistance&quot; can be rendered in times of crisis such as breakdowns.
      In fact, the group was formed after a fellow list member Steve Dolan, who at
      the time was traveling across country, had engine problems.&nbsp; A group of us
      let the <a href="http://www.type2.com">mailing list</a> know about his dilemma and the
    response was so great, it was obvious the time was right to form this group.<br>
    <br>
    The &quot;assistance&quot; might also be rendered as fellowship (the best kind in my
      opinion).&nbsp; On the type2 list there are many people who each day converse
      with one another via e-mail.&nbsp; These people sometimes pass right through
      each others cities and do not even know they are that physically close.
      A.I.R.S. promotes the meeting of these members.<br>
    <br>
    </font><u><font color="#800000">How do I use A.I.R.S.?</font><font color="#FF0000"><br>
    </font></u><font color="#FFFFFF"><br>
    The next time you are planning a trip, click to the A.I.R.S. Website.&nbsp; Find
      the states you will be driving through or near and click on them individually.
      On each states page you will find a list of names with various tidbits of information about that person.<br>
    <br>
    If they are near your route and there is time, e-mail them a message and let them know you will be traveling through their area, and what kind of VW
      you will be driving.&nbsp; They may invite you to stop in, or have coffee somewhere.
      Who knows, you might not have to crash in a hotel, or spend a long winters
      night in a campground with no electricity to power that lovable little heater you bought at Wally world.<br>
    <br>
    If you do happen to have problems along the route, say a busted tire/tyre or blown engine/injun, then they are also there to assist you in whatever way
      they can.&nbsp; Be aware, some amount of preparation should be exercised in
      anticipation of your journey.&nbsp; A.I.R.S. is not a bunch of rich people
      looking to hand out money and their time is as valuable as yours.&nbsp; Proper
      respect in the partaking of benevolent acts is just good manners.&nbsp; I will
      give no less, I will expect no less!</font></strong>
      <p>
    <strong><font color="#FFFFFF">When signing up, please put the proper name
    that you would expect to be called by, and not &quot;viper&quot; or &quot;Sabertooth&quot;
    etc. The locals may call you that, but when 3a.m. rolls around and someone
    calls your house asking for &quot;Big bad buddah&quot;, your wife or family
    may not be very happy, or you may hang up on them thinking its a prank
    because you forgot that you submitted that as your name on here 6 months
    ago.<br>
    <br>
    </font><u><font color="#800000">Are there dues for A.I.R.S.?</font><font color="#FF0000"><br>
    </font></u><font color="#FFFFFF"><br>
    The only dues required for membership are: that you help when you can, how you can, and go the extra mile if you can.&nbsp; A.I.R.S. is about giving back!
      You must sign-up on the the AIRS list if you want to use it. And the other
    requirement is that you <u>notify the webmaster</u> if any information
    provided by another member was incorrect, false, or has changed. If you call
    someone and the # has been disconnected, LET ME KNOW! if you don't, the list
    becomes inaccurate and the next person may think he has backup when
    traveling thru a state, but in reality he doesn't.&nbsp; I'm only one
    person, I can't sit around all day trying to verify 1500+ members constantly
    changing information. The success of AIRS depends on *YOU* in more ways then
    one.
    </font></strong></p>
      <p><strong><font color="#800000"><u>So how often will I be contacted?</u></font></strong></p>
      <p><strong><font color="#FFFFFF">It all depends. Some people get contacted
      all the time, others are still AIRS &quot;virgin's.&quot; Of course
      depending on how heavily traveled your area is, and how much you are
      offering in your info, that will have a lot to do with it. Again, if you
      put a poor nickname, that could effect your calls. Also if you mark
      EMERGENCY ONLY in your info, you will probably get <u>less</u> calls since
      many calls *may* revolve around &quot; Hi, I'm traveling thru the area in
      my 62 bus, mind if I stop by and check out my engine in your
      driveway?&quot; That is not an emergency call, so of course they wouldn't
      call you if you marked emergency only- You would miss all those sort of
      calls. You may also want to signup on the <a href="http://type2.com/vintagebus.html" target="_blank">vintagebus</a>
      and <a href="http://type2.com/type2.html" target="_blank">type2</a>
      discussion mailing lists- many times a driver in distress calls an AIRS
      member but he is unable to help, so he send out an SOS to the mailing
      lists for anyone close by the motorist to lend a hand. If your on the
      lists, you see that sort of thing and can help out if you can.<br>
    <br>
      </font><font color="#800000"><u>So isn't A.I.R.S. sort of contradictory to the NEATO/LIMBO
    TTT Directory?<br>
    </u></font><font color="#FFFFFF"><br>
    Absolutely not.&nbsp; We respect NEATO/LIMBO for their efforts in promoting the
      preservation of the Volkswagen bus and other air-cooled VW's.&nbsp; In fact the
      A.I.R.S. list on the internet can be used in conjunction with the TTT....Not everyone is a member of A.I.R.S. and not everyone is a member
      of NEATO/LIMBO.</font></strong></p>
      <p><font color="#800000"><u><strong>Where are you guys
    located out of?</strong></u></font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Everywhere. There is no &quot;central AIRS agency&quot;
    It is run out of each and everyone's home that is on the map, which means you if you have
    signed up.... If you mean 'where is the webmaster from', I live in Gilbert AZ, USA</strong></font></p>

    </font><font color="#800000"><u>I've submitted my form more than once and I don't see my
    name on the list!</u><br>
    </font>The AIRS site is updated manually, and I get a few submissions in my mailbox before
    I go in and do the updates. If you hit submit more than once, that means there's multiple
    submissions from you in my mailbox. Please be patient.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>In this case there was a problem. Please re-signup and in <u>addition,</u> send
    me a private email explaining the deal and we'll work something out.</strong></p>
