This is the &quot;newbie&quot; file for the type2 list. We get a lot of subscribers who
are new (or fairly new) to the Internet. If you've never been on a mailing list
before, you are STRONGLY encouraged to read this file.



MAILING LISTS -- what they are, how they work
---------------------------------------------

Mailing lists are the oldest information &quot;protocol&quot; on the net. They take place
entirely through email messages. Very basically, here is how the &quot;mechanics&quot;

work:

--a subscriber like you sends an email message about buses to a &quot;reflector&quot;. The
&quot;reflector&quot; is usually called the list server or listserv.

--the server takes your single email message and re-sends it to every subscriber
on the list. This is done with automated software; there is no human
intervention.

--the other subscribers can then read your message as if you had sent it
straight to them. They can reply to you only, or they can reply to the list, in
which case the whole process repeats itself (or of course they can not reply at
all).


THE LIST SERVER -- understand how it works
------------------------------------------

The server--the &quot;machine&quot; that distributes the list to its subscribers--is
software, just like the software you use every day on your computer. When you
use your software, you control it by clicking on icons or choosing options from
menus or typing input.

You can also control the list server, just like you can control your own
programs. Like all other software, list servers exist for the sole purpose of
doing what humans want done.

But the list server is just a little different because it doesn't live on your
computer, so you can't point and click. The list server lives somewhere else--it
can be anywhere in the world. So instead of pointing and clicking, you tell the
list server what to do by sending commands to it in email messages. The server
will receive your message, extract the command from it, and act on it. Then it
will usually send you back a &quot;receipt&quot; so you know your command was succesful.
Pretty cool, no?

There aren't that many commands because list servers are not very complicated
(at least as far as the subscribers are concerned). The only commands you really
need to worry about are subscribe (which starts the list mail coming) and
unsubscribe (which stops it). The important thing is to understand that the
server is just a bit of software. Now we'll talk about how to control that
software.



THE LIST IS NOT THE SERVER -- there's a big difference
------------------------------------------------------

This is where many newbies get tripped up. The LIST is where you send messages
about buses. The LIST SERVER is where you send administrative commands, like
unsubscribe. The way you can tell them apart is that they have DIFFERENT EMAIL
ADDRESSES. This will be true for every mailing list you will ever be on.

In our case, list messages should always be sent to this address--this is the
address of the &quot;reflector&quot;:

   type2@type2.com


And here is the list server's address:

   
   type2-request@type2.com     (if you are not on digest)

or

   type2-digest-request@type2.com     (if you are on digest)


See? Adding &quot;-request&quot; to the list address makes the mail go to the server
instead of the list. This will work with all other lists you'll come across,
too; while there are lots of different mailing list software schemes out there,
sending mail to listname-request@host will nearly always work--and if it
doesn't, it will get you an automated response that tells you what you need to
do differently. The important thing is to NEVER post administrative commands to
the list. It won't do what you want done and it will make the subscribers and
the administrator angry.



THE DIGEST -- messages within messages 
--------------------------------------


Most lists come in two flavors. You can get the list in &quot;real-time&quot; or

&quot;individual message&quot; flavor. If you choose this one, you get each list message
as it's posted. This lets you see each message immediately and it makes replying
somewhat easier. The downside is that it can cause serious mailbox clutter,
especially on busy lists like ours, and it takes up a lot more space on your
disk because of all the useless header information you'll get. Understand that
dealing with colossal amounts of data is a learned skill--and if you haven't
honed that skill yet, we strongly suggest that you get the list in digest
flavor.


In digest, the server packs up lots of individual messages in one big one. Our
digests come out when accumulated messages reach a threshold of about 32K bytes.
This usually contains about 20 messages, but it could be more and could be as
few as three. You'll get three or four digests on an average day, less on
weekends when we're slow.

If you want to switch to digest, send an unsubscribe message to:

   type2-request@type2.com

and then send a subscribe message to:

   type2-digest-request@type2.com


If you subscribed from the type2.com web page, you're already on digest so you
should probably just leave it. If you really want to switch to real-time, you
can infer the way to do it from what I just told you. If you can't figure it
out, you should definitely stay on digest. ;)

The downside to digest mode is that when you reply to a message, you have to
paste in an appropriate subject line. If you forget to do this, your message
will be intercepted by the server (which knows to search for these) and returned
to you.



YOUR MAIL PROGRAM -- understand how it works
--------------------------------------------

It is crucial that you understand this. I'm not gonna ask you to read the
documentation that came with your mail program because I've never read mine
either, but I am going to ask you to experiment a little.

You MUST know who you are replying to when you reply to a list message.

You can end up with any of three sorts of reply:

--you can reply to the list only  (not recommended but not discouraged) --you
can reply to the sender of the message only  (we'll go over this) --you can
reply to both the sender and the list (we'll go over that too)

Your reply will go to the addresses in the &quot;To:&quot; and the &quot;Cc:&quot; lines of your
reply. &quot;Cc:&quot; means &quot;carbon copy&quot; and in practice it is exactly the same thing as
&quot;To:&quot;. All mail programs let you see and edit these header lines. MAKE SURE that
your message is going where it should go.

You should reply to the SENDER ONLY if your reply might not be interesting to
everybody on the list. Examples:


&quot;I have one of those gizmos you're looking for.&quot;

&quot;I'm interested in buying the barndoor you're advertising for sale.&quot;

&quot;Way to go, Bubba!&quot;

&quot;I think when we go camping at Mountain Meadows we should bring plenty of toilet
paper.&quot;

You should reply to the LIST AND THE SENDER if your reply contains information
that you think will be useful to everybody on the list. The reason you reply to
both is to make sure the sender sees your message; he'll get your reply by
private mail even if he misses it on the list. Examples:

&quot;The total advance of the 009  differs, depending on whether it's German or
Brazilian.&quot;

&quot;I had a bad experience with Shyster Mail-Order Parts, too. Here's what
happened.&quot;

I said I was going to ask you to experiment: figure out what the reply options
are in your particular mail program. Try different things and WATCH YOUR
HEADERS. Usually, you can choose between &quot;reply&quot; and &quot;reply to all&quot;, but see
what works for you. Do not send messages that don't turn out right, of course.
Delete those and start over.
