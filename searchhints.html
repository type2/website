<center><h2>Advanced boolean search
</h2></center>
<p>For more advanced searching you should select the "Boolean" Search 
Type in the search form.</p>
<p>mnoGoSearch understands the following boolean operators:</p>
<p><b>&</b> - logical AND. For example, "mysql & odbc". mnoGoSearch will 
find any URLs that contain both "mysql" and "odbc". You can also use 
<b>+</b> for this operator.</p>
<p><b>|</b> - logical OR. For example "mysql|odbc". mnoGoSearch will find 
any URLs that contain word "mysql" or word 
"odbc".</p>
<p><b>~</b> - logical NOT. For example "mysql & ~odbc". mnoGoSearch will 
find URLs that contain word "mysql" and do not contain word "odbc" at the 
same time. Note that ~ just excludes given word from results. Query 
"~odbc" will find nothing! You can also use <b>-</b> for this operator.</p>
<p><b>()</b> - group command to compose more complex queries. For example 
"(mysql | msql) & ~postgres". Query language is simple and powerful at the 
same time. Just consider query as usual boolean expression.</p>

<p><center><h2>Phrase searches</h2></center></p>

<p>To perform a search for a phrase, select the "Boolean" search type and

com</b><br>
For <b>sample-user@example.com</b> you should use <b>sample user example 
com</b></p>

<p>You may use as much or as little of the email address as you wish, you
may also combine with phrase style searches or Date searches.</p>
