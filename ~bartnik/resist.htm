 The series resistors are in the fuel injector circuit.  They are mounted
 on the firewall (in Buses and Vanagons) on the driver's side, next to
 the double relay.  It's a metal case surrounding four resistors, one for
 each injector.

These resistors simply limit the current flow to the <A HREF="inject.htm">injectors</A>.  I only
 mention them here in case someone might wonder what they are.  They can
 be tested with an ohmmeter for the proper resistance, and that's about
 it.
 <P>
 The Bosch book by Charles Probst says that on some other L-Jetronic
 models these resistors were superseded and the current limiting was
 built into the injector windings.  Later injector windings are brass
 while the ones used on our beloved vehicles are copper.
