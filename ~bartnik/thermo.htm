 The thermo-time switch, as mounted on the Type 4 engine, is basically
 inaccessible (see notes below).  It is under the intake air distributor, so that must be
 removed before you can get to the switch.  The switch is mounted with
 one of the case bolts.  It may be a bit more accessible on the Beetle.
 <P>
 The thermo-time switch consists of a contact to ground for the <A HREF="cold.htm">cold
 start valve</A> and a bimetallic strip surrounded by a heater winding.  When
 the engine is cold and the key is turned to "start,"
 the bimetallic strip contacts the ground contact and
 allows the cold start injector to inject fuel.  When the key is turned
 to "on," that powers the heating element inside the thermo-time
 switch.  As the heater warms the bimetallic strip, it eventually bends
 away and stops grounding the cold start valve.  
 <P>
 This all happens in 10 seconds or less.  This is to keep the cold start
 valve from injecting too much fuel and flooding the engine.  So if the
 engine doesn't start within the 10 seconds, the thermo-time switch will
 shut off the cold start valve to keep the engine from flooding for
 future starting attempts.  When the engine is already hot, the contact
 in the thermo-time switch is open, preventing the cold start valve from
 operating.  A stuck closed thermo-time switch could allow the cold start
 valve to operate too long during starting, causing engine flooding (but
 regardless, the cold start valve will still only operate when the starter
 is operating).  If the thermo-time switch sticks open, it could keep the
 cold start valve from operating and cause hard cold starting.
 <P>
 The thermo-time switch can be tested electrically.  The temperature at
 which the switch activates is stamped on the switch housing.  You can
 install a test lamp in series with the wire to the thermo-time switch,
 disable the ignition, and crank the starter.  The lamp should light but
 then go out in a few seconds of cranking.  
 <P>
 The switch can also be tested for resistance between the two terminals.
 It should vary with temperature, being close to zero when the switch is
 below the temperature marked on the housing and being infinite when the
 switch is warm.
 <P>
The below addendum was sent to me by someone who read the article.  It
refers to removal of the thermo-time switch from a late Bus.

Hi Sean, Just found your web page and think its great to have this stuff
on line.  Thanks.   I have been fixing my thermo time switch lately on my
'77 Westy.  It can be gotten off simply buy applying a 15/16 inch socket
to the switch after removing the electrical connection.  First, it helps if
you remove the vacuum line going into the air box, and fuel line going to
the cold start valve.  I know Bentley says you have to take everything off
but it just was not so for me.  This could save others lots of time.
