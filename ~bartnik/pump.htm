 The fuel pump is mounted in various places on the different VWs that
 have fuel injection.  On the Bus, the fuel pump is located underneath
 the vehicle, near the left rear wheel.  On the Vanagon, it is located on
 the passenger side middle of the van, mounted to the frame.  On the
 Beetle and Super Beetle it is probably mounted at the front under the
 gas tank.  In all models it is a cylindrical device mounted to the car
 with shock-absorbing mounts and in line with the fuel line from the gas
 tank.

The fuel injection system works at a higher pressure than the carbureted
 engines do.  Therefore, the fuel injection system uses a special high
 pressure electric fuel pump as opposed to the mechanical pump used on
 the carbureted engines.  The mechanical pump put out 3-5 psi of pressure
 while the fuel injection system operates at 28 psi.
 <P>
 The pump is a roller-cell pump.  The fuel enters and is pressurized by
 the rotating motion of the roller and the elliptical pressure chamber.
 It's very similar in operation to a rotary engine.  The gasoline then
 flows through the rest of the pump where it is used to cool the pump
 motor and then flows out of the pump into the fuel line.  The pump also
 has a pressure limiting valve (basically a spring-loaded stopper) that
 returns fuel to the tank if pressure in the lines goes over a set limit.
 There is also a check valve on the output side of the pump which closes
 when the pump stops to keep the fuel lines pressurized when the engine
 is not running.  This allows quicker restarts and serves to prevent
 vapor lock.
 <P>
 Vapor lock, for the curious, is what happens when the fuel in the lines
 evaporates to a vapor instead of being a liquid.  Vapors don't pump very
 well, so vapor lock can prevent an engine from being started.  This is
 usually only a problem in hot weather with carbureted vehicles.  The
 problem is largely non-existent in fuel-injected vehicles.
 <P>
 The fuel pump is initially powered through the <A HREF="dblrly.htm">double relay</A> when the key
 is turned to the start position.  The pump operates as long as the
 starter operates.  When the starter is turned off, the double relay
 stops supplying 12v to the pump, but by then the air flow meter fuel
 pump safety switch has kicked in, allowing the fuel pump to continue
 running.  In the event of an accident where the engine stalls, the fuel
 pump, thanks to the safety switch in the <A HREF="afm.htm">air flow meter</A>, will stop
 pumping fuel and the check valve in the pump will close, preventing
 siphoning from the gas tank.
