The below chart was posted to the Vanagon list by Joel Walker.  It applies
to Vanagon VINs.
<P>
On the Vanagon, the VIN is located on the dashboard on the driver's side.  
It can be viewed from outside the van, looking in through the windshield.  
The VIN is also on a sticker that is visible when the driver's door is
open.  The sticker is on the lower part of the door frame, near the seat.

<P>
For Buses and other air-cooled VWs from roughly 1967-1979, a different format
was used for the VIN.  The VIN followed a format like xxx xxx xxxxx.
<P>
The first three numbers of the VIN tell you the most about the vehicle.  For example, the '78 Bus I used to have started its VIN with 228.  The first number
gives the model type of the vehicle, in this case a Type 2, or "Bus."
The second number is basically a subdivision of the model line.  For example,
My '78 Bus was a 7-passenger model.  Campers or panel vans would have 
different middle numbers.  The third digit tells you the year of the vehicle.
Mine was a 1978 Bus, hence the third digit is an 8.  
<P>
This works also with other cars.  For example, the Beetle I once had had a 
VIN that started with 115, indicating a Type 1, a Beetle, and the 1975 model
year.  The Karmann Ghia I currently have has a VIN starting with 144, 
indicating Type 1, Karmann Ghia, and 1974.
