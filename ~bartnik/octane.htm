There seems to be much confusion in the VW world about which octane gasoline 
should be used with air-cooled Volkswagen engines.  Many people say 91 octane.
Those people are technically right, as long as they are not in the US.
<P>
Volkswagen recommended 91 RON octane gasoline for use with their air-cooled
engines.  However, here is where the confusion sets in:  The RON method of
octane measurement is not used in the United States.  In the US, a different
method entirely is used, called the CLC method.  The number that results from
this method is the average of the RON octane number and the MON octane number,
so (RON + MON)/2 = CLC octane number.  This is the number that you will find
printed on a yellow label on gas pumps in the United States.
<P>
91 RON octane is equivalent to 87 CLC octane.  My source for this claim is the
Volkswagen owner's manual for both the 1978 Bus, the 1974 Karmann Ghia, and
the 1981 Vanagon.

Therefore, if you are buying premium gasoline in the US because you think you
need it, you are mistaken and are wasting a lot of money.  A stock VW engine
with stock ignition timing, etc., will run without problems on regular 87 
CLC octane gasoline in the US.  
<P>
Octane has to do with the resistance of a fuel to preignition, that is, 
detonating in the combustion chamber before the spark plug fires.  This 
event is destructive to cylinder heads and the VW air-cooled engines are
especially vulnerable to damage caused by this "pinging."  If you are experiencing pinging with a stock engine, there is most likely something wrong with
your timing setings.  Use your timing light to check your ignition timing
persuant to my <A HREF="timing.htm">article on ignition timing</A>.  A fuel with a 
high octane number is more resistant to preignition than a fuel with a lower
octane number.  The only reason you would NEED high-octane fuel would be if 
you had a high-compression engine, which you don't if you have a stock VW
air-cooled engine.  
<P>
Some people like to use high-octane fuel because they feel it gives them
better gas mileage or perhaps cooler engine temperatures.  If you like to
use high-octane gasoline, go ahead.  It won't hurt anything except your wallet.
However, this article is just so that you will not buy high-octane gasoline
under the mistaken impression that it is necessary because VW recommended it.
That's just not true.
