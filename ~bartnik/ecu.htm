 The electronic control unit, or ECU, is the brain of the fuel injection
 system.  It is a silver-colored box, mounted in various locations on different
 models.  One way to find it is to follow the fuel injection wiring
 harness as all wires lead to the control unit (terminating in a large
 plug on the unit).  In the Vanagon, the ECU is mounted in the engine
 compartment on the right side, close to the right taillight assembly.
 In the Bus, it's mounted in the engine compartment, immediately forward
 of the battery.  In the Beetle and Super Beetle, it's mounted in the
 rear luggage compartment.

The ECU processes all the inputs from the various sensors on board and
 uses that information to determine the optimum amount of fuel to be
 injected, which it controls by varying the amount of time the <A HREF="inject.htm">fuel
 injectors</A> are open.  
 <P>
 The ECU cannot be electrically tested.  The ECU should only be assumed faulty if
 absolutely everything else in the ignition system, fuel system, and fuel
 injection system has proven to be working properly.
