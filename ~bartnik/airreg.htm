On the Type 4 engine, the auxiliary air regulator is located immediately
behind the intake air distributor.  It's a cylindrical object with an
electrical connection on one end and two large air hoses.  One hose
comes from the S-boot after the air flow meter and goes into one end of
the auxiliary air regulator and the other hose goes from the regulator
to the intake air distributor.

The auxiliary air regulator provides for a slightly fast idle for a cold
engine.  It does this by allowing more air in, bypassing the closed
throttle valve.  It does not, however, change the fuel/air mixture
because the air entering the auxiliary air regulator has already been
measured by the <A HREF="afm.htm">air flow meter</A>.  It just lets some air bypass the
throttle body for a fast idle to help keep the cold engine running.
<P>
There is a rotary valve in the housing, with one hole in it.  This valve
is connected to a bimetallic strip.  When the engine is cold, the
bimetallic strip rotates the valve so that the hole is aligned with the
two air hoses -- air can pass through the valve.  When the ignition is
turned on, a heating element begins to warm the bimetallic strip.  As
the strip warms, it begins to close the valve.  From the coldest, the
valve will close in about 8 minutes.  When fully warm, no air will pass
through the regulator.
<P>
The regulator can be tested by blowing through it with the engine cold
-- air should pass freely.  When the engine is warm, you should not be
able to blow through it.
