 The cylinder head temperature sensor can be found screwed into the
 cylinder head by the number 3 cylinder.  It's simply a little black metal
 thing with a single wire coming from it.

This sensor is exactly like the intake air temperature sensor in the air
 flow meter.  It's a solid-state resistor, called a thermistor.  Its
 resistance varies inversely with temperature.  The warmer it is, the
 lower its resistance.
 <P>
 The <A HREF="ecu.htm">ECU</A> sends the sensor a fixed voltage signal and can tell the engine
 temperature by the resistance it measures.  The sensor can be tested
 with an ohmmeter at various temperatures to see if it is within original
 specifications.  If not, the sensor must be replaced.
 <P>
 This sensor is one of the main inputs used by the ECU to determine how
 much fuel to inject, so it is important that it be working properly.  If
 the wiring breaks, for example, the ECU will see infinite ohms as the
 resistance measurement and will go into a "full-rich" mode where the
 engine will be running extremely rich and get very poor fuel mileage.
