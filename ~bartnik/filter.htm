I think the fuel filter is worth mentioning here as a fuel injection
 component mainly because clean fuel is extremely important to a fuel
 injection system.  Dirty fuel can lead to clogged <A HREF="inject.htm">injectors</A> and all
 kinds of headaches.

The fuel filter is mounted near the <A HREF="pump.htm">pump</A>, in the fuel line upstream of
 the pump, i.e. the fuel flows through the filter before it flows through
 the pump.  This is important not only to make sure that the pump gets
 clean fuel but because a filter on the pressure side can be dangerous.
 If the filter were to become clogged and fuel flow was significantly
 restricted, theoretically fuel pressure could build to dangerous levels
 and rupture fuel lines, causing gas leaks and possible fire hazards.  In
 practice, this probably wouldn't happen as the pressure limiter in the
 fuel pump would prevent it, but engineers don't like to tempt fate and
 it's considered bad practice to put a fuel filter on the pressure side
 of the system.

 The filter is a somewhat large rectangular plastic box with a filter
 element designed to catch even very small particles.  There is a paper
 filter element and immediately after that is a strainer.  Charles O.
 Probst, in his Bosch fuel injection book, mentions that the paper filter
 has a medium pore size of 10 micrometers.

 The filters on our beloved Volkswagens have to be replaced every so
 often.  You usually know when you have to replace it by how the van
 starts bucking and jerking at high rpm, meaning fuel starvation due to a
 clogged filter.  Of course, other things can cause those symptoms, but a
 clogged filter is always a possibility.
