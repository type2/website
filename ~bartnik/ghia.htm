This Karmann Ghia was owned by my aunt and uncle.  They moved out of 
the country, and so they put it up for sale, and gave me first dibs.  
The car is a 1974 model.  The original color is Ravenna Green, but the
POs had it painted when they bought it in 1977.  It also has a fairly new
top and is in generally very good shape.  The engine was original, with 
only 84,000 miles on it.  It has been garage-kept for many years and not
driven very much.  While I had it I kept it up well, eventually having to rebuild the engine.
Soon after that, an opportunity arose for me to buy a very nice '79 Westy, which I did.  To buy that van, I had to sell the Karmann Ghia, which I also did.  It was sad to see it go but good to know it was going to a good home.
