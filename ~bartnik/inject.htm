 The fuel injectors (4) are found where the intake air runners connect to
 the cylinder heads.  The injectors are mounted there, and each has a
 fuel and electrical connection.  There are two injectors on each side of
 the engine.

<P>
The injectors are the fuel delivery vehicles for the engine, atomizing
 the fuel for proper and efficient combustion.
 <P>
 The injectors are nothing more than solenoid valves.  There is a valve
 that is held closed by spring pressure until the control unit sends an
 electrical signal to the injector, which travels through a winding,
 creating a magnetic field, which lifts the solenoid, allowing fuel to
 flow through the injector.  The tip on the end of the injector helps to
 atomize the fuel in a cone-shaped spray.
 <P>
 The injectors are supplied with power all the time and are activated
 when the <A HREF="ecu.htm">control unit</A> grounds them.  The amount of fuel injected is
 determined by the control unit through the length of time that the
 control unit holds the injectors open.  The injectors are all activated
 by the control unit at the same time, not in a sequential manner.  They
 are activated once every crankshaft revolution.  The control unit gets
 this information from a wire that connects to the negative terminal on
 the ignition coil.  
<P>
The fuel pressure also affects how much fuel is injected, however the control unit has no control over or knowledge of the fuel pressure.  The fuel pressure is maintained by a purely mechanical device, the <A HREF="reg.htm">fuel pressure regulator</A>.
 <P>
 The injectors can be tested for fuel leakage by removing them from the
 intake manifold (leaving the fuel and electrical connections intact) and
 operating the fuel pump, measuring how much fuel leaks in a specified
 time period.  
 <P>
 The injectors can be tested for the proper spray pattern by removing
 them from the intake manifold (leaving the electrical and fuel
 connections intact) and running the starter briefly, making sure the
 spray pattern is an even cone shape.  A bad spray pattern can cause
 rough running due to improper fuel atomization.  
 <P>
 The electrical connections to the injectors can also be checked with a
 test lamp to make sure the injectors are getting power.
