<H2>Westfalia Propane Tank Removal</H2>

The propane tank on my '81 Westy had developed a leak in the on/off
valve located on the tank.  I decided to remove the tank and have the
valve replaced by a local RV store.  To facilitate the replacement of
the valve, the tank should be removed from the car, which is really not
all that hard.
<P>
The first step is to make sure the tank is empty or else the service guy
will get a surprise when he removes the old valve.  You can either use
up all the propane that's in there (which is what I did) or vent it in a
safe area.  The venting idea makes me nervous, so I just used up the
existing propane.  
<P>
The next step is to remove the rock guard from under the tank.  It's
attached to the tank with a couple of nuts and bolts.  Mine were 13mm.
This is not a very challenging step :-)

In the above photo, the tank is shown "before" with the rock guard
installed.  You can see the nuts and bolts that attach the guard to the
tank.
<P>
The next step is to disconnect the propane lines, which proved to be an
adventure on my tank.  The thing to remember is that a lot of gas stuff
has left-hand threads, so you actually have to turn it clockwise to
loosen it, which is the opposite of how it's usually done.  I don't
remember if the Westy gas connections are left-hand threads or not, but
I think they are.  The nuts are a bit big for any regular wrench I had,
so I had to use an adjustable.  The trick was to undo the nuts on the
union without torquing the copper pipes too much.  The way I did it was
to use two adjustable wrenches, one on the union nut I was undoing and
another on the box to the left of the regulator to hold the assembly in
place.  This worked like a charm.
<P>
Once you have the lines disconnected, you can remove the tank.  If you
look up from under the car, you will see that there are four bolts that
hold the tank in place.  The best way to do it is to completely remove
the two inboard bolts and only loosen the outboard bolts.  The mounting
holes in the tank are open-ended, so you lower the inboard side and then
pull it off the outboard bolts.  The tank was not as heavy as I thought
it would be.

The photo above shows the tank on the ground.  You can see that the tank
mounts are open-ended.  The various things on the tank, from right to
left, are:  The 80% valve, the fill valve, the on/off valve, the
regulator, and the "splitter" which simply puts the propane into two
lines, one for the stove and one for the refrigerator.
<P>
At this point I took the tank to the RV store and had them put a new
valve on.  They put the new valve on and put a little propane in it to
check for leaks.  With the new valve, the tank was ready to re-install.

The photo above shows the new valve installed on the tank.  The yellow
stuff is teflon tape, used to help seal the threads.
<P>
OK, re-installation really is the reverse of removal.  The toughest part
is holding the tank up against the car while you attempt to thread a
couple bolts in with crap falling in your eyes.  Once you get the bolts
in, you reattach the propane lines (as tight as you can get, I had a
small leak until I tightened a little more) and then put the rock guard
back on.  Now you can go get it filled.  The photo below shows the tank
reinstalled with the new valve but before installation of the rock
guard.
