<H2>Fan Belt Adjustment, Type 1 Engine</H2>
<P>
<HR ALIGN=CENTER>
<P>
<B>APPLICATION:</B>  This should apply to all air-cooled Volkswagens fitted with 
the upright fan housing Type 1 engine.  This would be all Beetles and
Super Beetles, all Karmann Ghias, all Things (181s), and Buses through 1971.
<P>
<B>TOOLS NEEDED:</B>  Hefty screwdriver; wrench to fit alternator/generator pulley
nut.  This nut was 19mm on my Karmann Ghia.  
<P>
Adjustment for the fan belt tension on a Type 1 engine is kinda goofy 
compared to more modern cars.  Since the generator/alternator is in a fixed
place on this engine, VW had to provide for adjustment of the fan belt
another way.  They did this with shims.  The alternator/generator pulley
is really two separate halves.  To adjust the belt tension, the pulley nut
is removed and shims are added to or subtracted from the space between the 
pulley halves.  Adding shims decreases belt tension, and subtracting shims
increases belt tension.
<P>
The belt should be at least tight enough so that turning the 
generator/alternator pulley with a wrench also turns the engine.  If it is
too loose, turning the pulley will just turn the generator/alternator shaft
while the belt slips on the pulley.  In this particular engine, proper fan
belt tension is vital, since any belt slipping reduces the amount of cooling
air that is supplied by the fan to the engine.  Of course, having the belt
too tight can cause premature wear on the alternator/generator bearings.
<P>
When depressed by thumb pressure midway between the two pulleys, the belt
should give approximately 1/2".
<P>
If the tension is more or less than this, it must be adjusted to bring the
tension into specification.
<P>
To adjust the tension, first you must remove the pulley nut.  Observe that
there are some notches in the front half of the pulley (front is front).
Take your big screwdriver and stick that in one of the notches so you can
hold the pulley stationary while using your wrench to loosen the pulley bolt.
Once you have the bolt off, you see a metal bell-looking thing, and under
that are some shims.  Remove all that stuff and then remove the rear pulley
half.  Then add or subtract shims as required to bring your belt tension
into specification.
<P>
The problem with this adjustment method is that you have to guess how many
shims you need to add or subtract, then put it all back together and check 
it.  If it's still not correct, then you have to go back and do it again.
This is not the best design, but I have to admit it works.  
<P>
Once you've got the belt adjusted correctly, make sure you tighten the 
alternator/generator pulley nut sufficiently, and you're done.
