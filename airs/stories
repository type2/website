<p>I have found myself in greater problems than being stuck in the
side of the road in my bus. However, it is frustrating- especially
when you have no idea what it is thats causing the engine to
stallout. In my search for the answer, I turned to AIRS. After
about<br>
fifteen disconnected phone numbers, I finally got ahold of a few
folksin South Dakota who offered a hand. Not much can be done over
the phone but the support was certainly appreciated. I finally got
ahold of a gent who was in the area and within ten minutes offered
to have me stop by, or meet up if I couldn't get Vosgoing. I did
manage to get Vos running long enough to take the short hike upto
the house.Getting to the point, I was welcomed into a home, put up
for a night,fed, and got everything figured out. Thanks justin, I
hope the fam iswell.<br></p>
<hr>
<p>I've got an involved story that involves lots of help from
Portland area AIRS members after a blown engine, getting taken by a
local con-man, and more help and friendships from AIRS members as
the story unfolds. You can read about the whole thing starting
here:<br>

Not sure what we would have done without the help from folks on
this list! THANK YOU!<br>

<div>I'm on my way driving back home to NH from Florida. It's a
beautiful day down in Georgia, my second day on the road. I have to
be back within a few days as I promised to be backto work at the
garage. I've been working as a mechanic since I got my 79
Transporter in order to be able to afford fixing it!</div>
<div>I trust in my engine rebuilt 12,000 miles ago with new pistons
and cylinders AND the big oil cooler I installed last summer. I
gotoil temperature and pressure gauges; I've been driving 70-75 Mph
since the beginning of this trip! Everything seems to be
cool.</div>
<div>So, I'm driving on I-85, joyful and fast, turns out to be a
little too fast. Suddenly, I see smoke behind me and pull over.
Right side valve cover is leaking oil onto the heat exchangers!
There's enough oil pressure, so I manage to drive a couple miles to
a construction site by the highway.</div>
<div>The situation looks very much like a blow-by I had before, and
there's that nasty noise coming from the right side of the engine.
Cursing myself and trying to stay calm, I pull out my AIRS list
that I usually carry on road trips and find the South Caroline
pages; I'm about 15 miles from the state border. With one of the
nice construction worker's cell phone, I dial Phillip Cain's
number. He's a certified mechanic and he claims to be "retired"! I
explain the situation and my game plan while asking his expertise
on the subject. He thinks I'm on the right track, tells me to check
the oil breather to make sure it is not clogged up and kindly
reminds me to call him back if I'm still in trouble.</div>
<div>I take out the high-temp RTV sealer, clean the valve cover
with some lighter fuel I happen to have, and seal the valve cover.
The goalis trying tostop the leak and driving SLOWLY to the next
town. No leaks now! But, there's that noise, AND after 15 minutes
or so I see smoke coming out of the tail pipe! Smoke is a sure sign
of the big trouble I'm in!</div>
<div>Well, this wasn't a dream I had, it actually happened! I
called Phillip from the next town. He gave me directions to the
FULL MOON BUS CLUB garage. Next day we pulled out the engine. The
top of #1 piston was melted. Phillip, the MASTER MECHANIC, said my
injector failed and it leaned on me! He brought a used one to
replace the existing injector and I safely made it back home.
Second day, weinstalled new pistons and cylinders. At the end of
the third day, I was heading back home, and drove the last 1000
miles with no problems at all! YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME!</div>
<div>Dear Chris, it was a pleasure working with you. Thanks for all
your help!</div>
<div>Dear Buddah, my home is also your home. Thanks for your
hospitality!</div>
<div>Dear Phillip, your knowledge and experience is heart warming.
Thanks for giving away to people!</div>
<div>Of course, it goes without saying how grateful we areto those
who started the Type2 AIRS list AND those who formed the FULL MOON
BUS CLUB. It is so nice to show the world that money cannot buy
friendship and support for our fellow people:)</div>
<div>Thank you,</div>

<p>Stuttgart, Germany, June 2000. We set off in our 1979
Eurocamper, with custom comfortable interior layout and a fresh
MOFOCO 1600cc upright complete with .040 heads and 1 1/2 qt. deep
sump to the Arctic Bussing paradise of Finland. After an uneventful
trip to Rostock, Germany, a 28 hour ferry ride to Helsinki,
Finland, a stamp in the ol' Passport we were Bussing in Scandinavia
where "every mans right" a Scandinavian law, dictates "you can camp
wherever you like as long as you bother no one" swings in full
effect. This established, let us move on to the tale. Two weeks
into this lusty Bus trip to end all Bus trips, I overestimated the
abilities of my motor and pointed our fair steed up a mile long
climb of 22% uphill grade. First gear was barely hanging on while
we held on to the dash to prevent us from falling out of our seats.
Halfway up this damnable grade, something in the go department said
"uncle." A quick inspection revealed nothing, but a detailed
inpection later revealed a #1 spark plug had nearly punched out due
to excessive cracking in the plug threads. Experiencing a sever
lack of, dare I say "horsepower" at 64 degrees North latitude is
not where you want to find yourself. All 4 plugs were in
solidarity, all cracked, all blowing precious compression out the
tops of the heads in useless gasps of heat and agony. A trip to the
local mechanic revealed our doom to us. "You must go to Sweden to
seek the Bus parts you require" was the gurus best answer to our
sorry state of affairs. Fine and good. Sweden was on our plan as
the route to return to Germany. Problem was. We had not planned to
limp a very sick bus the 1400 kilometers (<a href=
"mailto:d@#n">d@#n</a> near 950 miles) to the Nirvana known as
Sweden. 4 days that infernal trip lasted. 35 mph was the average,
12 hours a day knowing that at any moment, the trip could end in a
huff of smoke, or worse yet, that spine shattering "Krunch" of a
dropped exhaust valve (shudder). Finally, North of Stockholm. We
found a sports bar with internet that directed us, via the AIRS
page, to one John Bellanger (check AIRS SWEDEN) who after a
panicked cell phone call, let us know that everything would be just
fine when we got to Linkoeping, Sweden. Ahhhhh, salvation! "Honey,
find Linkoeping on the map" I said to my darling wife. "Here it is!
Only 200 miles away!" Was her reply. "Great! Only 200 miles" Was my
reply, "perhaps we should discuss this with the ailing Bus.... The
Bus arrived in Linkoeping, with it's precious cargo of us, arrived
6 hours later to the welcome arms of John Bellanger's more than
ample VW garage! "No problem", was John's answer to the steaming
hot MOFOCO monstrosity that lay on the floor of his 4 car garage.
"It's too hot to work on. Why don't you come over for a BBQ while
your motor cools off)? Not wanting to look at that Bus of mine
until I had a few "cold ones" in me, I quickly took him up on his
offer. Well fed, I broke the engine down and discovered my heads
were shot! Cracks radiating from the plug holes reaching twixt the
valves and emanating to the valve seats of all cylinders. John, the
gentleman, took time off from his job to procure the parts we
needed and in a matter of 36 hours had us the most beautiful set of
CB performance .050 heads complete with stainless steel valves and
a vision of hope that this vacation was going to continue at 60mph!
3 days later, after staying in John's well equipped garage in our
lifeless Bus (I tried to keep the intrusion to a minimum) we were
up, and really rolling! My Bus had never run that good! Those CB
performance heads were just the ticket! 65mph up hill with a 1600cc
motor!?! Our trip back home to Germany come off without a hitch!
From the depths of depression, Phoenix rose from the ashes. Born
again with a spirit not seen before. The beauty of the Bus. If it's
running, it will run. I am a much more careful Bus operator now.
Oil temp gauge, cylinder head temp gauge, oil pressure gauge all up
front for my pleasure. Without the help of AIRS member John
Bellanger, this trip would have nose dived. Instead, he gave our
favorite vehicle a new lease on life! My thanks to all the
Volkswagen Junkies of Linkoeping, Sweden and plan to pass on the
good will when my phone rings and there is another lost soul of
Bussdom on the other end needing a fix of Bus Love! Thanks
John!</p>

<p>This morning I received a call from a Bills Downs (from Atlanta,
anyone know him?) who was on his way back home from West Virginia.
He's currently in Statesville, where his engine has evidently given
up the ghost. His 1969 bus is at a garage in Statesville, and he's
staying at a friend's house. The garage is telling him that he
needs a new engine and is quoting an unreasonable price for the
job. Bill called me seeking ideas on how to get his bus to the
Southern part of Georgia, where his trusted VW mechanic is. His
mechanic has supposedly located a good engine and is negotiating to
purchase it on Bill's behalf. Bill, who had gotten back to Atlanta
by other means and has purchased a used car, came back to
Statesville with the intent of renting a tow dolly and pulling his
bus back. However, he ran into the ol' "we won't rent a dolly to
any one driving a vehicle with less that a 5,000 lb hitch" deal.
Bill has checked and the biggest hitch he can put on his car is
3,500 lbs. I suggested to Bill that if he can obtained a reliable
engine, he ought to consider just bringing the engine to
Statesville where we would be able to install it for him in short
order. This hadn't occurred to Bill, who by his own admission is no
mechanic, but he liked the idea. Here's the question. The garage in
Statesville has declared the engine dead and told Bill they didn't
think it is a transmission problem. Bill said that prior to
Statesville he was gradually losing power, until it reached the
point it would barely move. I can sort of hold my own working on my
own bus, but I've never dealt with my transmission, and I am not
experienced at diagnosing things over the phone (the right
questions never seem to come to mind). Bill said the engine will
start, but has no power. He said if the engine is off, and you put
the bus in gear, it will roll. If his clutch is gone, it would
roll, but wouldn't it then not move at all under it's own power?
What problems with the transmission should he/we check for? I can
bring an extra transmission (unknown) with me if we go down to help
with the engine swap, and clutch problems should be readily
detectable after we pull the engine, but I'd like to be able to
evaluate the transmission. Bill's supposed to call me back later
today and let me know what arrangements he has been able to make
about the replacement engine. It looks like I might be driving to
Statesville Saturday morning. I'd appreciate any ideas and
input.Thanks,--Chad SibertGreensboro, NC</p>

<p>Hey, All - This bus-venturer looked me up on the AIRS list last
week. She stopped by and we thought we had fixed her brake
challenge, but now, I get this email and she is too far out for me
to be able to rescue. Anyone out there that can help? Karolyn can
be emailed at ---@---.--- Thanks, a ton, in advance - <font color=

<p>Heres what she wrote me: Hey there, Greg! Well, bad news. We are
stuck on the side of the road down here in Middletown, CA (just
under Clear Lake) with a horribly bad caliper. It burned up and now
we're in a place that apparently has almost NO resources. Do you
know anyone in these parts who would know a thing or two about VWs?
I was trying to get towed to Santa Rosa, but AAA will only tow me 5
miles. :P Thanks! :) <font color="#800000">Karolyn</font></p>

<p>Thanks for all your help! just got back from my trip, i've got a
ton of digests to read! I just drove from boston,MA to london,
Ontario and back for my cousins wedding. Just outside Rochester my
generator bearings gave way...a terrible racket and generator light
ensued...i was too worried about the pulley exploding given the off
balance of the bearings to continue driving...anyway a quick call
to Ronnie at old volks-who I guess posted to the list, and also
provided me with a list of names from the AIRS site...I called
about ten names before I got through to Dave and Hilda Dionne
outside Buffalo in West Seneca. DAve was working the night shift
and would not be home until 8am the next day. But I was more than
welcome to bring the bus there to work on it. I got a tow to his
house(94 miles) and arrived around 10:30 at night. His wife
-Hilda-welcomed me to their house, had dinner waiting, and a beer!
what hospitality. The next morning I got up early and started
getting ready to pull the engine to replace the generator-or pullit
so that the bearings could be replaced. Dave arrived shortly after
eight, and affter working all night proceeded to spend the better
part of the day helping me fully diagnose the problem, and find the
replacement parts-turned out the best option was to replace the
generator-but I had a 6V, most places were 7-10 days. Luckily due
to a call from an AIRS member whose name I cant remember*(sorry-see
note below) I got a place in Niagara-Johns bug shop. they could
have the generator in a day (friday night) unfortunately the
wedding ceremonies were starting thursday night. so I rented a car,
left my bus in Daves driveway, went to canada for the weekend,
picked up my generator monday morning, and Dave helped me install
it that day. got back on the road, and returned to my cousins up on
Lake Huron for the week. my family and friends were all incredulous
at the story of the help I received from the list. I on the other
hand was quite proud to be a member of such a great community. I
only hope that I may one day return the favor to another member.
*The names of all who offered to help is long. After word got out
to the list, I was hit with many calls of aid. Unfortunately as it
was all happening so fast I can not remember everyone's name that I
spoke with. But THANK YOU all for your help.</p>

<p><font color="#800000">George Lyle</font> responded: This is the
reaction that I got from my friends where I was broken down in
Utah. An email to the list produced in short order the information
I needed and a nearby source for the part (on a sunday in utah) as
well as offers of direct assistance. My friends, who assumed that
the lists and AIRS was something like AAA, asked "How much do you
have to pay for that service?" :) Remember folks, the thing that
makes the list so valuable is the listees. We all get an
opportunity to lend a hand now and then, even if it is just a ride
to the parts store, so when that opportunity comes to you jump to
it!</p>

<p>Well the AIRS list came through for Kevin. I gave him a bunch of
names in the NY area and one nice bus owner offered his help and
driveway. Kevin is now in Buffalo, NY with his engine out looking
for a small diameter 6 volt generator without the regulator mounted
on top.</p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Times New Roman" size=

dropped by to camp last night, in a very clean '71 westfakia. They
told me their engine nightmares that I thought I would share with
the list. First of all, a beetlemex engine that broke a camshaft
after only 10k miles (in Roswell, maybe it was the aliens). They
are very disappointed that the beetlemex crapped out just after the
warranty period. The guy who fixed it for them just put in a new
cam, somehow they had metal shavings that ate up the rest somewhere
in Texas. A German mechanic rebuilt everything properly but they
apparently were running super hot (~260 oil temp) on the breakin.
Properly timed 009 dist. because his vac advance is worn-out, I
offered him one out of a few that I have but the numbers don't
match (we will look on the dizzy site). Only other thing I can
think of is lean running, from vac leak or mixture. Anyhow they are
looking for a stock bus muffler in Atlanta today, and will leave
tomorrow to go to Chattanooga, the Smokies, Asheville, and on to
Quebec and return to CA eventually. Nice volks.</font></font></p>

<p>Hi Volks, Dave is now back under way; he just called me from
upper NY state. They tapped the hole and put a bolt in with LOTS of
loctite and got rolling by 2:30 PM. He stopped in for a visit at
AIRS-member Dave Wolfganger; DW had fresh cookies waiting and gave
Dave a tour of his impressive stash of air-cooled goodies. I'll
leave that story to Dave when he gets back. Thanks to all who
emailed their concern and advice. AIRS is really a special thing to
bus ownership and today I'm especially proud to be on the roster.
Happy trails indeed,</p>

<p>I have to tell you about the best AIRS rescue ever! On the way
to Everybus 2002 I had noticed a little "thump thump" noise from
one of my rear tires. I thought that I had a lump or "mud in my
tires". Got to EB02 and had an awesome time. Left northbound with
the Jeff Stewart/Canadian carabus. All is well until just south of
Lynchburg when I notice that the thump is now big vibrations at
lower speeds. We stop to take a look at it and decide that if I
baby it and keep at higher speeds I should make it to Round Hill
where we can all take a look at her. The Loveboat decides
otherwise. 10 miles later, just north of Lynchburg, I realize that
I have to pull over NOW. Took next exit and into a church parking
lot with the left rear tire having a very pronounced wobble.
Bearings are shot. Pulled out the AIRS list that I had printed just
before my trip south and found that Jeff Burks was the closest (at
over an hour away). I left him a message and he returned my call in
less than 5 minutes. He had a brother within 15 minutes! Better
yet, his brother has a fully loaded garage and is a parts
supplier!!! We take a quick poll of what to do and some of the
other drivers offer to stay with me. Then Jeff's brother Ron comes
pulling up in his Westy! We all feel relieved that I am in good
hands and the carabus leaves. I hobble at less than 10 miles an
hour to Ron's shop (about 5 miles away). Take her apart with Ron's
awesome air tools. Inner/outer bearings, seals and a new wheel hub
are in order. I have a set. The Canadians had given me a set of
bearings that turned out to be for a front wheel,dammit. Jeff shows
up and we sit down to a wonderful dinner and decide what to do. Ron
worked the phones to his distributor buddies and we found that
nobody stocks the outer bearings. Plan B - Make calls in the
morning after we sleep on it. Jeff and his wife drove me the 1 hour
plus trip to Roanoke where they put me up for the night in his
Westy. Slept like a baby. Came in for a cup of coffee and started
making calls. Jeff took the day off to help me! No bearings in all
of Virginia it appea! rs. Made a call to Salem Imports where Mark
said he had the whole assembly, used. Back in business. Had lunch
and went to check out Mark's shop. This was awesome in it's own
right! I wanted to move in on the spot. If you ever need any part
for any classic VW this is the place to go. Knowlegeable, friendly,
fair and tons of parts. We struck our very fair deal and headed
back to Lynchburg. Pulled off the old assy and discover a problem.
I got the wrong part. It didn't occur to any of us to make sure I
got a left assy. Oops. Back to Salem Import. Part is waiting. Back
to Lynchburg. Keep in mind that it is an hour plus each way and I
am relying on the kindness of a stranger that shares an interest.
The brotherhood of busses! Got the part installed well into the
night and I was back up and running. Jeff and his brother went
waaaay out of their way to help a busted brother. I cannot tell you
the gratitude I feel for he and his families southern hospitality
they have shown. If there is an award for the best AIRS rescue ever
I would like to nominate Jeff Burks for all the help he has given
to me.</p>

<p>Last Feb. I was moving from one side of the country to another
in my bus.As I was cruising through N.M./AZ my bus started running
like crap and I was tired so when I got to Tucson I called up an
A.I.R.S. member by the name of Gary and he said I could come over
and check the timing and whatnot.So I made it there and met him and
his friend had some conversation and set the timing noticed the
distributor clamp would not hold.So I got a new one down the road
later on.While working on the bus the plug thing on the carb flew
off ,spent some time looking no luck started fileing down a dime to
stick in there,then found the plug under/on the bumper.He was nice
enough to offer a place to sleep but I went out in the desert on a
recommended spot by him.It was awesome.Thanks again for the
help/rest stop.</p>

<p>Last night I got a call from Lloyd Elliot and his son. They were
on their way back to Bezerkley in the son's '71 Dormobile, when
they started hearing a strange noise. I went out there, and found
them easily enough, but had to peform a daring "wrong way on the
off-ramp" manuever to get to them. I had him fire it up, but
unfortunately, he didn't need a mechanic at this point - he needed
a priest. This poor thing has a serious rod knock which sounds like
it's going to go any second. There wasn't anything I coudl do, but
I did hang out for a while and check out the bus, which is probably
the only bay I would have ever considered owning. I haven't heard
back from them, but AAA was going to be giving them a ride
home.</p>

<p>Howdy Y'all, I got my first A.IR.S. call today. Guy named Ira
Bernstein who is travelling from Houston, Texas to Brooklyn New
York with his daughter Shelly calls me from Cincinnati and he is
having trouble with his 74 Beetle. (He called home and had his wife
search the internet for local help, and she found the A.I.R.S. List
on type2.com and gave him my number.) Anyway, Ira's Beetle is
cutting out and running rough and losing power. So I persuade him
to try to stagger to my place, which he does. I discover 1)His fuel
filter is Black from dirt, clogged up big time. He said he had the
car for 11 years and had never changed it! While changing the
filter, his fuel lines literally crumbled in my fingers. So we set
him up with a new hose. and 2) The idle jet cutoff on his carb has
vibrated loose. We got everything in order and he tried it out and
said it felt fine. Anyway, the two are travelling up I-71 to
Cleveland tonight, then straight across Pennsylvania on I-80
tomorrow into Jersey ! ! and then home in New York. We printed off
the list of all the AIRS members along the way, so if you get a
call from these guys, please try to help them out, they are very
nice folks. Peace,</p>

<p>Mr and Mrs. Dave Luppy, who requested A.I.R.S. assistance when
their 74 Bus broke down this week while on their honeymoon,
traveling from Manhattan and heading to St. Louis and Seattle. Mr.
and Mrs. Dave Luppy are on their way. They were towed to a second
garage, one that actually works on Bolts, and had the broken
halfshaft removed and brought it to me for examination. We found
the new inner cv had come apart, and the cage was cracked but not
broken. The problem was the cv joint had virtually no articulation,
like as if it were incorrectly assembled, but the fact is it is a
poor quality aftermarket part. it had also slightly damaged the end
of the shaft when the balls dropped out, and the inner race was
damaged. We rejected the failed part and he is replacing both
halfshafts with good used, cleaned, greased, original Lobro
halfshafts, and should be good for another million miles.He will be
installing them himself tomorrow morning. Mrs. Luppy has examined
her prenuptial agreement and acknowledges that the party of the
first part has used up a significant portion of allowable roadside
repair time, but took the afternoon in stride, and was quite
interested in discussions of project vehicles and technical
ramblings. They are heading for St. Louis and Seattle. Happy
Honeymoon, Dave and Dasha.</p>

<p>Well, it isnt that great of a story, but still feels good. I had
to run down to the town about 40 miles south of me to pick up my
daughters 18th birthday present we had made. I was in quite a hurry
because I had 3 things to attend to that afternoon, so I was
booking down the interstate at a pretty good clip. I just happen to
look over in the ditch and saw a dark colored bug sitting in the
grass with both ends of the car up. He had parked it in the shade,
so it kinda blended in, so by the time it registered, I had gone a
football field length passed him. I got off the road and back up
all the way. Im in my Nissan truck with a topper, so im sure he
wondered WHO this fool was and what kind of trouble he could bring.
One good thing is, I have a large SEVWC club logo on the back, so
as I got closer, atleast he could see I wasnt going to be TOO
strange of a person. He was on his way to Mobil Alabama, so it was
atleast another 400 mile ride for him. Come to find out, his fuel
pump was bad. Even though I drive a Nissan truck, I always carry a
good bit of VW stuff just incase, plus tools, etc. The bad thing
was, I was about in the middle of anyplace I knew where to get a
pump from. I told him we could tow the car to the next exit about 5
miles away and maybe there would be a mechanic place there, so off
we went. Never towed a car on the interstate, so that was a little
scary. Bad thing was, I always carry my bug towbar, but this was a
superbeetle. We get to the exit and there are about 5 gas stations,
a large antique store and a nudie bar. None of the gas stations had
service bays, the antique store didnt have any antique VW stuff and
the nudie bar....well, I dont think what was inside would have been
of any help. I told him I had to leave, but I would get a pump from
home and be back in a few hours after I tended to a few things.
Atleast he wasnt sitting on the side of the interstate with nothing
but cars zooming past like rockets. I gave him my card and told him
to call me IF anyone happend to come by with a pump. I was about 2
miles from the house and on my way to meet him when my cell phone
rang. He had called the house and got a pump from someone, so my
daughter called me to let me know. Now I have added a fuel pump to
my parts I carry in the Nissan....just incase :)</p>

<p>My first AIRS call! After work Monday night the phone rings and
I hear from Nick and Jason; two college kids from Nebraska. They're
here in Cooperstown with a brake problem on a white over red '71
bus. Nick was familiar with the list, (had met Isiah in Wisconson
and someone else up in Portland, Maine) but wasn't a member of
AIRS. (Promised he will sign up after his trip.) Just like AIRS is
supposed to work, I tell'em to come on over and we take a look at
it. Blown, leaking wheel left rear wheel brake cylinder - one of
them had already diagnosed it and gotten the part - so we spent the
evening setting up in the driveway and pulling and replacing the
cylinder. Only the usual trouble with drum brakes, no catastrophes.
Got some takeout food, and they slept in their bus and my bus in
the driveway, had breakfast and lunch here and visited our local
museum and then were on there way, towards NYC. They're traveling
around the country and I hope you get a chance to met them. My
thanks (and their's too) for Wade and Charlie and all the other
AIRS volks.</p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">This story is a bit old but with out
it I would not be the person I am today. For many years I had
dreamed about crossing Canada in a Volkswagen van and after I
finished university I finally had the time to do it. Its a long
way(over 6000 miles there, let alone back) and I had been working
on 'Huck' as best as my budget would allow to get her ready for the
trip. I covered most of the maintanence stuff but I did not have
time to look at the larger components. Alternator, Starter, Engine
and Transmission. The first time I stopped for gas, the starter
started going. Arghh! Never a problem before. But this trip was
meant to be and after a dealer stop I was off again. Continued all
the way to Newfoundland with another stop for an alternator in
Halifax (luckily I had a good battery to get me there). But the
trip back would be my challenge. After driving for 16 hours through
the Northeast US at an unhealthy speed of 75 mph I pulled in at my
relatives in the Toronto area. The next day I was eager to get back
on the road as I had (I thought) a job lined up for labour day. It
was not meant to be. About 60 miles out of Toronto I ran out of
gas.A common problem since the gas gauge didn't work but I always
had a big jerry can ready. So no problem there but as I pulled out
again and put her through the gears I heard a loud crack/clunk as I
put it in fourth. After looking around her on the roadside (did not
even realize that fourth was gonzo) I started it up again and came
to the horrific realization that I was 3500 miles from home with a
bad tranny. I can't help but think that all that driving at 75mph
killed it. Anyhow, I limped back to Toronto and hopped on the
internet, being familar with the list (this is before AIRS). Den,
now an AIRS member, replied to my plea for a tranny in the area and
it turns out that he was only about an hour away. By this time
though I only had 3rd and by the time I got there I only had 1st
gear left. After that, what can I say. Den was the best, having the
space that I could only dream of, he found a spare tranny that he
thought would work (a bit shorter from an earlier bus) installed it
for me for a small fee. I had been despairing that I might have to
abandon the car but I made it all the way home driving over 10
hours a day. The tranny never failed (though the body did a year
and a half later and sadly this bus became a donor). I think of
this as I am buying my second bus, now with the change in my pocket
to restore it.</font></p>

<p>This morning I got a call from a Karen who was driving from
Oakland California to meet friends in Austin Nevada. Seems that
Karens VW Bus had a seized generator and she got my name off the
AIRS list. All I could do was give her a couple of phone numbers to
the 'good' repair shops in town. I think just having a friendly
voice on the other end of the phone helped quite a bit as she
called me a couple hours later to thank me. Seems the shop changed
the generator in quick time and charged her a fair amount($194$).
Off she went without ruining her holiday weekend. I have had the
pleasure of helping three VW Bus strangers in the last year who got
my name off the AIRS list, once for a lady going back east with an
unknown Bus and just wanting to know how it sounded to 'an
experienced Bus owner', a couple of weeks ago, I helped with a guy
named Mick from Aspen Colorado on his way to SF with a engine
concern. Let him stay on my property and lent him tools which he
returned when done (I was already at work). The interesting about
all three AIRS events with me was ........They were all Bay Window
Busses..... Maybe the Split Busses - which so many people are
afraid to take on a long trip without a trailer full of spare
parts- are the more reliable VW Bus. Anyways, there hasn't been
much discussion of list members experiences from AIRS related
emergency's. So what say ye...</p>

<hr>
<p>So I get home a little after 5 from work on Saturday. A friend
of mine says that some guys called from Green Bay saying they had
my name off of the internet <font color="#800000">(AIRS)</font> and
had some questions regarding their bus. This got me curious, and
the number on the caller ID just came up as unavailable.. dern. I
check my email and a couple minutes after that I get a phone call
from these guys. They had come to town and were at the place where
I work as my friend told them I was at work still when they called
before. They said they had a 71 bus and it was leaking some oil and
running a little rough. Thats about all they got out before I said
"be there in 10 minutes" I was there 10 minutes later loaded with
tools even (took some home from work that night knowing i was going
to work on the 62) They introduce themselves and we pull the bus
around back and get crackin. The bus was running a little rough and
not idling just right. I poppled off the dist cap and noticed by
looking at the points that they were not gapped enough. A .016
feeler gauge and screwdriver later the engine was running like a
top. Now for the oil leak. They said they were going through about
a quart a day, but they were also driving 400 miles a day. Thats a
good bit of oil to go through. Upon further inspection it looks as
if its coming from behind the crank pulley. Not too much I could do
about it, but I said switch to a thicker oil and that could help
out a bit. They'll do that tomorrow or the next day they say. So we
get to talking and I asked if they needed a place to stay or
something. They accepted. We hopped on over to my house and they
were looking at the 62 in the garage as I went in and got some loot
and clothes and what not. We went and picked up a fuel filter, then
headed over to our shop (a few guys in town have a private shop
where we store/work on cars, get together, just hang around etc) We
drove around a bit and I showed them the town and we went and
picked up some beverages for the night. Got back to the shop and
started talking some more and doing a bit of drumming (hand drums
are also made at the shop)... We talked about their travels and
their plans and what brought them to get a bus. Well, they're two
college guys from Nebraska who wanted to go on a trip for the
summer as they had been taking trips up to canada, colorado,
montana etc in a "normal" car just for fun. They wanted to make a
big trip out of it and decided to buy a bus for the occasion. They
picked a *nice* bus! Its a red/white 71 bus with a moderate amount
of gear in it. It has a nice engine and the nicest looking
underside I've seen on a bus in a long time. They got it for a real
good price and put an alternator on the engine and did a few other
things before they left on the trip. They had been on the road for
a week. So we pulled the buses around the back of the shop and set
up. They moved their stuff around so they could sleep in the bus,
and I pulled out the bed in my bus and decided to camp there for
the night. It was a beautiful night for sleeping. We went back in
and did a bit of drumming and got to talking some more. There were
a couple of other minor things they wanted me to look at, so we
agreed to take care of it in the morning... So a handfull of bottle
caps later we went to bed. Got up in the morning sweating (sleeping
bag with the sun beating down on me, i hate that) and decided to
head home for a bit to take a shower. We headed back to my place
and everyone cleaned up, then we headed around town and met a few
of the local bus nuts, picked up some grub, and back to the shop. I
crawl under the bus just looking around and notice the backing
plate on the right rear is wet on the bottom. Uh oh me says. I jack
up the bus and pull of the drum and sure enough, its soaked. Real
leaky wheel cylinder. Hmmm, called up the parts places in town that
were open, and nobody can get one until Tuesday. I called up a few
of the local bus guys and nobody has a new one on hand. So I figure
that a used good one is better than a leaky one. I pulled one off
of a backing plate I had (67 even) and went back over to the shop,
but not before stopping and picking up some miracle-in-a-can. Some
of you refer to it as brake parts cleaner. Personally, I worship
the stuff. The good stuff that is. Anyways, we get back, and I tear
into it and replace it. Then we bleed the brakes, use the brakes
some, and tear off the drum again to verify it isn't leaking. No
leaks, good news. Spray the shoes down with the brake parts
cleaner, and rough em up with some sandpaper and all is well. After
thats all done we head on over the the engine. It seemed as if it
were running a bit rich, so I adjusted the carb per the Bentley
manual. It seemed to help a bit. Checked over the engine, checked
the timing, etc. I also put hose clamps on every fuel line
connection (they were missing a couple) and also put a safety wire
on the fuel inlet to the carb. I've had this come out on me before.
It is *not* fun. We cooked up some burgers in the mean time, talked
some more, drove around a bit more, and checked out each others
buses. I took some pictures even. All too soon they were on their
way out. They were headed to Milwaukee, then Chicago, and who knows
where from there. They've just been staying at campground, wal mart
parking lots, etc and loving every bit of it. They have to be back
to school the 24th of August and they plan to travel until whenever
they feel like stopping. They're headed to the east coast and just
taking their time and taking everything in. I believe they even
posted to the list before they left when they got the bus. I'm not
sure though as I haven't been up on all the posts (T2 list) as of
late. Nick and Jason are their names. If these guys call on you, or
you see them in their bus, by all means stop and say hi. They're
great guys. I wish I got more calls like this from the AIRS list.
Once we got to talking it was like we were old friends. I could
have left $500 cash on the table and left them when I went to the
gas station or something and been completely comfortable with it.
These are good and honest guys just out looking to have some fun.
Oh yeah, they needed some tunes for their bus, so we gave em a
radio and some speakers. They've just been enjoying the hum of the
engine till now enjoying the sights and sounds and just going
wherever they feel :) It was tempting to pack up ol Stella and join
in on the trip! But, obviously I didn't. I (and I'm sure many
others!) would love to do something like this. These guys are
actually doing it. They've got a good bus to go with, and the best
of intentions. These are new VW owners, but they went over the bus
pretty well before they left, and havea pretty good basic
understanding of things. They carried a few spare parts (I donated
a clutch cable to the cause as they were without one) and tools so
they've the right idea! When I came home from work I had nothing
but a boring weekend face. After this my weekend we well spent.
Thanks for the company guys, and I wish you the best of luck on
your trip!! Sorry if any of this was rambling :) <font color=

on the guys that stopped by here a week or so ago from Nebraska.
They and they're 71 bus are in New York today and should be to
Maine during the day some time. They're doing well and haven't had
any more problems, but they say something is rattling in back,
probably engine tin or something of the like. Does anyone have a
list of shows coming up on the east coast? Anywhere from Maine down
to Florida. I'd like to get these guys a list as they were wanting
to attend some shows/campouts while on their trip.

<p>Well my wife and I just got back from our first ever long trip
in our yellow 74 westy. We traveled from our home in Atmore,
Alabama to Maryville TN to take our daughter back to college. 1109
total miles. We carried our AIRS list for the states of Alabama,
Georgia, and Tennessee with us, but we didn't need to use it. We
left last Thursday morning, and returned home this afternoon,
Tuesday, August 29, 2000. I was devastated to read the news about
Kristin when I caught up on my type 2 reading. Sunday, on our way
back home, we had an encounter with a vehicle that was quite a bit
larger than us, and it kind of put a damper on our spirits that
day. We also had trouble that evening locating a campground. Up
until that point we had stayed in three very nice campgrounds, but
I never once considered calling on an AIRS list person. Instead, we
stayed in a motel. In the future, I may decide to call on an AIRS
list person. I know that I will be far more open to the idea of
someone camping in my pasture now than I was before this trip. I am
also going to carry far better campsite locating documents than a
map with a green tent by a city name.</p>

to turn freely on them and they where about to loose their only fan

have worked for the drive ahead of them. The Guys name was Chad,
forgot the young girls name. This is a couple that David at Bug

I doubt it, if you have any info on them making it to their

<p><font color="#800000">Heres a message from the type2 list a
while back, sent out to get others opinions on a motorist in
trouble:</font> Kristin, traveling on a deadline toward CA just
called me about 70 miles outside Memphis. Please read through this
note and see what you think. She's had a string of bad luck and now
is fighting a "bucking" bus on the way in. Here's what she
described to me: Her '71 DP bus is basically bucking between gears.
She says when she shifts, she feels like the bus is pulling back on
her. She said the bus has basically no power, but she also told me
that she's able to make speeds of 50-60...so there's *some* power
there. I'm actually thinking fuel delivery as in fuel pump, but I
could be wrong here. Hope I'm right, as I'm pretty sure I have a
spare fuel pump for a '71. Here is some of the other info I got
from her: She had a bad mechanic experience where dude didn't
tighten the flywheel right and it flew off into the bellhousing,
chewing tranny. She managed to get it to another mechanic who
pulled the motor and made things right. 2nd mechanic had to turn
the idle screw on her 34pict3 all the way in to get the bus to run,
but I guess he thought some of the problem would just work itself
out and let her go on her way, emploring her to take it easy.
Funny, he pulled a 30pict off because he thought that was why she
had no power. Maybe mechanic #2 missed something too, but at least
he did her right as far as flywheel fix at a reasonable (what she
could afford) rate. Obviously, the details I'm getting just before
midnight here are a little sketchy, but I told her to come by early
and I'll try to help her before work. Any ideas would be
appreciated. Remember, the main symptom is bucking on the highway,
especially between shifts. She also mentioned that she's having to
lift the gas pedal up with her foot to reduce RPMs in traffic,
which I'm wondering about. Could this have something to do with the
brake booster and possibly a messed up diaphram in that? Thanks!
Joe PS. If you're between TN and CA (I-40ish, I presume) and you
want to leave contact info (city and phone number) for her, I'll
pass it on just in case.</p>

working and i get a call from a guy named john. he tells me that
he's broken down in nashville on hwy 65 and 40. he said he needed a
fuel pump for his girlfriend's 74 bay. i told him that i didn't
think i had a baywindow one, but we could take a look if he wanted
to crash in my driveway. he did so. i got home from work at around
10:00p to find john and his buddy (sorry, i forgot your name)
hangin' out in the bay. to make a short story long, we looked
through my stuff and found a fuel pump off of my old motor. we
compared the top halves of both pumps (which was really the only
part he needed) and they looked darn close. so john did the swap
and it was a successful swap. i think he is going to put a brand
new fuel pump on there asap just to be safe. so all was well. i met
some very cool vw friends, had some good vw talk, and had one vw in
and out of my driveway and john on his way. john (better known as
<a href="mailto:volknut@1st.net">volknut@1st.net</a>) is a list
member which made the experience all that much cooler. john makes

type2 blues for a couple of months (fuel injection problems, I
thought). I contacted Mr. Thompson from the AIRS list (<font color=
"#800000">Todd had 'coffee/talk' marked on his info</font>)and told
him my problems. He listened with asympathetic ear and gave very
good advice. He is very easy going and helpful and we decided that
I needed an engine. Since my bus wouldn't survive a trip to the
junkyard for our quest, he drove me around for several hours on a
Sunday. He went way beyond the call of duty for a virtual stranger.
It is heartwarming to know that there is someone like him that will
extend himself in such a fashion. I would like to thank the AIRS
group and a special "shout-out" to Todd Thompson! Happy trails,</p>

days? Odd, considering I havent gotten but one call and a visit
from the Millars since the inception (<font color="#800000">of
AIRS</font>). Is it VW migration season? <font color=
"#800000">1</font>) Got a call from some young travelers from New
York staying on South Beach. Went visiting on sunday, 71 westy
engine sounds a bit rough, like 3 cyl firing rough :(. They saw a
mechanic today who said 'rebuild 1100$' so tomorrow they are off
for a 2nd opinion from a pretty highly regarded shop and well see
how it goes. I have to be wary of a mechanic saying rebuild 1100$
without suggesting a new engine possibility pr explaining why in
some detail. <font color="#800000">2</font>) A pleasant girl with
an 83 who is preparing for a trip to new hampshire? and just wanted
reassurance that things seem cool before she takes off.
<font color="#800000">3</font>) Just a few minutes ago some
travellers in a 69 heading for key west just asking about the area
and crashing spots. May drop by on the way back through (to
Savannah) for a visit. I guess like the Mortons salt slogan "When
it rains, It pours."</p>

<p><font color="#800000">&gt;&gt;&gt;</font>....Pulled out of
Lenoir a little early, had plans to meet some folks before I got to
Snoopy's. The Express was grumbling along making all the right
noises as we ran the usual route down I77 between Charlotte &amp;
Columbus. All of a sudden she started missing and backfiring,
losing power, then quit completely. The oil pressure was up as long
as she was turning over so I didn't think we'd suffered internal
engine damage. Rolled to the side of the road, broke out the barely
adequate tool kit and VOM to see what the problem might be. Oil
level was fine, and I couldn't help but notice the absence of a
large gaping hole in the engine case. There was fuel in the filter,
a squirt could be heard going into the carbs when I tickled the
throttle. Hmmm. Just for fun, tried her again and she started right
up. No sense sitting along the side of the road with the rigs and
a$$*)!@s er SUV drivers blowing by at 80+. She was still backfiring
and making almost no power but we managed the 1/4 mile to the
nearest exit. Power to the coil, the signal from the Pertronix
didn't follow the pattern points usually show. Must be the igniter
went bad. No problem, put in the extra dizzy with the points.
Always carry stuff like that. Open the spare bus locker and find
the extra dizzy. No points! &lt;insert unkind word here&gt; That's
right, helped someone else out, gave them the spares, never
replaced them. &lt;another unkind word&gt; There's nothing at this
exit but litter. The whole time I was there, nobody took it from
either direction. Probably 1 of those great ideas some politician
had - growth opportunity for Bubbaville. Fortunately, I had John's
phone #. Just looked, he's not on the AIRS list, but I am so this
IS an AIRS story. Called John, he was more than willing to help. He
left his house drove almost 40 miles with 2 kids that weren't his
(they had company), and brought me a set of points. While I was
waiting, pulled the dizzy, then sat and played my guitar for a
while. John showed up, in no time dizzy was back in and timed. the
BIG MOMENT was here! Turn the key, she starts right up idles just
fine. Big grin and thumbs up ease her into gear and KABLAM BOOMITY
POP POP she's backfiring again. &lt;yet another unkind word&gt;.
Doublecheck gap and timing, both are spot on. Hmmm. Random firing,
if not timing, must be the coil. But coils &gt;never&lt; go bad.
But wait, I had one go bad after High Country Bus fest a couple
years ago. Pull the coil, put the meter across it, infinite
resistance across the primary side. &lt;even more unkind words&gt;
John smiled, said get in lets go get a coil. We drove a long time
before we saw any civilization. The parts store in town was closed.
No problem sez he, we'll get the coil off my bus. So we went chez
John and Anna, get to see the imaginary bus - yes, the Terrapin
Flier is real! John pulls the coil, back in the car, and off we go
back to the Express. Install coil, she fires right up, running
great. John follows me to his exit and off he goes. Didn't tell me
my taillights were out but the really nice South Carolina State
Trooper did. So did the not so nice one later on. But that's a
different tale.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">&gt;&gt;&gt;</font>...On Sat. nite about
10:30 the phone rang. A young woman quickly introduced herself and
told me that she had my name from the AIRS list. She and her
boyfriend had just purchased a bus (1967 Westy)that day in northern
Va. and were on their way home to FL. After they stopped in
Greensboro for gas they could not get the bus to go into gear.
After playing twenty questions I gave them my address and told them
they could have it towed to my house and we would have a look in
the morning. They arrived about midnight and we chatted about this
and that and decided that perhaps there was a failure of the clutch
or perhaps the throw out bearing fork. This was their first bus and
they had it for less the 5 hours and did not know a lot about VWs.
We all know how much I know :) In the morning I called LBC member
Chad Sibert and asked him if we could borrow a clutch off of junk
motor and he was more then happy to do so. After picking up the
clutch we proceeded with motor pulling 101. After everything was
disconnected and the motor was hanging by the studs , LBC member
John Stainkamp roared up in the driveway in his 61 DC. Whenever
John pulls up I feel like the calvary has arrived :) We pulled the
motor but much to our chagrin the clutch, fork and all related
parts were fine. The owner of the bus jumped in and tried to put it
through the gears. Many loud clunks were heard. Uh oh! The plug was
removed from the tranny. The magnetic plug was covered in bright
shavings and the tranny only yielded a cup full of brown goo. The
axle boots were in bad shape but there was no major evidence of
gear oil all over the place. The tranny had been dry for some time.
LBC member Roy Nilsen was summoned to obtain the only gallon of
Stalube GL4 that was to be found on a Sunday morning. We hoped in
vain that by filling the tranny back up it might help unstick
itself. We also fussed endlessly with a stupid Hurst shifter that
had no doubt been installed by the same idiot that painted the dash
and the steering wheel brown. The bus would not come out of third
gear. We gave it everything we had. Sadly the bus left the same way
it came - on the back of a tow truck. I am sorry that we could not
fix the bus but I am glad that we were able to try. Thanks to John,
Chad and Roy for putting up a good fight and spending a day trying
to help some strangers in a bus make it home. They truly
appreciated it! --</p>

past Monday night. I received a call from a guy who had printed out
the AIRS list to take with him on his trip. He was looking for a
safe place to park for the night.. told him he could park in my
driveway, gave him directions and in just a bit he was here.. He is
driving from California to eventually Alabama, just taking the back
roads and siteseeing. He came in... borrowed the stove and cooked
his dinner and then retired for the night in his '71VW bus.... and
the next morning had breakfast with us and then was on his way. Not
too sure which way he was going. but was headed kind of south to
start with... His name is Kent... he is a really nice guy and hoped
to be calling on more list members during his travels. Was glad to
be able to offer a place to stay,</p>

The AIRS list saved my butt on the way home. I had a rear wheel

Airs list and called a fellow named Jason in Va. Beach. He let me
leave my beloved (DHARMA) at his house until I could return to get
it with a trailer. I could have fixed it there, but I had to be
back to work at 2:00 am Tues. morning. A great big thank you to him

<p><font color="#FF0000">&gt;&gt;&gt;</font>...I got a call Sunday
afternoon from a Gentleman on the coast of NC, referred to me by G.
Marv Krupp from the call to him placed by the aforementioned
Gentleman originating from the A.I.R.S. List. Got it? His daughters
79 Westfalia had ceased operation at Brevard College. It is her
first semester in a new town and they were unfamiliar with the
territory, both mechanical and geographic. The Gentleman I think
misunderstood the nature of A.I.R.S., and seemed to think that we
are a list of mechanics for hire. I had to repeatedly refuse both
his and his daughters offers of money. He found us surfing via the
Type 2 site. They are not members and apparently had no knowledge
of this entire subterranean vista. Anyway, a bus was in need, so my
wife (after some sharp trading, I had to agree to vacuum after we
got back) and I loaded up in the A***a to check it out. When I got
there she wanted to give me the keys so I could tow it away. I
smiled but I did not laugh out loud. She is a very nice girl, and
helped me open it up for an inspection. She cranked it up and it
ran very roughly. First thing, I checked the points and they were
burned moderately, at least enough to run as badly as I had
observed. I showed them to her and asked if she had another set. I
thought for sure that all busses had a spare, but not hers. I carry
a set even though I have the Pertronix, cause, well, you never
know. So we offered her a ride to the parts store. This was a SMART
girl. She immediately begged off to go call her Dad. It took me a
moment to figure out what was going on, until my wife clued me
in.... NEVER GET IN THE CAR WITH A STRANGER! So my wife and I went
to the parts store while the girl was calling and bought the last
set of points in stock. I didn't have a timing light with me so I
bought a cheap feeler gauge and by the time we got back she was
waiting at the bus. I put the points in and she started it but
absolutely no improvement. I fiddled with the points but no luck.
Then I noticed that the idle air bypass valve supply hose from the
air intake boot to the valve had a cracked and broken elbow at the
valve, leaving the hose to hang free. That's a lot of air to bypass
the AFM. Then out of curiosity I checked the oil. The bottom of the
dipstick was definitely wet, and if I had to guess I would say that
she was at least three quarts low. I asked the girl if she had ever
checked the oil. She said that she knew it was probably low. Hmmm,
I asked her if the oil light had ever come on. She said yes, it
came on during the eight hour trip up to school two weeks ago, but
it went out after a while, so she didn't stop. At this point my
wife volunteered that while I had my head in the engine compartment
holding the throttle to keep it running it was blowing voluminous
clouds of smoke. I asked her what colour and she said, dark.
Driving a bus should be a carefully considered and educated
decision. I have referred the girl and her father to our local ASE
Master Mechanic. In retrospect, I see it could have been much worse
for her, and I am very very very grateful that I had the
opportunity to help.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">&gt;&gt;&gt;</font>I want to let everyone,
especially AIRS members, know that Kathy and I successfully made
our round trip to Michigan and back to Long Island, New York this
past week. Even though I didn't have to call any AIRS members for
help, it sure was a nice to know I could if I had to. Thank you to
all AIRS members, where ever you are. Our 71 westy ran fine for a
little over 2000 miles this past week. We did experience the hot
start problem a few times, so the starter will be coming out soon
for a good cleaning and inspection. One morning the engine shut
down just a few minutes after starting. It was sudden, just as if
it was shut off. Seemed like an electrical problem to me, so I
opened the distributor cap and had a look see. Everything was OK,
so I closed it up, checked for spark and got a good hot one, then
tried to start it back up. It started on the first try and ran fine
the rest of the time since. Gas mileage was 23.7 mpg, and I did
have to add 1/2 a quart of oil during the trip. I guess the biggest
problem we had is that the plumbing for the sink drain started
leaking in the cabinet and got the surrounding floor wet. Most of
the driving to get to Michigan and back was on hiways 80, 23, and
75. As you can guess, we were the slowest thing on the roads. Most
other drivers seemed to just go past us and on their way. In
western PA we did have one New York driver lay on the horn as he
followed very close behind us and then passed, but even more people
gave us a smile and a wave. Of course as we were driving around
lower Michigan for a week many young people pointed and waved as we
drove by. I'm sure some of them had never seen a bus before. One
young lady had a real laugh as she checked us into a camp ground.
Part of the paper work asked for vehicle make, model and year. When
she asked for the year I said I thought the bus was older than her
and asked what year she was born. Her reply was "85". When I told
her the VW came out of the factory in 71 we laughed for 5 minutes,
at least. I've got to say, that there seemed to be a real lack of
buses and a/c VW's in particular in and around Flint, MI. Yeah,
yeah, I know, MI is the capital of the US automotive industry.
While we were there we did get to meet John H. , list and AIRS
member. Of course since he too has a 71 westy we each had to
inspect the other guys bus. I sure wish I had his interior. Over a
cold beer our wives decided that there must be some common traits
in folks that want to own old VWs. They talked about making up a
questionaire for list members to find out what it is we all have in
common. Personally, I call it class! Also on this trip our bus
revealed it&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s name to us.
It&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s now called John Dear. You see, I just gave
it a quick coat of paint a few weeks ago, and the color was called
John Deere Green. So when you see us, don&#226;&#8364;&#8482;t
forget to ask how John is doing. All in all the trip was a great
success and adventure. This is the farthest
we&#226;&#8364;&#8482;ve ever been by bus and were prepared for all
sorts of problems. I&#226;&#8364;&#8482;m sure glad we
didn&#226;&#8364;&#8482;t have any.</p>

their dog, Butter) called me yesterday, about 5:30pm. I swiped a
pulley from a spare motor and took my dog with me, and found them
at the Quality Inn off of I-385 in Greenville. Installed the
pulley, tried to find a spare belt in my parts stash for them (I
think I gave my last one away), hung out for a few minutes, swapped
e-mail addresses... They are driving a purple '72 with an upright
in it, bought recently from a bug that had been sitting for awhile.
They are strapped for cash, and the engine compartment looks pretty
rough. I hope they make it, they need all the help they can get...
The crank pulley is pretty rough, and I'm sure it is shredding the
belt (evident by all the black rubber dust in the engine
compartment). I advised them to get a spare belt as soon as they
find a parts store open... Meredith, I have one of your
screwdrivers, that Chad found in his toolbox... Viva la Airs

came over Snoqualmie Pass last night in a downpour, and before he
reached the summit he lost his 1 [and only] wiper arm. Off his '62
Type 2. With safari windshields/windscreens. He was desperate to
find at least 1 replacement arm and blade so he could return to
Spokane tonight, over Snoqualmie Pass, in a downpour. My daughter
called all over the Tacoma area trying to track down the part,
without success. I discussed the situation with Shawn, covering all
possible scenarios including a large supply of RAIN-X. His friends
found a couple of leads up Seattle way, and Shawn was considering

bus. Arggh! No worry, I called a few folks off of the list, one of

and another (Fred Stoermer of Tacoma?) came just to see how things
went. They recommended Ovals Motor Sports of Federal Way. I had a

<hr>
<p><font color="#FF0000">&gt;&gt;&gt;</font>Just returned from a
little voyage from Clarksville TN to Fort Walton Beach FL.
Everything was going well until I got about 15 miles from Fort
Walton Beach. At that point in time (which was about 3:00 AM), the
little noise coming from the rear of the bus got really loud and
then went completely silent. The bus floated across the road a few
times before I managed to get her to slide to a stop on the
shoulder. When I got out to see what happened, I found that the
driver's side rear wheel had come completely off the vehicle. The
axle was shredded, cv joint sheared apart, breaks torn to pieces,
tire blown out, and the back of the bus was resting with the shocks
on the ground. My wife, a friend, two dogs, all of our luggage for
the 4-day weekend, and myself were now stuck on the side of the
road. Nobody we knew was home, all of the garages and tow trucks we
called we're still closed and no cab would come and pick all of us
up (would only pick up to two people and they weren't willing to do
it for the money I had). And then, the cell phone started dying.
So, we set out reflectors, popped the top, and went to sleep
thinking daylight would bring better news. Around 6:30 AM we were
still unable to get in touch with anybody (I spliced the cell-phone
power pack into the bus - ok, so the wife forgot to bring the
cigarette lighter adaptor, but wasn't going to make an issue of it
right there - You know). Finally, just before 7:00 AM, I turned to
the last resort and called AIRS volunteer Victor Cardona (HUGE
ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR MR. CARDONA). Victor was great. He came right
over and picked us all up, drove us all the way into Fort Walton
Beach over to my wife's friend's house, and even recommended a
great mechanic. Thank you so much Victor. So, we were finally able
to get the bus towed to Little Motors off of Highway 98 near
Hulbert Field owned and operated by Jeff (Huge plug for him - I'll
get all the specific data later when I get my other bag back -
another story). Jeff was closed for 4th of July, but came in on
Monday the 3rd since he knew we were from out of town and had to
get back to work, took an axle from another bus and had our Bess
running and ready to go by late Monday afternoon. Also, he got us
another tire because he wouldn't let us leave without having a
spare. So, he got another axle, fixed the breaks, new tire, and all
put it all together in perfect working order on his day off for
people from out of town and charged us less than $100 (We were
already trying to figure out which one of my organs we were going
to have to sell to pay for this). What a guy!!! Seriously, he did a
great job and helped us out of a very tough spot. Thank you so much
Mr. Cardona and Jeff from Little Motors. You guys are what makes
owning a VW so special. Also, having the weekend that we did (very
tough), it was great to see what great people are still out there.
Great for the soul! Thank You so much,</p>

from a couple traveling from Washington to Mexico. Their throw out
bearing disintegrated because the return spring on the tranny gave
out. They told me that some guy in San Francisco had given them a
print out of the AIRS list. They too had never heard of any of the

calling every place within about a 50 mile radius I ended up giving

my Texas road trip, I printed out the AIRS lists for each state I
was passing through (geographically, that is). At the time it was
more for "the mojo factor" because this voyage was intended to be a
cruise -- carefully planned and uneventful. Shuffleboard on
Tuesday, water aerobics on Wednesday -- like that. Which it was,
until an apparently despondent deer crossed my path on the first
leg of my way home. So here I am, in the dark, in the middle of
Texas hill country, trying to figure out what this wet stuff is all
over the inside of my cab (windshield washer fluid -- whew!). I
didn't even have time to panic, it happened so fast. Everything
seemed to be rolling okay, so I drove on until I could find a place
to camp for the night. This turned out to be a rest area about 20
miles east of Sonora. It was a little late to call back to Art
Lynch (with whom I'd had dinner just a few hours before), so I
called David S. who is two hours earlier and ran down my plan to
get the bus looked over in San Angelo. He gave me the number for
his friends Rob &amp; Kim (from his Mustang life). It was the next
morning that I called Art and he gave me Rex Rogers number in San
Angelo, who's number was incorrect -- oops! It was on the way into
San Angelo that the bus started running badly and actually stalled
at one point (when the idle solenoid stripped out?). Jim, a
stranger on the side of the road, stopped to help and followed me
on to the next town Eldorado. He and Rob hooked me up with John
Talley at J&amp;O in San Angelo. John got my carburetor hooked back
up. He's honest and nice! And he knows VW's. His dad had the local
VW dealer back in the day and he worked there before starting his
own business. I never did get hooked up with Rex, but Art's
assistance was invaluable -- and I'm still stunned that Mike G. was
ready to bring me an engine if it came to that. David and Art got
me through my first valve adjustment. I was really nervous about
getting on the road out of San Angelo, but I made it home just fine
-- another 27 hours of driving! Knowing I had that support network
on the way home made all the difference to me. And made my parents
very happy. Even now, with me at 40, my mom still worries.... :-)

about VW Buses finally caused my parents to break down and let me
buy one. I chose a 1969 Hardtop Westy that I stumbled apon during
some odd circumstances. The previous owner had thrown a rod, so the
engine was toast. I had been working at Dairy Queen for a month or
so, and I had saved up enough cash for a used 1600. I called the
local VW places, but none had one. I finally found an ad in the
paper for some VW stuff and 3 engines. I shelled out $250 for a
1600, and when I got it home I realised that I wasnt any closer to
a running bus. Those mothers sold me a toasted engine. Suffice it
to say, I was not overjoyed about the entire experience, and I was
quite disgruntled about VW's as a whole. Eventually I decided that
the sellers of said engine would have bad karma forever, and that
they would never be happy. I decided to rebuild. This ordeal lead
me to need a head, as all but one of mine were cracked. This is
where the AIRS list comes into the story (finally!). I called
around in search of a head, and Paul Ledbetter told me that indeed,
he had one. A game of telephone tag ensued, and in the end, he told
me he would give me a head for free. 'Hmm does free equal cracked?'
i thought. In the end though, the head is not cracked, and it is
going on the bus engine. Thanks Paul! You restored my faith in VW
people as a whole! Much good karma to you!</p>

contacted me via the AIRS list and asked if they could stop at my
place and work on an oil leak to which I agreed. San Diego has been
having a heat wave and it almost cost us an injury while working on
their '72. We had the van up on jack stands when the stands sunk
into the hot macadam and the van rolled off of the stands.
Fortunately none of us were underneath at the time and there were
no injuries to people or damage to the van. The jack stands would
be stable on concrete or similar surface, but the knife edges of
the base can obviously sink into a soft material. We put the stands
on some 2 x 12 pieces of wood scrap and finished the job. The oil
leak was coming from a push rod tube seal. I am going to shop for
new jack stands, and really pay attention to their safety features
this time around. The stands I have now were bought in 1971 when I
was not so experienced. Chris and Loryn are now making their way up
I-5 to their home in Canada. If you see a blue and white '72 van
with British Columbia plates and surfboard strapped to the roof
give them a wave.

<td height="26" nowrap bgcolor="#808080" width="650">on the way
back from NY to Nebraska last weekend we were cruisin down I90 and
came across a couple in a red Bug on the side of the road. I pulled
over to offer a hand. The couple were going to Niagra Falls coming
from NY city and im surprised how far they actually made it. there
vacuum advance hose was not attached to the dizzy, the carb was
leaking fuel from the base but what actually killed them was i
believe there coil was caput. it had juice goin in but none comin
out. So seeing we could do nothin on the spot i gave them a ride to
the next rest area and broke out my trusty AIRS list. On my second
call I got ahold of Dave Rogge II and he gave me directions and the
phone number of a good air cooled shop in the area that i was able
to pass on. With tow truck on the way i headed out with a little
extra VW karma in tow. So i know it wasnt for a bus, but hey they
were air cooled folk and it only took Dave a minute to find a phone
number and address. so i say "Thanks Dave!" by the way the couple
told me they had been trying to wave people down for help on the
highway and we of course were the only ones who paid any attention.

Anne and Karolyn made it home safely after a multi-month round trip
to Kentucky and back. It was on the last leg of this journey that
they got ahold of me. I got the first email on 11/20/02:<br>
<br></i> Hey there!<br>
<br>
I saw your posting on Type2.com/AIRS and I thought I'd give you a
hollar.<br>
I'm returning from a cross-country trip (CA to KY), and we've
begun<br>
experiencing brake troubles. The front right one is smoking a bit -
and<br>
from the looks of the wheel it looks like I need new calipers. I'm
sure the<br>
pad is also in need of a change, and I should probably do both
sides.<br>
<br>
So I've never done brakes before, but I'm hoping to find someone in
Chico<br>
who can help guide me through the steps to replacing them myself.
After<br>
this trip we're broke, so I can't take her to a shop. Plus after
hearing<br>
what calipers are going to cost...well, there's just no way I can
pay<br>
labour. I've done lots of work on her before, but I don't really
trust<br>
myself to do the brakes alone - at least not the first time.<br>
<br>
So I'm writing to ask if you could help me fix my brakes. :) Even
letting<br>
me know a good parts shop in Chico would help - I'm getting pads in
Redding,<br>
but since they say to take the calipers off and trade them in -
I'll need to<br>
be where I'm going to repair her before I do that.<br>
<br>
We're in French Gulch right now, and we'll head down to Chico
tomorrow.<br>
We'll probably be around for a day or two, but we've gotta get back
home for<br>
thanksgiving. :)P<br>
<br>
Anyway, thanks a lot, and we hope to meet you!<br>
Karolyn<br>
<br>
<i>I read my email only a few hours after it was sent to me and
replied immediately:<br></i><br>
Hey, Karolyn!<br>
<br>
Sorry to hear of your travel challenge! When you get into Chico,
call me on my cell phone (530) XXX-XXXX. We'll go from there to get
you on your way. Unfortunately, I will be working all day tomorrow,
but I can meet you anywhere as soon as you get here. There are 2
great mechanics in town and one of those shops is a gerat parts
supply house, too.<br>
<br>
Give me a call - we'll get you taken care of!<br>
<br>
Be safe -<br>

<i>Anne and Karolyn got into Chico about 6:00PM on 11/20/02 and
called my cell phone. I was working, but only for another hour. I
gave them a map of Chico with some local landmarks (coffee shops,
book stores, cool haunts). After I got off work, we went back to my
garage and began work on the brake. They showed up in a well
travelled '71 Westy that pulled horribly to the right when the
brakes were applied. They had new brake pads and a new rubber brake
hose for the passenger side. First, I felt the hub thinking that it
would be warm if the binders were not releasing. It was not overly
warm to the touch, so we did a brake inspection and found the pads
on the driver's side were almost nonexistent while the pads on the
passenger side were nearly new. That explained the pulling under
application. Because it was late and I had to return to the daily
grind (to support my own VW habit) the next morning, we cheated and
only replaced the pads on the driver's side. I made them promise to
put the passenger side pads on as soon as they got some time and
space. A test drive appeared that the problem was corrected. They
crashed in a spare room, then headed on their way the next morning
(11/21/02).<br>
2 days later I got the "distress" email that is posted on the AIRS
success story board, along with my response. The following is the
rest of the story.</i><br>
<br>
Karolyn -<br>
<br>
BUMMER!! I am sorry to hear that! I don't know anyone down that
way, but, i did forward your email to me to the Vintage Bus email
list I am a part of. There are hundreds of VW Bus people that
subscribe and read this list. From what I know of the list, anyone
who reads and is close will be enroute shortly. Keep me posted, and
if needed, I will get creative.<br>
<br>
Good luck -<br>

Awwww...what a SWEETIE you are! :)P Well, this little town has been
pretty<br>
nice to us so far. It was hectic at first, but we managed to pull
the<br>
calipers off this morning (all by our lonesome...except for two
bolts ;) ).<br>
Now we're just waiting for the two new calipers which are scheduled
to come<br>
in tomorrow afternoon. So...that will put us in SF by Thanksgiving
(we hope<br>
we hope we hope!). I think we may have found someone to help us
out<br>
tomorrow, just in case things get hairy, and from the looks of it
I've got a<br>
lot of email replies to look at - so that's GREAT. :)<br>
<br>
Thanks so much for your help, Greg. You the Man! (Get it? HAHAHA...
;)P )<br>
I'll keep you informed, most definately. :)<br>
<br>
THANKS!!!!!<br>

Sounds like you're going to take this "home by Thanksgiving" theme

out.<br>

Hey<br>
How did things turn out? Did you make it home by Turkey day? Is the
bus going to live?<br>

Hi Greg!<br>
<br>
Anne here. Thank you for getting in touch-- I haven't checked this
account<br>
since we got back. We're taking a VW break to recover from the
trip. :)<br>
We arrived safely back in San Francisco the night before
Thanksgiving. We<br>
were able to find a bit of local help in Middletown, and got the
calipers on<br>
with only a bit of sweating and swearing.<br>
I think the bus will be OK- we need to give it a tune-up and try to
figure<br>
out how to get it out of the rain. What are your thoughts on
rust<br>
prevention? We seem to have developed a bit even since arriving on
the West<br>
coast.<br>
<br>
Thank you for all of your help. Say hi to the family, and have
great<br>
holidays!<br>
