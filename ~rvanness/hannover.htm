As some of you might know, Ben Pon, the founder of the Dutch VW importing
agency, kind of "invented" the Type 2 on a memo page in his organiser. To
commemorate the 40th birthday of the Hannover plant (or "Transporter
stammwerk" in German) a delegation of PON (the agency) was invited to these
celebrations and were kindly asked to bring along a delegation of "vintage"
buses to underline the close relations. I was asked by the PR department of
PON if I wanted to participate through my club contacts at that time. Before
they finished asking I already had accepted.
<P>
At their office in Leusden we assembled and drove off in convoy to Hannover;
escorted by two PR-officials in brand new T4's. They took excellent care of
us; hotel accomodation & meals, gas and a couple of sturdy German beers
where all provided. During our dinner we where joined by VW-design staff who
had helped developing the loaf, very special... I returned without a guilder
spent, really... On the day itself we  were allowed to wander through the
factory and I noticed people taking pictures. So I took my camera out as
well and shot two films full of the production facilities. I think these are
pretty rare material for photographing is normally not allowed inside a car
plant in production...
<P>
These pictures give you an impression of the incredible visit we made to the
place our buses where made. And although the cars depicted are certainly not
"vintage" in any way, it sure gives you an insight of what it must
have been like during those days... Watch my pictures and use your
imagination.

His colleagues offering the dash up for mounting with a sort of robot
arm.  The complete dash, including the ancilaries is installed in one go (about 25 seconds).  Impressive!

Installing a high roof: glue is spread in the roof gutter, then the glassfibre top is placed 
over it. Then, with several knocks with a rubber hammer the roof is installed.  Amazing these do 
not blow off the car on the highway!

The above was a pre-production model.  One shot is with Ivo (a bus buddy) to give you
an impression of its size.  It sstood there in a hallway a bit sorry for itself and neglected.  Man,
this would make the ultimate mantlepiece!  No worries: we did not lay a hand on it...grumble...

This was our courtesy vehicle, provided by the factory, with our own German
one man "Grateful Dead" version...not.  He played during our dinner the
previous night, man did he make me thirsty...

The Eurovan you see on the left belongs to the Dutch version of the "Amish Gazette".  The
18 wheeler you see with the inspiring lady on the back belongs to the network station which
broadcasts erotic films from time to time.  While overtaking us, they were kind of annoying each other
in the fast lane.  That night we had a good laugh about these guys!
