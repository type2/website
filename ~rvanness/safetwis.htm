The Solex carburetors and rebuildable style fuel pumps used on air cooled 
Volkswagens have a weak link that should be safeguarded to prevent the
much dreaded engine fire.  The brass ports can loosen in the aluminum bore into
which they are pressed.  They will then pop out at the most unsuspected time and douse the engine in gasoline.
<P>
To avoid this scenario, one can knurl the brass fitting for a tighter fit, yet that might only temporarily
stave off the inevitable.  Better yet, or
in addition, use stainless steel safety-wire to hold the fuel lines securely against the pump or carb so
that there is no chance they will pop off and cause havoc.

Thanks to a gift from my friend Dale, I'm happy to now have a safety-wire twister in my tool arsenal. 
Dale provided the following illustrations on how we can all do the job right:
