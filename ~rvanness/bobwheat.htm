"As you can see its fitted where the heater
tube would be if I had one. It has an air inlet and exhaust which goes down
through the plinth to underneath the bus. Air is sucked in from the left and
blown across a heat exchanger and out of the right side where there are tubes
attached that take the heat up to the screen. So combustion air and heated air
are kept separate.
<P>
I don't think it would be 'waterproof' enough for an under the van fitting. An
engine bay fitting would be practical especially as the heater is quite small.
But as it recirculates air inside the bus would be best (the same as a Propex
heater in this respect).
<P>
Oh, I included the top half of a floppy disk in the pic for scale."
