&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What follows is the list of parts, services, prices and vendors that went into the building of my 
1600 engine.  Many small items are listed so I think this will make a useful check list for anyone 
building a 1600 (especially a '71 with stock exhaust).  In the course of a rebuild you'll find that 
small, unanticipated things like rubber bits and nuts/washers need replacement--everything I 
encountered is mentioned.  If I don't list an item, I had a good used part that worked (prominent 
examples: engine case, head studs, engine tin).  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prices are what I paid--you might find better deals out there, these are just for your 
reference.  I chose to purchase from certain vendors because I knew from past experience they 
provided high quality.  There are of course many vendors to choose from--in the end who I 
purchased from was based mostly on personal choice all things considered.  Some parts listed 
are extras for future use (additional distributor o-rings, plugs etc.) so my total cost is slightly 
inflated by that.  I list some additional tools I purchased for this rebuild specifically.  The tool 
list is deceptively small because I had a lot of tools to begin with. You'll need special tools that 
I don't list (e.g. piston ring compressor, valve spring compressor, etc.).
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wasn't shooting for a specific bottom line cost when I began.  I simply bought over the course 
of a year the type and quality of parts I wanted to go into my engine as I could afford them.  If 
you can do without certain items or if you choose to "cut corners", you could rebuild a 1600 for 
a whole lot less.  I'd recommend using my figures as a very conservative estimate on the cost 
involved and budget your rebuild from there.  Some people can rebuild a 1600 on a $500 
budget.  In the course of my rebuild I discovered for one reason or another I wouldn't do that.  
I'm the extreme so find a happy middle ground for yourself.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My rebuild isn't complete yet, but this parts list is.  If you have the money, the parts buying part 
is a cinch (just remember you are the final quality control inspector!)--your labor and care in 
interpreting and applying the writings of Wilson, Hoover, Fisher, Berg etc. are what is really 
critical.  I probably wouldn't have embarked on such a grand scale rebuild without Bob Hoover 
especially and all the helpful voices on Ken Hooper's list.  Engine building in general has been 
demystified for me, I now look forward to building even better engines in the future (but 
primarily simply maintaining the one I just built for a long time!).
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good luck with your rebuild!
