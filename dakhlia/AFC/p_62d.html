<h2>Checking / adjust valve clearances</h2><p>

It is important that cylinder heads have cooled down to ambient
temperatures before checking or adjusting valve clearances.<p>
Particularly critical is when the engine itself is still cold after a
short
drive but the cylinder heads have become hot (e.g. when vehicle has been
driven from parking lot into workshop shortly before adjustment).<p>
