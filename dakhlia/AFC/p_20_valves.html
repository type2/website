<h2>Checking and adjusting valve clearances:</h2>
<br>
<br>

With air-cooled engines it is important that the cylinder heads have
cooled down to ambient temperature before checking or adjusting valve
clearance. Particularly critical is when the engine itself is still
cold after a short rive but the cylinder heads have become hot (e.g.
when vehicle has been driven from parking lot into workshop shortly before
adjustment takes place).
