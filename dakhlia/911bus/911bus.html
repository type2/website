  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Or how a wacky 
    idea became reality... Of course, I didn't do the project all by myself, but 
    enrolled the help of various people, shops, and firms along the way. I'll 
    mention them in the text. </font> </p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I got the engine 
    and inspiration from Wm. Kennedy, a former vanagon listmember who did the 
    same 2.2 liter 911 conversion on an early vanagon, hence proving that such 
    a thing is possible. (Search 1994-96 vanagon archives for his posts regarding 
    the conversion.) He later upgraded to a 2.7 liter engine and again to a 3.0. 
    I bought the 2.2 from him, as well as an oil tank. Bill seems like a level-headed 
    and rational person and that perhaps, more than anything else, convinced me 
    that committing my time and money to such a project did not <i>necessarily</i> 
    mean I was crossing the line to insanity.</font> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My bus is (or 
    at least was?) fairly nice and with a properly running type4 engine it would 
    have been comparable to busses I've seen go for $4,000+. It was clear to me 
    from the beginning that cutting up the bus for the conversion had the potential 
    to ruin it, especially if the work was done sloppily. The 911 is a dry-sump 
    engine which draws its oil from a separate tank. Making room for the oil tank 
    is the first big step of the conversion after pulling the old engine and psychologically 
    it's the hardest. You need to cut off the air filter support bracket, cut 
    a large hole in the right battery tray, and cut out most of the sheetmetal 
    that is hiding the fuel filler hose and conceiling the FI ECU. If you don't 
    have an air compressor, the best tool for the task is probably a sawzall, 
    which I rented.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When it comes 
    to the transmission, one faces two choices: use a 901 or 915 tranny (Porsche 
    5-speed) or use the VW tranny. The 901/915 option is undoubtedly the better 
    one, but budget constraints had me keep the VW one. Hence, instead of changing 
    the halfshafts, I needed a special flywheel. The custom flywheel came from 
    K.E.P. (www.kennedyeng.com), a Southern Californian company that makes engine 
    to tranny adapters. It's basically a VW flywheel for the '76+ 091 bellhousing 
    (and 228mm clutch and pressure plate), but with the 6-bolt pattern for the 
    early 911 crankshaft. I also bought their stage I pressure plate to help deal 
    with the bigger torque. </font> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Note: My bus 
    is a '75 with the 215mm clutch found in '74 and '75 models only, but KEP only 
    makes adapters for either the 200mm clutch or the 228mm clutch. I could have 
    gone either way, but figuring that VW increased clutch size as their engine 
    gained power, I decided to go with the more expensive 228mm clutch and flywheel 
    option. The "228" flywheel actually has the same diameter as the "200" or 
    the "215", but it is thicker, hence does not fit '75 and earlier bellhousings. 
    Swapping bellhousings turned out to be very easy, but with the different bellhousing, 
    I also needed a different starter. (Marginal note: although the 091 was also 
    used on vanagons, vanagon starters do not fit. Only '76-'79 starters will 
    do.) Karl von Salzen sent me the starter for free! (Thanks, Karl!) </font> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After shortening 
    the tranny driveshaft by about 1/2" with an angle-grinder, the engine was 
    mated to the tranny. With the help of a friend, the assembled drivetrain was 
    put into place and the bellhousing attached to the transmission carrier. The 
    rear of the engine was supported by the floorjack, while waiting for a custom 
    rear crossbar. </font> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The rear engine 
    crossbar (actually a plate) was fabricated by Rick Babor (Mangobus@aol.com) 
    in St. Louis, Missouri. I couldn't have completed the project without his 
    help: he's clever AND he knows how to weld, a required combination you're 
    unlikely to find just by browsing the Yellow Pages. He also brought a friend 
    along who happened to be an engineer and together we came up with a design 
    that is both solid (at least according to the engineer and I do trust him) 
    and easy to implement. Instead of trying to follow the type4 crossbar model, 
    we opted for a design similar to the way the engine is supported in a 911, 
    basically suspended from above. Rick cut off the sleeves at the ends of the 
    original Porsche crossbar and welded them onto a plate long enough to span 
    the bus's engine bay. The ends of the crossbar rest on the stock Porsche rubber 
    mounts which, together with custom spacers, sit on the corner shelves (the 
    one just right of the left battery tray and the other just left of the right 
    battery tray). The spacers are necessary to keep the rubber mounts "floating".

    </font> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because the original 
    air filter setup is too tall to fit in the engine compartment, I bought a 
    new K&amp;N air filter setup from Steven at Stomski Racing (Jstomski@aol.com). 
    (Steven also provided me with various used Porsche parts, such as the rubber 
    motormounts --they normally cost $100 each new!-- and a fuel pump. He's friendly, 
    helpful, and thorough and his prices are low. Of course, this is a relative 
    concept: parts in the Porsche world seem to be five times that of their VW 
    equivalent, if not more. By the way, I'm not sure I ever told Steven that 
    his parts ended up as transplants into a lower lifeform... :) Anyway, the 
    K&amp;N system was a straightforward installation. </font> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Update (November 
    6, '98):</b> I finally got around to working on the ignition system, which 
    is of the Capacitive Discharge variety. I got the one from Universal Corp. 
    recommended by Bob Hoover. After getting it hooked up, cleaning the points, 
    finding TDC and installing the distributor accordingly, and last but not least 
    getting the sparkplug wires hooked up in the correct firing order, the engine 
    finally came to life. Took the bus for a short 5-minute (but quick!) drive 
    and was relieved to make it without catastrophic failure. Acceleration is 
    nice, very much like that of a "normal" car, say, a late eighties Honda Accord. 
    However, the exhaust was unbearably loud and some oil leaks need attention, 
    too. That and other little bugs will be worked out over the winter, which 
    is rather long up here. I'm looking forward to Spring, which, they say, starts 
    early in May... </font> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Update (December 
    '98):</b> Custom exhaust is installed. I'm not thrilled with the design, noise, 
    and performance, although it does fit neatly.</font> 
  <p><font size="2"><img src="911exhaust.jpg" width="494" height="281"> </font>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Update (July 
    12, 1999):</b> The last few months were chaotic. I've had to deal with a whole 
    series of mechanical problems: </font> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. The first 
    problem was ignition-related. It turned out that what I thought was a regular 
    coil was actually an "ignition voltage transformer" and this part was not 
    compatible with the aftermarket CDI: indeed it fried the module's capacitor. 
    </font> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. The second 
    problem was that the Zenith carbs were impossible to tune. They had major 
    vacuum leaks at the throttle bushings and needed to be rebuilt. I was not 
    willing to take the risk of letting a local shop mess with that, so I had 
    the job done by Motormeister in California. The job cost $700. </font> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. The third 
    problem had to do with the distributor. The rotor failed and had to be replaced, 
    but Marelli parts are NLA <b>anywhere</b>. Thus I had no choice, but to buy 
    a *new* distributor, a Bosch. Another $700. </font> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4. Now there's 
    a problem with low oil pressure at idle and a problem with excessive fuel 
    consumption (12 mpg). I hope the first problem is just the gauge acting up 
    and that the second can be resolved by putting a fuel pressure regulator between 
    pump and carbs... </font> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Update (August 
    5, 1999):</b> Except for a broken accelerator cable and a flat, the bus had 
    no further problems on a 2,000-mile trip from Montreal to Alabama (with some 
    detours). Hills are gone. So are tailgaters... </font> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To finish, here's 
    the cost to date. I'm not including shipping cost for parts. My own time spent 
    wasn't labor, but pleasure (well, at least at the beginning...), hence is 
    valued at $0.</font>

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Grand Total so 
    far is about $3,800. Depending on how you slice it, the engine ended up costing 
    $2,600 and the actual conversion only $1,200. </font> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I'd like to conclude 
    by stressing the fact that this was not a particularly difficult job. The 
    required level of technical skills is moderate: if you have learned to adjust 
    your valves and have helped a friend pull an engine, then you're ready. The 
    more difficult segments of the job can be farmed out, but you'll need time 
    to find the right person. Being a member of your local VW club can be a considerable 
    help. Time is a fairly good substitute for money, too: not only because you 
    can do much of the work yourself or wait for bargains, but also because you 
    can come up with clever and cheaper solutions to your engineering problems. 
    Hence the project can take a week and $10,000 (take your bus to Dieter Wanderer 
    or your vanagon to MSDS, for example) or take a year and cost under $2-3,000. 
    However, this <i>is</i><b> </b>the Porsche world and parts and properly trained 
    labor are <i>very</i> expensive. Feel free to e-mail me with any questions
