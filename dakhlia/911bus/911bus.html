Of course, I didn't do the project all by myself, but     enrolled the help of various people, shops, and firms along the way. I'll     mention them in the text. </font> </p>  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I got the engine     and inspiration from Wm. Kennedy, a former vanagon listmember who did the     same 2.2 liter 911 conversion on an early vanagon, hence proving that such     a thing is possible. (Search 1994-96 vanagon archives for his posts regarding     the conversion.) He later upgraded to a 2.7 liter engine and again to a 3.0.     I bought the 2.2 from him, as well as an oil tank. Bill seems like a level-headed     and rational person and that perhaps, more than anything else, convinced me     that committing my time and money to such a project did not <i>necessarily</i>     mean I was crossing the line to insanity.</font>   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My bus is (or     at least was?) fairly nice and with a properly running type4 engine it would     have been comparable to busses I've seen go for $4,000+. It was clear to me     from the beginning that cutting up the bus for the conversion had the potential     to ruin it, especially if the work was done sloppily. The 911 is a dry-sump     engine which draws its oil from a separate tank. Making room for the oil tank     is the first big step of the conversion after pulling the old engine and psychologically     it's the hardest. You need to cut off the air filter support bracket, cut     a large hole in the right battery tray, and cut out most of the sheetmetal     that is hiding the fuel filler hose and conceiling the FI ECU. If you don't     have an air compressor, the best tool for the task is probably a sawzall,     which I rented.</font></p>  <p><font size="2"><img src="911cut.jpg" width="350" height="231"> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>    </font></font> </p>  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When it comes     to the transmission, one faces two choices: use a 901 or 915 tranny (Porsche     5-speed) or use the VW tranny. The 901/915 option is undoubtedly the better     one, but budget constraints had me keep the VW one. Hence, instead of changing     the halfshafts, I needed a special flywheel. The custom flywheel came from     K.E.P. (www.kennedyeng.com), a Southern Californian company that makes engine     to tranny adapters. It's basically a VW flywheel for the '76+ 091 bellhousing     (and 228mm clutch and pressure plate), but with the 6-bolt pattern for the     early 911 crankshaft. I also bought their stage I pressure plate to help deal     with the bigger torque. </font>   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Note: My bus     is a '75 with the 215mm clutch found in '74 and '75 models only, but KEP only     makes adapters for either the 200mm clutch or the 228mm clutch. I could have     gone either way, but figuring that VW increased clutch size as their engine     gained power, I decided to go with the more expensive 228mm clutch and flywheel     option. The "228" flywheel actually has the same diameter as the "200" or     the "215", but it is thicker, hence does not fit '75 and earlier bellhousings.     Swapping bellhousings turned out to be very easy, but with the different bellhousing,     I also needed a different starter. (Marginal note: although the 091 was also     used on vanagons, vanagon starters do not fit. Only '76-'79 starters will     do.) Karl von Salzen sent me the starter for free! (Thanks, Karl!) </font>   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After shortening     the tranny driveshaft by about 1/2" with an angle-grinder, the engine was     mated to the tranny. With the help of a friend, the assembled drivetrain was     put into place and the bellhousing attached to the transmission carrier. The     rear of the engine was supported by the floorjack, while waiting for a custom     rear crossbar. </font>   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The rear engine     crossbar (actually a plate) was fabricated by Rick Babor (Mangobus@aol.com)     in St. Louis, Missouri. I couldn't have completed the project without his     help: he's clever AND he knows how to weld, a required combination you're     unlikely to find just by browsing the Yellow Pages. He also brought a friend     along who happened to be an engineer and together we came up with a design     that is both solid (at least according to the engineer and I do trust him)     and easy to implement. Instead of trying to follow the type4 crossbar model,     we opted for a design similar to the way the engine is supported in a 911,     basically suspended from above. Rick cut off the sleeves at the ends of the     original Porsche crossbar and welded them onto a plate long enough to span     the bus's engine bay. The ends of the crossbar rest on the stock Porsche rubber     mounts which, together with custom spacers, sit on the corner shelves (the     one just right of the left battery tray and the other just left of the right     battery tray). The spacers are necessary to keep the rubber mounts "floating".     </font>   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="911mount.gif" width="200" height="212"><br>    </font>   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because the original     air filter setup is too tall to fit in the engine compartment, I bought a     new K&amp;N air filter setup from Steven at Stomski Racing (Jstomski@aol.com).     (Steven also provided me with various used Porsche parts, such as the rubber     motormounts --they normally cost $100 each new!-- and a fuel pump. He's friendly,     helpful, and thorough and his prices are low. Of course, this is a relative     concept: parts in the Porsche world seem to be five times that of their VW     equivalent, if not more. By the way, I'm not sure I ever told Steven that     his parts ended up as transplants into a lower lifeform... :) Anyway, the     K&amp;N system was a straightforward installation. </font>   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Update (November     6, '98):</b> I finally got around to working on the ignition system, which     is of the Capacitive Discharge variety. I got the one from Universal Corp.     recommended by Bob Hoover. After getting it hooked up, cleaning the points,     finding TDC and installing the distributor accordingly, and last but not least     getting the sparkplug wires hooked up in the correct firing order, the engine     finally came to life. Took the bus for a short 5-minute (but quick!) drive     and was relieved to make it without catastrophic failure. Acceleration is     nice, very much like that of a "normal" car, say, a late eighties Honda Accord.     However, the exhaust was unbearably loud and some oil leaks need attention,     too. That and other little bugs will be worked out over the winter, which     is rather long up here. I'm looking forward to Spring, which, they say, starts     early in May... </font>   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Update (December     '98):</b> Custom exhaust is installed. I'm not thrilled with the design, noise,     and performance, although it does fit neatly.</font>   <p><font size="2"><img src="911exhaust.jpg" width="494" height="281"> </font>  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Update (July     12, 1999):</b> The last few months were chaotic. I've had to deal with a whole     series of mechanical problems: </font>   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. The first     problem was ignition-related. It turned out that what I thought was a regular     coil was actually an "ignition voltage transformer" and this part was not     compatible with the aftermarket CDI: indeed it fried the module's capacitor.     </font>   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. The second     problem was that the Zenith carbs were impossible to tune. They had major     vacuum leaks at the throttle bushings and needed to be rebuilt. I was not     willing to take the risk of letting a local shop mess with that, so I had     the job done by Motormeister in California. The job cost $700. </font>   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. The third     problem had to do with the distributor. The rotor failed and had to be replaced,     but Marelli parts are NLA <b>anywhere</b>. Thus I had no choice, but to buy     a *new* distributor, a Bosch. Another $700. </font>   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4. Now there's     a problem with low oil pressure at idle and a problem with excessive fuel     consumption (12 mpg). I hope the first problem is just the gauge acting up     and that the second can be resolved by putting a fuel pressure regulator between     pump and carbs... </font>   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Update (August     5, 1999):</b> Except for a broken accelerator cable and a flat, the bus had     no further problems on a 2,000-mile trip from Montreal to Alabama (with some     detours). Hills are gone. So are tailgaters... </font>   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To finish, here's     the cost to date. I'm not including shipping cost for parts. My own time spent     wasn't labor, but pleasure (well, at least at the beginning...), hence is     valued at $0.</font>   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a name="Expenses"></a>     </font>   <center>    <table BORDER width="496" name="expenses" height="483" >      <tr>         <td valign=CENTER width="179" height="11">           <center>            <font size="2"><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Item             </font> </b> </font>           </center>        </td>        <td valign=CENTER width="47" height="11">           <center>            <font size="2"><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cost             </font> </b> </font>           </center>        </td>        <td valign=CENTER width="60" height="11">           <center>            <font size="2"><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Date             </font> </b> </font>           </center>        </td>        <td valign=CENTER width="178" height="11">           <center>            <font size="3"><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Remarks             </font> </b> </font>           </center>        </td>      </tr>      <tr>         <td valign=CENTER width="179" height="34">           <center>            <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1971 2.2             liter 911T engine </font>           </center>        </td>        <td valign=CENTER width="47" height="34">           <center>            <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">$1,000             </font>           </center>        </td>        <td valign=CENTER width="60" height="34">           <center>            <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">November             '95&nbsp; </font>           </center>        </td>        <td valign=CENTER width="178" height="34">           <center>            <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">expect             to pay more, say from $1,500 for a used 2.2 up to $4,000 for a used             3.0.

The     required level of technical skills is moderate: if you have learned to adjust     your valves and have helped a friend pull an engine, then you're ready. The     more difficult segments of the job can be farmed out, but you'll need time     to find the right person. Being a member of your local VW club can be a considerable     help. Time is a fairly good substitute for money, too: not only because you     can do much of the work yourself or wait for bargains, but also because you     can come up with clever and cheaper solutions to your engineering problems.     Hence the project can take a week and $10,000 (take your bus to Dieter Wanderer     or your vanagon to MSDS, for example) or take a year and cost under $2-3,000.     However, this <i>is</i><b> </b>the Porsche world and parts and properly trained     labor are <i>very</i> expensive.
