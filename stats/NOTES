You can include another configuration file from the command line by using 
a command like +gother.cfg. (Note that there is no space between +g and 
the filename; this is true
of all command line arguments.) You can also include another configuration 
file from within a configuration file by a command like 

CONFIGFILE other.cfg
The first file which analog reads is the default configuration file, 
normally called analog.cfg. You can stop this file being read by 
specifying the option -G on the command
line.
