Given the constraint that `routes` cannot be used alongside `rewrites`, `redirects`, `headers`, `cleanUrls`, or `trailingSlash` in Vercel's configuration, you'll need to approach this differently. One possible solution is to use a serverless function to handle the logic for serving files without extensions as HTML.

Here's a revised approach using Vercel's serverless functions:

1. **Create a Serverless Function:**
   - Create a directory called `api` in your project root.
   - Inside the `api` directory, create a file for your serverless function, e.g., `serve-no-ext.js`.

2. **Write the Serverless Function:**
   The function in `serve-no-ext.js` will check the request URL and serve the content as HTML if it doesn't have an extension.

   ```javascript
   const { readFileSync } = require('fs');
   const { join } = require('path');

   module.exports = (req, res) => {
     const { pathname } = new URL(req.url, `http://${req.headers.host}`);
     if (!/\./.test(pathname)) {
       // Trying to serve a file without an extension
       try {
         const content = readFileSync(join(__dirname, '..', pathname));
         res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html');
         res.status(200).send(content);
       } catch (e) {
         res.status(404).send('Not found');
       }
     } else {
       // For other requests, serve as usual
       res.status(404).send('Not found');
     }
   };
   ```

3. **Update `vercel.json` with Rewrites:**
   Use the `rewrites` field to redirect requests for files without extensions to your serverless function.

   ```json
   {
     "version": 2,
     "rewrites": [
       {
         "source": "/([^\\.]+)$",
         "destination": "/api/serve-no-ext"
       },
       // ... your existing rewrites ...
     ]
   }
   ```

This setup uses a serverless function to intercept requests for files without extensions. It attempts to read the corresponding file from the filesystem and sends it back with the `Content-Type` set to `text/html`. If the file is not found, it returns a 404 error.

All other requests, including those for files with extensions and those matching your existing rewrite rules, will be handled as usual. This method keeps your existing `vercel.json` configuration largely unchanged, adding only the necessary rewrite rule for serving files without extensions.

To configure Vercel to serve only files without extensions as HTML, you need to modify the vercel.json file to include a specific route pattern that targets such files. The route pattern should match requests to files without a dot (.) in their names, as the presence of a dot typically indicates a file extension.

Here's an updated vercel.json configuration for your requirement:

json
Copy code
{
  "version": 2,
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/([^\\.]+)$",
      "dest": "/$1",
      "headers": {
        "Content-Type": "text/html"
      }
    }
  ]
}
In this configuration:

"src": "/([^\\.]+)$": This regular expression matches URLs that do not contain a dot (.), which indicates files without an extension. The [^\\.] part negates any character that is a dot, and the + ensures it matches one or more such characters until the end of the string (denoted by $).
"dest": "/$1": Redirects the matched path to the same path on the server.
"headers": { "Content-Type": "text/html" }: Sets the Content-Type header to text/html.
This setup will ensure that only files without extensions are treated as HTML, while files with extensions will be served normally according to their respective MIME types. Remember to test this configuration with your specific project setup to ensure it works as expected.
