To configure Vercel to serve only files without extensions as HTML, you need to modify the vercel.json file to include a specific route pattern that targets such files. The route pattern should match requests to files without a dot (.) in their names, as the presence of a dot typically indicates a file extension.

Here's an updated vercel.json configuration for your requirement:

json
Copy code
{
  "version": 2,
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/([^\\.]+)$",
      "dest": "/$1",
      "headers": {
        "Content-Type": "text/html"
      }
    }
  ]
}
In this configuration:

"src": "/([^\\.]+)$": This regular expression matches URLs that do not contain a dot (.), which indicates files without an extension. The [^\\.] part negates any character that is a dot, and the + ensures it matches one or more such characters until the end of the string (denoted by $).
"dest": "/$1": Redirects the matched path to the same path on the server.
"headers": { "Content-Type": "text/html" }: Sets the Content-Type header to text/html.
This setup will ensure that only files without extensions are treated as HTML, while files with extensions will be served normally according to their respective MIME types. Remember to test this configuration with your specific project setup to ensure it works as expected.
