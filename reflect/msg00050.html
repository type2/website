<pre>I replaced my fuel lines a couple weeks ago, same thing 
happened to me. &quot;it's got an electric fuel pump, the key 
isn't on, so the gas shouldn't spill out&quot; haha! 
I found that a 3/8 drive socket extension makes a great 
plug with or without a clamp.
As for cleaning gas off of the driveway, I pulled out an 
electric fan, put it on high and aimed it at the spilled 
gas. Evaporates the gas and blows fumes away from me.

&gt; some days, I feel like im getting somewhere, and with my manual by my side I
&gt; can do anything.
&gt; that is, until I don't have my manual by my side, and try to do something I
&gt; assume can only be just as easy as other projects I have taken on.
&gt; The project : replace fuel filter
&gt; The mistake : not reading my manual first
&gt; The outcome : lots of gas all over the place
&gt; I really hate to admit it, but damn this was a dumb, and rather dangerous
&gt; move on my part. I am trying to get ready for my trip to the grand canyon
&gt; from san fran, so I went to change the points/condenser/rotor/oil/oil
&gt; filter - I set the timing, and decided to change the fuel filter since I had
&gt; an extra one and some spare time, after all it couldn't be that hard, or
&gt; take much time.
&gt; I crawled under the bus, found where the old one was and pulled off the
&gt; hose. damnit, the CLAMPS, the CLAMPS!!! ahhhh, grab bucket, place under bus,
&gt; contemplate if the gas will continue to pour out, or just stop when however
&gt; much is in the hose comes through. I realized it was going to continue, so I
&gt; wrapped a towel around my face to help with the fumes, found the hose
&gt; spraying gas, and bent it in half. I tied a rag around it to keep it
&gt; pinched, and grabbed the garden hose. I doused the gas that had spilled onto
&gt; the ground with water, hoping to some higher power that nothing would ignite
&gt; it. I decided to play it safe (sure, now!) and call the FD. They came and
&gt; just decided there wasn't really that much, and hosed the rest of it away
&gt; for me, instead of using any chemicals to spread around on it. I watched
&gt; from the side, my head hung in shame. I now reeked of gas, and had half a
&gt; bucket of it that I don't know what to do with. How do you dispose of
&gt; gasoline properly? I don't think I want to use it, since the bucket had
&gt; little dust and stuff sitting in it when I put it under the bus. I'll figure
&gt; something out, for now, its covered and placed out of the way.
&gt; For future reference, what would have been a good clamping devise? I locking
&gt; pliers perhaps?
&gt; I will never ever make that mistake again.
&gt; My Lesson : RTFM (read the freaking manual)
