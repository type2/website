<pre>Hello all,

I know this may seem trivial in light of today's events, but I'm sure it's not trivial to who it happened to.  List member Shawn Olsen had a fire at his home last weekend which destroyed his bus (69 Dormobile, if I'm correct) and garage, severely damaging the rest of his house.  It was sobering for me, thinking about all the flammables I have in my garage attached to my house.  His bus was parked about 10 feet in front of the garage and burned completely except for engine, tranny and BN4 heater (fuel tank did not ignite, luckily).  The heat melted the headlight lenses and completely burned an aluminum ladder he had in the bus.  His bug parked on the street had some blistered paint as well.  No injuries as his son got out of the house in time and Shawn wasn't home.  I dropped by and chatted with him yesterday; a big mess to clean up and figure out, but spirits are OK as no one hurt.  As tragic as this is, it does force one to put things in perspective as to what is really important.  Still, it made me cringe when I saw the burned up bus.  He thinks the fire was electrical and started around his compressor in the garage, right by a cabinet with paint.  Fortunately, he was properly insured.

Just thought I'd let the list know, as it's probably far from his mind.  Also, might not be a bad idea to evaluate what flammables you have in your garage and their location with regard to potential ignition sources.  Sure made me think.  

Include him in your thoughts and prayers as well as those who've suffered tremendous losses in today's horrible events.

Give blood if you can and make it a regular habit if you don't already.
