<pre>Good Morning,

I have recently subscribed to the t2 list as I have acquired a 78 bus that
has been sitting for about 8 years.  I have a 68 double cab that I am
doing major rust repair on as well.

I have been working on VW's since 1966 and have several bugs.

My problem is this....

On the 78 T2 since it has been sitting so long, all of the metal lines are
full of varnish(hard varnish too!)  I have been working on them this
morning and it is a slow process.

I checked the tech library and found only one reference...
I really don't want to have to pull the tank yet.  

I am now working my way up thru the short take off's from the fuel tank.

Are there any sort of filters in the tank on either the gas feed or return
lines(like on a bug)?

The fuel pump appears to run, although I can't test it until I can get the
tank and pressure return lines cleaned out.

I would really like to keep the fi system unless it has a major problem,
but would like to get up to the point where I have fuel to it.  

Am I wasting my time?  Are the injectors going to be in as bad a shape as
the fuel lines?  If someone else has done this, how bad was it?  Do I just
need to rip everything out and dump it carb cleaner for a couple of days?

If it is fairly hopeless on the fi because of the varnish, what is a
*good* alternative...dual carbs?...which ones?  

This appears to be the original 2.0 engine and the car has 132,000 miles
on it.

The engine turns over well, and the oil was changed within a 1,000 miles
of the odometer reading.  The plugs looked ok after I got them out, just
looked like they had been running very rich.  I've replaced lots of the
vacum and smaller lines in the engine bay.  I would like to get it
running...even badly...before I have to pull the engine, just so I know
how it sounds....

Cheers, dave
