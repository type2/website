<pre>Oh god, a thread I shouldn't mess with, but I'm gonna
step right on in.

I've been a motorcycle rider for 15 years. I've had
some standards, one cruiser, and two sportbikes, both
of which I currently own. 

I've been doing VW's just as long, and can't count all
of those that I've owned at this point. 

I still don't get the Harley thing, and here's why - a
vintage car has a right to be slow, expensive to buy
and maintain, and a lot of work to keep on the road. A
brand-new motorcycle has no business being any of
these things. 

Rather than using myself as an example, I'll use my
father, since he rides big cruisers, and nothing but.
Every time he goes to get a new bike, he looks at a
Harley for the &quot;cach&#xE9;,&quot; but always buys a Japanese
cruiser. Why? As he has repeatedly explained to me, he
wants to ride his motorcycles as much as possible, not
work on them. The thrill of the open road is only
there when your bike is not in the shop. That, and he
gets twice the bike for half the money. How do you
argue with that?

Also, take note - there's nothing different about a
Harley, other than being overpriced and difficult to
maintain. They make a ton of them, and every dentist
and accountant I know has one. Just being a biker is
different enough.

&gt; Ahhh, Friday!
&gt; Let me start by saying that I am not now, nor have I
&gt; ever been a motorcycle rider. Down the street from
&gt; me there are a couple of guys who are Harley
&gt; Davidson bikers. Nice enough guys, but those bikes
&gt; used to just kill me.  They go rumbling by all night
&gt; making ALL THAT NOISE! I have never understood the
&gt; appeal of the Harley. Then last night a buddy came
&gt; over to the house to show me his &quot;new&quot; Harley soft
&gt; tail. It was loud, way too expensive, and he says
&gt; that you really have to baby them and give them a
&gt; lot of maitenance attention. So I asked him why not
&gt; spend HALF the money, get a honda or kawasaki bike
&gt; in better shape that requires less maintenance and
&gt; runs quieter.  To which he promptly responded:
&gt; &quot;Well, why don't you get a Ford Aerostar or Plymouth
&gt; Voyager Mini-van that runs quieter, is more
&gt; reliable, and requires less maintenance than all
&gt; those VW buses?!?!&quot;   Ahhhhhhh, NOW I GET THE HARLEY
&gt; APPEAL!!!  It's about style, it's about truth, it's
&gt; about hitting the open road and b!
&gt; eing different!  If I ever decide to buy a
&gt; motorcycle, I think I'm gonna get a Harley!
