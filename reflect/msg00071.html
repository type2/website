<pre>Hey everyone....

Next weekend is looking to be perfect weather down here at the beach.  If
you havenet heard or thought of going to Busses by the Sea, heres your
chance.

The campout this year has been moved to Frontier Town Campgrounds 5 miles
from Assateaque Island and Ocean City MD.  Frontier Town is a western themed
campground with a with miniature gold, swimming, playgrounds, and a FREE
waterpark.  Like Ron said, it is an excellent place to bring the family.  I
was fortunate enough to secure the peninsula of the campgrounds.  This area
is surrounded on 3 sides by water and will make the perfect back drop for
this event with plenty of room for EVERYONE!!! No need for reservations.
There are excellent facilities and a pool and playground very close by.
Dogs and Alcohol are permitted by those responsible.  So please respect the
place and we'll have a home for BBS for many years to come.

Saturday night has been something of a debate and quite possibly may come to
a group consensus.  The current plan is to saddle up after dinner and take
the 5 mile caravan to Assateaque Island for a beach bonfire.  Assateaque is
a beautiful Federal/State park with wild ponies everywhere.  Quite a site to
see.  A few people have voiced some concerns about drinking and driving and
having to pull camp to go somewhere in the evening.  I'm open for
suggestions.  If everyone thinks it would be better to take a daytime beach
trip to assateaque and have the big fire right at Frontier Town then that's
what we'll do.  I might even have a engine case on hand to throw in the
fire. Please email me and give me your opinions on this.

Last but not least....   Although there are no reservations required, I have
told the campgrounds I would keep an ear out for expected attendance.
Please Please Please email me again and tell me if you are coming or even
thinking of coming and how many are with you.  

For all the info, pictures and directions go to <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://bus.beachin.net">http://bus.beachin.net</a>  

That's all for now
Emmet


PS.  Theres a nice group of northern people comin, wheres all the
southerners??!!

&gt; &gt; This promises to be a great time so dont miss out.


This indeed looks like it will be a great weekend - especially if next
weekend's weather equals this one's (85 and sunny). A caravan to Assateaque
Island is scheduled on Saturday night with a beach bonfire. The campground
is very kid friendly, should be great for a last-of-season shore weekend.
Evon, Haley (3 years old) and I will be going Saturday morning thru Sunday
(unless the weather is lousy).   Hopefully we'll see many of you there!
