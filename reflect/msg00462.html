<pre>saw th following in re.autos.marketplace (that's all I know)

in article &lt;9nufns$k8l$1@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx&gt;, Bushman says...
&gt;
&gt;I have advertised this van before, but I didn't know enough about it to
&gt;describe it beyond a one-line ad. Following is a write-up by the woman who
&gt;owns it:
&gt;
&gt;1977 Volkswagen Westphalia vanagan.
&gt;Hello, thankyou for your interest in my &quot;bus&quot; as they are fondly called by
&gt;longterm owners.  I bought this bus three years ago when it's one and only
&gt;owner, an elderly woman from Storm Lake, Iowa was retiring to a nursing
&gt;home.  This bus had a nice story; a grandma &amp; grandpa had bought it new
&gt;when grandpa retired (grandma of course didn't work outside of home and
&gt;community)  They bought it to take trips in, and they did, 70,000 miles
&gt;they put on this bright sunshine-coloured bus before grandpa died rather
&gt;suddenly leaving grandma without a partner to travel with.  She put the bus
&gt;in the garage, and it stayed there for the next 10 years; immaculate but
&gt;unused, unfunned.  So, that's the story.
&gt;When I bought her it was truely an immaculate vehicle,and wonderful except
&gt;for all the seals had dried out over time and needed to be replaced.  The
&gt;engine seals,transmission, brake system,heating system,etc.  I had it
&gt;thoroughly gone over  by a very competent shop in Minneapolis  called The
&gt;Volkswagon Man, a vw repair place located on Hennepin Ave.  All in all it
&gt;cost me about 2000.00 to upgrade the systems, including a good musical
&gt;sound system.
&gt;  I'd like five thousand for the machine.  It is a very surprising vehicle
&gt;because it has virtually no rust.  Ideally I would like to see it sold to
&gt;someone who loves vw's, because that's what it deserves, to be cared for.
&gt;It would make a great vehicle for family camping.  I initially bought it
&gt;for just such a purpose; we were moving from Minneapolis to a farm in
&gt;northeast Iowa.  Well, I still have the farm but I am no longer able to
&gt;support this vehicle, and am offering it for sale to the highest bidder
&gt;over 3500.00.  I bought it for 5 and have about 7 into it so that seems
&gt;real fair to me.  Also, if you take care of this machine it will not lose
&gt;its' value, infact, it will increase and that's not something you can say
&gt;about many vehicles. This vehicle will still be worth five thousand dollars
&gt;next year, keep it five years and it will be worth more.
&gt;  I am especially interested in solar applications for a bus of this type.
&gt;It has a sink, a folding table, built-in cooler, kitchen cabinets, ample
&gt;clothing storage, water storage,etc.  The top pops up to become a second
&gt;story loft space,complete with screen window, greatly increasing one's
&gt;comfort in moving around the vehicle to prepare a meal,etc. It sleeps four
&gt;easily.
&gt;  This vehicle can be viewed in Decorah, Iowa or LaCrosse,Wisconsin,
&gt;whichever conveniences you.
&gt;
&gt;  Thankyou for your interest.
&gt;
&gt;                       Sincerely,
&gt;
&gt;                        Gaianne Marie Jocquin
