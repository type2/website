<pre style="margin: 0em;">
Good morning folks!

</pre><tt>I did a shade tree paint job on our '78 a couple of years ago with good 
</tt><tt>results and I'm STILL trying to finish the restore job (along came baby, 
</tt><tt>mortgage, job, car payment, etc. etc.!)
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

&lt;grin!&gt;

</pre><tt>If you are going to do painting, hurry because you'll need a relatively dry 
</tt><tt>(not humid) and warm day (70 degrees+ is nice) and depending on where you 
</tt><tt>live, they are getting to be in short supply this year.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Our Westy was my first automotive repaint by myself though I had helped 
</tt><tt>several times on others.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>What I learned from the local automotive body and paint supply store is 
</tt><tt>that they can mix any color you want. The quantities can vary from a pint 
</tt><tt>to a gallon. They can also make up a spray can for you if you want to do it 
</tt><tt>that way.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>No need to mail-order paint or visit a Foreign Car supplier - any Body Shop 
</tt><tt>Supply store can supply any color. NAPA and some of the better auto parts 
</tt><tt>stores also carry automotive body supplies and paint. (Some NAPA's do and 
</tt><tt>some don't).
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>If you need to just do a quick touch up - most of the same parts and paint 
</tt><tt>suppliers carry what looks like nail polish bottles of paint in any color. 
</tt><tt>They can also supply tiny spray cans (1/2 the size, twice the price of the 
</tt><tt>large cans of normal general purpose paint) of any color.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Beware - if you paint is old, you might have a hard time matching the 
</tt><tt>colors. A paint store can sometimes modify their recipe to allow for aged 
</tt><tt>paint.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Shop around. Find a supplier  that can (and will) answer questions. For me 
</tt><tt>that was more important than budget prices. I lucked out and our little 
</tt><tt>town (25K people) has 3 stores to choose from.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Ask about the different types of paints - lacquer (don't do it), acrylic 
</tt><tt>enamel (what I used), 2 part paints (base+clear =&gt; nice! this is what the 
</tt><tt>new cars come with), etc.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>With the acrylic enamel (plus hardener) you can spray it on, you can brush 
</tt><tt>it on, and you can use a fine nap foam roller. I used a roller on 
</tt><tt>automotive paints when I worked for a sign shop with excellent results. It 
</tt><tt>would be a good alternative for a basic scratch or scrape cover up. And yes 
</tt><tt>I did signs when they were hanging AND when they were laying horizontal. It 
</tt><tt>really works.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>(Roll the paint on - unthinned - normally. Go drink something or goof off 
</tt><tt>for a while, ~20 minutes. After the paint is really tacky and setting up, 
</tt><tt>go back over the paint lightly with the same roller, no new paint. You 
</tt><tt>might have to do it again touching it REALLY lightly.)
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>You can also check around and see what your local body shops would charge 
</tt><tt>for a panel re-spray.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>A couple of years ago - exactly a week after we bought our first new car - 
</tt><tt>some kid keyed the side of our Honda at the university where we work. I had 
</tt><tt>thoughts of murder on my mind. Took it to our insurance agency who 
</tt><tt>recommended a shop locally. They re-sprayed the right side 2 doors and 
</tt><tt>reassembled it (I made them pull the molding off, etc.)  for a couple 
</tt><tt>hundred dollars. Excellent job. Quality matched rest of the car. (Never 
</tt><tt>park a car in an area where people walk between the cars going somewhere 
</tt><tt>else. Park it against the wall or whatever.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Anyhow might be cheaper to go that route.

It might be...
Ciao!
