<pre>Went to Phoenix Az. today to pick up a fan from the bone yard for the 2
liter today and also asked about the bolt I was looking for in my last post.
We looked through a lot of flywheels but none looked like the one from my 75
1800cc. I'm Starting to get nervous that one little 12 point socket head
bolt is going to stop me from getting my bus broke in before the snow falls.
Even tried to stop at a VW Dealer but got there about 2 minutes after they
locked the doors for the day. All those shiny new bugs out front! Beautiful!
But not a single air-cooled, even on the repair shop lot. Some how I don't
think they would have been too concerned with helping me get one bolt for an
air cooled engine anyway. So, I returned to Flagstaff without the desired
replacement to hold my clutch to the pressure plate. : (

Any ideas anyone? I do have a clutch and pressure plate from the 78 2000cc
engine that has all of the hex head bolts in good shape. I have been told
that I would need to change the starter and maybe the bell housing on the 75
trans. to put these together. After looking at the ring gear on both
flywheels I think this is true, at least the starter part. Please, does
anyone have one of these bolts they could part with, or know of a suitable
replacement? Maybe a Torx head? Don't know what grade these bolts should be
to stand up to years of use. or where to get a 7 mm bolt of any kind in N.
Az.
Any help would be most appreciated.
Thanks,
Tom

&gt; On inspection of the bolts that hold the pressure plate to the flywheel
&gt; I found one that has a stripped head. These are 12 point socket heads. 7
&gt; mm I think. Took one to the local bolt and nut shop, they said what the
&gt; H--- is that. Don't stock it, can't order it!
&gt;
&gt; No VW Dealer in my area, and no busses in the bone yard around here.
&gt; Does anyone know where I can get one of these? I don't think there is
&gt; room to use standard bolts in place of the socket head bolts.
&gt;
