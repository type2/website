<pre>I just repaired some leaks on my 78. I had to replace the fuel filler
neck(was not the source of the leak,but was cracked) and the hose going from
the fuel filler pipe to the tank. This hose is not available anywhere. I
tried using
radiater hose and that swelled up and looked like crap after two weeks. I
ended up finding a good used one.
If you try used ones give them a squeeze and look for cracks and make sure
it's still pliable. If you can't find a
used one go to a marine supply store and try to match up with some of their
fuel hose. They have some large
sizes and some different connectores that might work. If I couldn't find a
used one I was going to cut back
the metal filler pipe so the hose would make a nice sweep to the tank and
use a piece of marine gas hose.
Let me know what you find and use. Also you have to pull the engine to do
this.

&gt; This is on a 79 type2 micro. 2 liter. Anyway, All of the sudden I am
&gt; having a gas leak in the area of the firewall on the drivers side. I
&gt; first noticed it after filling up w/ gas. it was dripping from somewhere
&gt; I couldn't see. the fuel lines on this side of the tank seem dry. I can
&gt; see it very well at a piece of foam that is sticking out from behind the
&gt; firewall.
&gt;
&gt; It goes away after sitting for a few minutes. I have tried to recreate
&gt; it by both running just the fi pump &amp; running the engine while sitting
&gt; still, but I cannot recreate the leak. The only thing which seems common
&gt; to both leaks is a hard right turn before turning off the engine. I have
&gt; needed to pull the engine to fix some oil leaks but now it seems that I
&gt; will have to pull the tank as well just to get some piece of mind.
&gt; Anyone know what might cause such a leak?
