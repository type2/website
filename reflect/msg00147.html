Hello all,

On one of the more horrific and unfortunately memorable days in US history,
we were humbled by a telephone call from our buddy Tom Niedernhofer a
moment ago.  He works for the US Army Corps of Engineers (and might soon be
assisting in structural evaluation and search and rescue - his specialties
- in NYC) and he was on the Internet and saw posts from some of other our
VW friends who, in the middle of this horrible disaster, were thinking of
my wife Kathryn and I.  For those of you who don't know, Kathryn and I are
flight attendants for TWA (just bought by, and soon to become a part of
American Airlines).  As you know by now, the terrorists hijacked at this
point four commercial jets, two from American Airlines and two from United
Airlines, and used them to cause massive damage and untold casualties. 
Kathryn was actually at work this morning boarding passengers onto a MD-82
bound for Ontario, CA.  Once all USA flights were immediately cancelled,
she assisted the folks off the planes into the terminal, which in turn was
then evacuated.  She decided that since she wasn't going anywhere today, it
was time to go home, where I was enjoying a day off and safely watching the
TV coverage.  So I am pleased to be able to let you know that we are both
safe and sound together in our home near St. Louis.

Unfortunately, we have all lost a lot of our citizens, both on the ground
and in the air.  Personally, as a flight attendant trained for all types of
emergencies including extensive hijacking training, nothing can prepare you
and your fellow comrades in uniform for what it must have been like inside
those airplanes today.  Our prayers go out to all that were injured or lost
their lives today, and to their families and survivors.  I have flown as a
B/A for just over 25 years, and my wife for over 31 years, and it is an
unusual, but very safe and fairly interesting occupation, until something
like today happens.  It's just unbelievable!  

I for one am hoping that we bomb the bastards who planned and executed
these attacks against all of us back to the Stone Age.  Violence seems to
be the only thing these assholes understand, and I hope that our armed
services get the opportunity to air deliver as much of our high-dollar,
high-tech violence as possible to the guilty ASAP.  It sure won't bring
anyone back, but it'll sure make most of us feel a lot better that the
perpetrators of this attack against our country don't get away with this
&quot;scott free&quot;.

Thanks again for the concern for us that some of you have already expressed
via phone and Internet, and rest assured that we are both fine and happy to
be together today.

Bill ( &amp; Kathryn) Bowman

p.s.   Please say a prayer for my parents who during all of this are
currently airborne in a TWA widebody jet from London, England nonstop to
St. Louis today.  We aren't sure where they are or where they will land. 
They had planned to visit with us for 4-5 days.  Up to this point it sounds
like they'll be landing in Canada so far.  Cross your fingers for us
please!
