<pre>Hello All,

Was wondering if anyone knew of a suitable replacement to the plug/barrel
nut on the side of a Solex carb?  I pulled it out for the first time
(bought the carb new three years ago) to swap out the main jet and the
sucker has about a quarter of a thread out of three left?!?!?!?!  Tried the
local yards to no avail and am a little leary of putting another piece of
junk back in there.  Not sure how those aluminum threads will hold up in
the bowl.  Was also thinking of just getting a short bolt to put in there
but the original was hollow, would having a solid bolt have any adverse
effects?  If not, would stainless be the best bet?

One piece of advice when pulling jets that I didn't realize.  The main jet
is on the opposite side of the bowl from the plug and this allows the jet
to roll wherever it wants inside the bowl once unscrewed.  If you are
trying to do swap jets with the carb installed be sure to have some means
of keeping tabs on the jet to get it out.  I had my carb off and was quite
surprised when I unscrewed the jet, put my hand over the hole and tipped it
upright.  Heard the jet fall but there wasn't anything in my hand.  I
cursed and started looking around on the floor but then heard it roll again
and realized the situation.  Several shakes later and out she came.  To
install you also need a way of holding onto the jet to get it to the
hole...

Greatly appreciate any and all advice/suggestions, you guys are the best
and thanks!
