<pre>some days, I feel like im getting somewhere, and with my manual by my side I
can do anything.
that is, until I don't have my manual by my side, and try to do something I
assume can only be just as easy as other projects I have taken on.
The project : replace fuel filter
The mistake : not reading my manual first
The outcome : lots of gas all over the place
I really hate to admit it, but damn this was a dumb, and rather dangerous
move on my part. I am trying to get ready for my trip to the grand canyon
from san fran, so I went to change the points/condenser/rotor/oil/oil
filter - I set the timing, and decided to change the fuel filter since I had
an extra one and some spare time, after all it couldn't be that hard, or
take much time.
I crawled under the bus, found where the old one was and pulled off the
hose. damnit, the CLAMPS, the CLAMPS!!! ahhhh, grab bucket, place under bus,
contemplate if the gas will continue to pour out, or just stop when however
much is in the hose comes through. I realized it was going to continue, so I
wrapped a towel around my face to help with the fumes, found the hose
spraying gas, and bent it in half. I tied a rag around it to keep it
pinched, and grabbed the garden hose. I doused the gas that had spilled onto
the ground with water, hoping to some higher power that nothing would ignite
it. I decided to play it safe (sure, now!) and call the FD. They came and
just decided there wasn't really that much, and hosed the rest of it away
for me, instead of using any chemicals to spread around on it. I watched
from the side, my head hung in shame. I now reeked of gas, and had half a
bucket of it that I don't know what to do with. How do you dispose of
gasoline properly? I don't think I want to use it, since the bucket had
little dust and stuff sitting in it when I put it under the bus. I'll figure
something out, for now, its covered and placed out of the way.
For future reference, what would have been a good clamping devise? I locking
pliers perhaps?
I will never ever make that mistake again.
My Lesson : RTFM (read the freaking manual)
