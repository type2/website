<pre>Hi everybody,  
You people have helped me out so much in the past and it is always greatly appreciated.  I just drove my bus out to Cleveland OH from NJ.  The bus drove just fine all the way out here and even for a month after that.  For the last week, we have had nothing but rain and it finally ended in time for the weekend which I spent under and behind my bus scratching my head. What happened was this: my bus usually drives just right- good oil temp/ pressure( have guages), would always start right up, idle fine, etc. sometimes it would slightly stall in the rain when braking, but otherwise it wouldnt.  Starting about a week ago, the bus started to stall out-especially when braking.  It eventually got to the point were it wouldnt idle.  Now it doesnt idle at all.  I suspected a leak in the brake vacuum hoses because it would mostly stall when braking, but when i plugged the nipple on the intake manifold, the problem persisted.  I blew air through the idle screw hole and idle mixture hole-to clean them, There is plenty of fuel getting to the carb.  The car starts up nice, but doesnt idle at all.  
Here are the specs:
71 westy, 1600dp (3000 miles on it), 100 cam, 34pict3, 009, bugpack header w/ qp muffler, timing set at 8deg btdc static, points and condenser were replaced since breakdown.  Valves were properly adjusted also.
 I have set everything to where it was when the car was running nice, but the problem still happens.  I talked to my local VW mechanic in Jersey and he is stumped.  I will lose my job if i dont get my car running soon.  Please help me out. It will be really appreciated.  Also if anyone knows what's up with the VW scene in the Cleveland OH let me know....
