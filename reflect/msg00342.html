<pre style="margin: 0em;">
Greetings, folks:

</pre><tt>I got the seat pedestal mats in my 1970 over the weekend.  Installing the 
</tt><tt>mats went without too much trouble and didn?t take much time; prepping the 
</tt><tt>area took longer.  There was a lot of crud under the remains of the old 
</tt><tt>mats: horsehair bits from the old seat pads, grime, some rust, globs of 
</tt><tt>adhesive that appeared to have been added somewhat recently, and some other 
</tt><tt>stuff you don't want to know what it was.  I got rid of most of that with a 
</tt><tt>putty knife, a 3M grey sanding pad, a dash of paint thinner, and a lot of 
</tt><tt>Simple Green (?The Only Solvent That?s Better Is Mom Spit!? [tm]).  I 
</tt><tt>treated the rust and hit it with primer and some NAPA spray paint [Spinnaker 
</tt><tt>Blue] that?s amazingly close to the unfaded parts of the original blue.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Luckily for me, Mike B. from the list lives only 3-4 miles from me, and he 
</tt><tt>has a nice low-mileage 1970 with the original mats in good condition, so I 
</tt><tt>could see what they actually look like in place. I?m glad I did, because 
</tt><tt>[list veterans, hold your giggles until the end of the story] I didn?t 
</tt><tt>realize that there were long metal clips along each side of the seat that 
</tt><tt>are meant to anchor the edge of each of the two-mat assembly.  Since the 
</tt><tt>edges of the old mats had long ago torn off from the rest, leaving the long 
</tt><tt>flat strip inside the clips, it wasn?t very obvious that the clips WERE 
</tt><tt>clips until I saw Mike?s originals. The strips were torn off so sharply, so 
</tt><tt>long ago, that I thought I was looking at the finished edges of the old mats 
</tt><tt>until I got a look at Mike's.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>If I?d had more helping hands, I would have fit the new mat edges under the 
</tt><tt>clips first ? inserting the mats upside-down,  then crimping the clips down 
</tt><tt>with a hammer and punch to hold the mats, then flipping the mats over, 
</tt><tt>forming a sharp crease along the clips, and then letting the mats fall into 
</tt><tt>place.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Since I didn?t have enough hands to do that [working alone, it?s nearly 
</tt><tt>impossible to keep the mat edges under the clips while you?re trying to 
</tt><tt>crimp the clips down - the mats? own weight pulls them free], I took 
</tt><tt>advantage of the warm September sun and let the mats get good and limber, 
</tt><tt>then put them in place and tucked the edges down into the clips using the 
</tt><tt>tip of a screw driver.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>I?m kind of glad I did it that way anyway, because I have a feeling the new 
</tt><tt>mats need a few days to relax and stretch a little once they?re in place. 
</tt><tt>They just aren?t sitting quite 100% right in a couple of places: inside 
</tt><tt>front corners, and at the bottom of the seat back where the curved 
</tt><tt>indentation is.  So for now I?ve ducked the issue that Chuck M. and Ronnie 
</tt><tt>F. raised ? to use adhesive, or not to use adhesive?  At the moment, the 
</tt><tt>mats are held down by their own weight, the metal clips [loosely], the seat 
</tt><tt>belt hardware, the edges of the front and walk-through mats, and the trim 
</tt><tt>strips at the bottom of the seat backs [three rivets to drill out on each 
</tt><tt>side, replacing them with screws]. My plan is to wait for the next sunny 
</tt><tt>weekend day [which, I hope, will be soon], then take all the hardware off, 
</tt><tt>try adjusting the mats a little better, and attach it all a little more 
</tt><tt>permanently.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>I imagine that, when the time comes, I?ll only use the minimum 3M trim 
</tt><tt>adhesive [tube, not spray] needed to hold the inside pieces in place, and no 
</tt><tt>adhesive on the outside pieces ? since the latter are held in place by a 
</tt><tt>long clip and really have no place to shift to once they?re correctly in 
</tt><tt>place.  The inside pieces, which have to wrap around three sides of the 
</tt><tt>pedestal and hang vertically rather than lying flat, may need a little bit 
</tt><tt>more help.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Hope someone finds this helpful. I realize it?s a little hard to visualize 
</tt><tt>some of it if you?re not standing there with the mats spread out in front of 
</tt><tt>you. That was part of the problem for me, too. It's a left-brain thing.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>But even though it?s not yet a permanent installation, and there are a 
</tt><tt>couple of places that aren?t right yet if you know where to look for them, 
</tt><tt>it looks pretty good, and the bus has sort of a new-bus smell again, 
</tt><tt>probably for the first time since Nixon was president.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Meanwhile, I have one last question: It appears that, even after those mats 
</tt><tt>are in correctly, there?s still a length of the painted metal on each 
</tt><tt>pedestal that is exposed - about 10? long and 2? wide, along the top edge of 
</tt><tt>the pedestals along the walk-through.  Why don?t the mats cover these 
</tt><tt>places?
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Thanks to all.

best,

Bill
