<pre>Hi All,

My wife is giving me a guilt trip about owning a bus instead of a 2002 vehicle, so I'm regrettably letting it go. This is the nicest original late model bus I've ever owned or seen for that matter. I'm the second owner of this '72 7 Passenger Station Wagon. I bought it from a nice old guy named Burt Young who purchased it new from Hegeman VW in St. Louis County. Burt drove it on the weekends till about 1983 when the engine gave out. He took it in and didn't like the price quote for a new Type IV engine, so he opted for a used Type 1. Whoever did it for him didn't do it the best possible way and it was then put up in his garage till this summer. I then purchased it from Burt and replaced the engine with an all new 1641cc. The previous engine wasn't mounted correctly and the engine compartment wasn't sealed off properly. So I modified some engine mounts from a pre-71 bus and bought a custom engine filler panel from Creative Car Craft in Florida -- <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.creativecarcraft.com/notforbug.htm">http://www.creativecarcraft.com/notforbug.htm</a> ...It worked out quite nicely and thus has been properly converted to Type 1 power. So now, pretty much, the only difference between this bus and a '71 is the tail lights. It has a rebuilt stock carb and a new .009 with electronic ignition. Also all new fuel lines, exhaust, fuel filter, chrome air filter, tires, brake shoes plus other miscellaneous stuff.

This bus is so well preserved, I almost cried when I found it. It has the original paint (2 tone: Chianti Red and Cream White) and very shiny. There is some paint chips and a slight parking lot ding (no paint broken). There is some surface rust up in the rain gutters that I'm going to fix before it gets sold. It still has the original dealership label on the back near the VW badge. The interior (white) is original and phenomenal, there is a slight bit of surface rust under the driver's floor mat, everything else is flawless. Everything electrical is perfect......I'm using the word &quot;perfect&quot;. The front end is tight as ever, it could use some rear shocks though, they're a little squeaky.

I'm asking $5,000 for it. This is exactly how much I have into it. The engine and all work was professionally done by Motor Cars of St. Louis. Email or call for pictures.
